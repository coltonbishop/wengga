p100
aVCHAPTER I.
p101
aVTHE TWO WANDERERS.
p102
aVA man and a boy were ascending a steep street in a country town in\u000aEastern New York.
p103
aVThe man was tall and dark-complexioned, with a\u000asinister look which of itself excited distrust.
p104
aVHe wore a slouch hat,\u000awhich, coming down over his forehead, nearly concealed from view his\u000alow, receding brow.
p105
aVA pair of black, piercing eyes looked out from\u000abeneath the brim.
p106
aVThe first impression produced upon those who met him\u000awas that he was of gipsy blood, and the impression was a correct one.
p107
aVWhere he was born no one seemed to know; perhaps he did not himself\u000aknow, for all his life he had been a wanderer, but English was the\u000atongue that he spoke, and, apart from the gipsy dialect, he knew no\u000aother.
p108
aVHis companion was a boy of fourteen.
p109
aVBetween the two there was not\u000athe slightest resemblance.
p110
aVThough embrowned by exposure to the sun\u000aand the wind, it was easy to see that the boy was originally of light\u000acomplexion.
p111
aVHis hair was chestnut and his eyes blue.
p112
aVHis features were\u000aregular and strikingly handsome, though, owing to the vagrant life\u000ahe was compelled to lead, he was not able to pay that attention to\u000acleanliness which he might have done if he had had a settled home.
p113
aVIt was five o'clock in the afternoon, and the boy looked weary.
p114
aVHe\u000aseemed scarcely able to drag one foot after the other.
p115
aVHis companion\u000aturned upon him roughly.
p116
aV"What are you dawdling that way for, Tony?"
p117
aVhe demanded.
p118
aV"You creep\u000alike a boy of three."
p119
aV"I can't help it, Rudolph," said the boy, wearily; "I'm tired."
p120
aV"What business have you to be tired?"
p121
aV"I've walked far to-day."
p122
aV"You've walked no farther than I. I don't dawdle like you."
p123
aV"You're a man.
p124
aVYou're stronger than I am, Rudolph."
p125
aV"And you're a milksop," said the man contemptuously.
p126
aV"I'm nothing of the sort," said the boy, with a flash of spirit.
p127
aV"I'm\u000anot made of cast-iron, and that's why I can't stand walking all day\u000along.
p128
aVBesides, I have had no dinner."
p129
aV"That isn't my fault, is it?"
p130
aV"I didn't say it was, but it makes me weak for all that."
p131
aV"Well," said Rudolph, "perhaps you're right.
p132
aVI feel like eating\u000asomething myself.
p133
aVWe'll go to some house and ask for supper."
p134
aVTony looked dissatisfied.
p135
aV"I wish we were not obliged to beg our meals," he said; "I don't like\u000ait."
p136
aV"Oh, you're getting proud, are you?"
p137
aVsneered Rudolph.
p138
aV"If you've got\u000amoney to pay for your supper, we won't beg, as you call it."
p139
aV"Why can't we do as other people do?"
p140
aVasked Tony.
p141
aV"What's that?"
p142
aV"Live somewhere, and not go tramping round the country all the time.
p143
aVIt\u000awould be a good deal pleasanter."
p144
aV"Not for me.
p145
aVI'm a vagrant by nature.
p146
aVI can't be cooped up in one\u000aplace.
p147
aVI should die of stagnation.
p148
aVI come of a roving stock.
p149
aVMy mother\u000aand father before me were rovers, and I follow in their steps."
p150
aVThe man spoke with animation, his eye flashing as he gazed about him,\u000aand unconsciously quickened his pace.
p151
aV"Then, I'm not like you," said Tony, decidedly.
p152
aV"I don't want to be a\u000atramp.
p153
aVWere my father and mother rovers like yours?"
p154
aV"Of course they were," answered Rudolph, but not without hesitation.
p155
aV"Ain't I your uncle?"
p156
aV"I don't know.
p157
aVAre you?"
p158
aVreturned Tony, searchingly.
p159
aV"Haven't I told you so a hundred times?"
p160
aVdemanded Rudolph, impatiently.
p161
aV"Yes," said the boy, slowly, "but there's no likeness between us.
p162
aVYou're dark and I am light."
p163
aV"That proves nothing," said the elder tramp, hastily.
p164
aV"Brothers are\u000aoften as unlike.
p165
aVPerhaps you don't want to look upon me as a relation?"
p166
aVThe boy was silent.
p167
aV"Are you getting ashamed of me?"
p168
aVdemanded Rudolph, in a harsh tone.
p169
aV"I am ashamed of myself," said Tony, bitterly.
p170
aV"I'm nothing but\u000aa tramp, begging my bread from door to door, sleeping in barns,\u000aouthouses, in the fields, anywhere I can.
p171
aVI'm as ignorant as a boy of\u000aeight.
p172
aVI can just read and that's all."
p173
aV"You know as much I do."
p174
aV"That don't satisfy me.
p175
aVWhen I grow up I don't want to be----"\u000a\u000aTony hesitated.
p176
aV"You don't want to be like me.
p177
aVIs that it?"
p178
aVasked Rudolph, angrily.
p179
aV"No, I don't want to be like you," answered Tony, boldly.
p180
aV"I want to\u000ahave a home, and a business, and to live like other people."
p181
aV"Humph!"
p182
aVmuttered Rudolph, fixing his eyes thoughtfully upon his young\u000acompanion.
p183
aV"This is something new.
p184
aVYou never talked like that before."
p185
aV"But I've felt like that plenty of times.
p186
aVI'm tired of being a tramp."
p187
aV"Then you're a fool.
p188
aVThere's no life so free and independent.
p189
aVYou can\u000ago where you please, with no one to order you here nor there, the scene\u000achanging always, instead of being obliged to look always upon the same\u000apeople and the same fields."
p190
aV"What's the good of it all?
p191
aVI'm tired of it.
p192
aVI've got no home, and\u000anever had any."
p193
aV"You've got no spirit.
p194
aVYou're only fit for a farm-boy or an apprentice."
p195
aV"I wish I was either one."
p196
aV"Sit down here if you are tired," said the man, abruptly, throwing\u000ahimself down under a wide-spreading tree by the roadside.
p197
aVTony stretched himself out at a little distance, and uttered a sign of\u000arelief as he found himself permitted to rest.
p198
aV"Have you been thinking of this long?"
p199
aVasked Rudolph.
p200
aV"Of what?"
p201
aV"Of not liking to be a tramp?"
p202
aV"Yes."
p203
aV"You have not spoken of it before."
p204
aV"I've been thinking of it more lately."
p205
aV"How did that come?"
p206
aV"I'll tell you," said Tony.
p207
aV"Don't you remember last week when we\u000apassed by a school house?
p208
aVIt was recess, and the boys were out at play.
p209
aVWhile you were away a few minutes, one of the boys sat down by me and\u000atalked.
p210
aVHe told me what he was studying, and what he was going to do\u000awhen he got older, and then he asked me about myself."
p211
aV"What did you tell him?"
p212
aV"What did I tell him?"
p213
aVsaid Tony, bitterly.
p214
aV"I told him that I was a\u000atramp, and that when I got older I should be a tramp still."
p215
aV"Well," said Rudolph, sharply, "what then?"
p216
aV"The boy told me I ought to get some regular work to do, and grow into\u000aa respectable member of society.
p217
aVHe said that his father would help me,\u000ahe thought; and----"\u000a\u000a"So you want to leave me, do you?"
p218
aVdemanded Rudolph, fiercely.
p219
aV"Is that\u000awhat you're coming to, my chicken?"
p220
aV"It isn't that so much as the life you make me lead.
p221
aVI want to leave\u000athat, Rudolph."
p222
aV"Well, you can't do it," said the man, shortly.
p223
aV"Why not?"
p224
aV"I say so, and that's enough."
p225
aVTony was silent for a moment.
p226
aVHe was not greatly disappointed, for he\u000aexpected a refusal.
p227
aVHe changed the subject.
p228
aV"Rudolph," he said, "there's something else I want to ask you about."
p229
aV"Well?"
p230
aV"Who am I?"
p231
aV"Who are you?
p232
aVA young fool," muttered the tramp, but he appeared a\u000alittle uneasy at the question.
p233
aV"I want to know something about my father and mother."
p234
aV"Your mother was my sister.
p235
aVShe died soon after you were born."
p236
aV"And my father?"
p237
aV"He was put in jail for theft, and was shot in trying to make his\u000aescape.
p238
aVDoes that satisfy you?"
p239
aV"No, it doesn't, and what's more, I don't believe it," said Tony,\u000aboldly.
p240
aV"Look here," said Rudolph, sternly.
p241
aV"I've had enough of your insolence.
p242
aVDo you see this strap?"
p243
aVHe produced a long leather strap, which he drew through his fingers\u000amenacingly.
p244
aV"Yes, I see it."
p245
aV"You'll feel it if you ain't careful.
p246
aVNow get up.
p247
aVIt's time to be\u000amoving."
p248
aVCHAPTER II.
p249
aVTHE FARM-HOUSE.
p250
aV"Where are we going to stop to-night?"
p251
aVasked Tony ten minutes later.
p252
aV"There," answered Rudolph, pointing out a farm-house, a little to the\u000aleft.
p253
aV"Suppose they won't let us."
p254
aV"They will admit us into their barn, at least, if we play our cards\u000aright.
p255
aVListen to what I say.
p256
aVYou are to be my son."
p257
aV"But I am not your son."
p258
aV"Be silent!"
p259
aVsaid the other tramp, "and don't you dare to contradict\u000ame.
p260
aVYou have been sick, and are too weak to go farther."
p261
aV"That is a lie, Rudolph."
p262
aV"That doesn't matter.
p263
aVIf they believe it, they won't turn us away.
p264
aVPerhaps they will let you sleep in the house."
p265
aV"Away from you?"
p266
aV"Yes."
p267
aVTony was puzzled.
p268
aVIt seemed as if Rudolph wanted him to be more\u000acomfortably provided for than himself, but the boy knew him too well\u000anot to suspect that there was some concealed motive for this apparent\u000akindness.
p269
aV"Well, what are you thinking about?"
p270
aVdemanded Rudolph, suspiciously, as\u000ahe observed the boy's earnest gaze.
p271
aV"Why do you want me to sleep in the house?"
p272
aVhe asked.
p273
aV"I will tell you.
p274
aVWhen all the family are asleep, I want you to steal\u000adown stairs, open the back door, and let me in."
p275
aV"What for?"
p276
aVasked the boy, startled.
p277
aV"Never you mind.
p278
aVDo as I tell you!"
p279
aV"But I don't want to do it.
p280
aVYou never asked me to do that before."
p281
aV"Didn't I?
p282
aVWell, I had no occasion.
p283
aVI ask you now."
p284
aV"What are you going to do?
p285
aVAre you going to harm any one?"
p286
aV"No.
p287
aVI'll tell you what I'm going to do, but mind you, if you breathe a\u000aword to any being, I'll cut your tongue out."
p288
aVTony looked troubled, but not frightened.
p289
aV"Go on," he said.
p290
aVRudolph continued in a rapid tone.
p291
aV"I want money to carry out a plan of importance.
p292
aVThis farm belongs to a\u000afarmer who is rich, and who keeps a part of his money in the house."
p293
aV"How do you know that?"
p294
aV"A friend of mine stopped there last week, and found out.
p295
aVHe put me on\u000athe scent.
p296
aVThe old man keeps from two to three hundred dollars in his\u000adesk.
p297
aVI must have that money."
p298
aV"I don't want to help you in this, Rudolph," said Tony.
p299
aV"I won't betray\u000ayou, but you mustn't compel me to be a thief."
p300
aV"I can't get along without you, and help me you must."
p301
aV"Suppose we fail?"
p302
aV"Then we must take to our legs.
p303
aVIf we're caught we're both in the same\u000abox.
p304
aVI don't ask you to take any risk that I don't run myself."
p305
aVTony was about to remonstrate further, but it was too late.
p306
aVThey had\u000aalready reached the farm house, and caught sight of the owner standing\u000aunder a tree in the front yard.
p307
aV"Remember!"
p308
aVhissed the older tramp.
p309
aV"Follow my lead, or I'll beat you\u000atill you are half dead.
p310
aVGood evening, sir."
p311
aVThis last was said in a humble tone to the farmer, who advanced to the\u000agate.
p312
aV"Good evening," said the farmer, ingeniously.
p313
aVHe was a man of sixty, roughly dressed to suit his work, with grizzled\u000ahair, a form somewhat bowed, and a face seamed with wrinkles.
p314
aVHe had\u000abeen a hard worker, and showed abundant traces of it in his appearance.
p315
aV"We are very tired and hungry, my boy and I," whined Rudolph.
p316
aV"We've\u000atraveled many miles since morning.
p317
aVWould you kindly give us some supper\u000aand a night's lodging?"
p318
aV"My wife'll give you something to eat," said the old man.
p319
aV"Thank\u000aHeaven!
p320
aVwe've got enough for ourselves and a bit for the poor besides.
p321
aVBut I don't know about lodging.
p322
aVI don't like to take in strangers that\u000aI know nothing about."
p323
aV"I don't blame you, sir," said Rudolph, in a tone of affected humility.
p324
aV"There's many rogues going round the country, I've heard, but I'm a\u000apoor, hardworking man."
p325
aV"Then why are you not at work?"
p326
aV"Times are hard, and I can get nothing to do.
p327
aVI am in search of work.
p328
aVI\u000acan do almost anything.
p329
aVI'm a carpenter by trade."
p330
aVRudolph knew no more of the carpenter's trade than the man in the moon,\u000abut that would do as well as any other.
p331
aV"Where are you from?"
p332
aV"From Buffalo," he answered, with slight hesitation.
p333
aV"Is business dull there?"
p334
aV"Nothing doing."
p335
aV"Well, my friend, you haven't come to the right place.
p336
aVThere's nothing\u000abut farming done here."
p337
aV"I don't know anything about that," said Rudolph, hastily, for he had\u000ano disposition to be set to work in the fields.
p338
aV"I don't need any extra hands," said the farmer.
p339
aV"I am glad of that," thought the tramp.
p340
aV"Go round to the back door, and I will speak to my wife about supper,"\u000asaid the old man.
p341
aV"Come, Tony," said Rudolph, motioning to take the boy's hand, but Tony\u000adid not see fit to notice the movement, and walked in silence by his\u000aside.
p342
aVA motherly-looking old woman made her appearance at the back door.
p343
aV"Come in," she said.
p344
aV"Come right in, and sit down to the table.
p345
aVAbner,\u000amake room for the poor man and his son."
p346
aVAbner was a stalwart youth of eighteen, hard-handed and muscular.
p347
aVHe\u000awas the only permanent "hired man" employed on the farm.
p348
aVIn haying\u000atime there were others transiently employed.
p349
aVA farmer's table is plentiful, though homely.
p350
aVThe two tramps made an\u000aabundant meal, both doing justice to the homely fare.
p351
aVThe farmer's wife\u000alooked on with hospitable satisfaction.
p352
aVShe could not bear to have\u000aanybody hungry under her roof.
p353
aV"You'll excuse our appetite, ma'am," said Rudolph, "but we've had\u000anothing to eat since breakfast."
p354
aV"Eat as much as you like," said she.
p355
aV"We never stint anybody here.
p356
aVIs\u000athat your son?"
p357
aV"Yes, ma'am."
p358
aVTony bent his eyes upon his plate, and frowned slightly.
p359
aVHe wanted to\u000adeny it, but did not dare.
p360
aV"He don't look a bit like you," said the woman.
p361
aV"He's light, and you're\u000avery dark."
p362
aV"His mother was light," said Rudolph.
p363
aV"He takes after her."
p364
aV"How old is he?"
p365
aV"Tony, tell the lady how old you are."
p366
aV"Fourteen."
p367
aV"He is well grown of his age."
p368
aV"Yes; he will make a good-sized man.
p369
aVHe's been sick."
p370
aV"Has he?
p371
aVWhat has been the matter?"
p372
aV"I don't know.
p373
aVPoor folks like us can't call in a doctor."
p374
aV"He don't look sick," said the farmer's wife, thoughtfully.
p375
aV"He's delicate, though he don't look it.
p376
aVIt's sleeping out in the open\u000aair, I expect."
p377
aV"Do you have to sleep out in the open air?"
p378
aV"Yes; we can't afford to pay for lodgings, and people won't take us\u000ainto their houses.
p379
aVI don't mind myself--I'm tough--but Tony can't stand\u000ait as well as I can."
p380
aVWhile this conversation was going on, Tony fixed his eyes upon his\u000aplate.
p381
aVHe was annoyed to have such falsehoods told about him; but if he\u000ashould utter a word of objection he knew there would be an explosion of\u000awrath on the part of his guardian, and he remained silent.
p382
aVThe farmer's wife was a simple-minded, kind-hearted woman, and though\u000aTony did not look at all delicate, she never thought of questioning\u000athe statement of Rudolph.
p383
aVIndeed she was already revolving in her mind\u000ainviting the boy to sleep in the house.
p384
aVShe was rather prejudiced in\u000afavor of Rudolph by his show of parental solicitude.
p385
aVWhen supper was over, having in the meantime consulted her husband, she\u000asaid to Rudolph:\u000a\u000a"My husband says you may sleep in the barn, if you don't smoke.
p386
aVWe can\u000afind a bed for your son with Abner.
p387
aVYou won't mind taking him into your\u000aroom?"
p388
aV"He can come," said Abner, good-naturedly.
p389
aVSo it was arranged.
p390
aVAt half-past eight, for they retired at that early\u000ahour in the farm house, Rudolph left the fireside, and sought the barn.
p391
aVAs he left the room he looked suspiciously at Tony, and shook his head\u000awarningly.
p392
aVCHAPTER III.
p393
aVRUDOLPH'S DISAPPOINTMENT.
p394
aVAbner slept in a large room in the attic.
p395
aVIt had been roughly\u000apartitioned off, and was not even plastered.
p396
aVThe beams were plainly\u000avisible.
p397
aVUpon nails which had been driven into them hung Abner's\u000alimited wardrobe.
p398
aVThere were two cot-beds in the room, as a part of the\u000ayear the farmer employed more than one hired man.
p399
aV"You can sleep there, youngster," said Abner, pointing to one of the\u000abeds.
p400
aV"This is my bed."
p401
aV"Thank you," said Tony, politely.
p402
aV"I s'pose you've traveled round considerable," said Abner, with\u000acuriosity.
p403
aV"Yes, a good deal."
p404
aV"Do you like it?"
p405
aV"No; I'm tired of it."
p406
aV"How do you make your livin'?"
p407
aV"As we can.
p408
aVWe often go hungry."
p409
aV"Why don't your father settle down somewhere?"
p410
aVTony thought of disclaiming the relationship implied, but he reflected\u000athat Rudolph would be angry, and merely answered:\u000a\u000a"He prefers to travel round."
p411
aV"Was you ever in New York?"
p412
aVasked Abner.
p413
aV"Do you mean the city of New York?
p414
aVYes."
p415
aV"I'd like to see it," said Abner, regarding Tony with new respect.
p416
aV"I've heard a sight about it.
p417
aVIt's powerful big, isn't it?"
p418
aV"It's very large."
p419
aV"There's as many as a thousand houses, isn't there?"
p420
aV"There's a hundred thousand, I should think," answered Tony.
p421
aV"Sho?
p422
aVyou don't say so!"
p423
aVexclaimed Abner, awestruck.
p424
aV"I'd like to go\u000athere."
p425
aV"Didn't you ever visit the city?"
p426
aV"No; I never traveled any.
p427
aVI never was more'n fifteen miles from home.
p428
aVDad wouldn't let me.
p429
aVWhen I'm a man, I'm bound to see the world."
p430
aV"Ain't you a man now?"
p431
aVinquired Tony, surveying his Herculean\u000aproportions with astonishment.
p432
aV"No; I'm only eighteen."
p433
aV"You're as big as a man."
p434
aV"Yes, I'm pooty big," said Abner, with a complacent grin.
p435
aV"I can do a\u000aman's work."
p436
aV"I should think you might.
p437
aVI thought you were more than four years\u000aolder than me.
p438
aVI'm fourteen."
p439
aV"I guess I weigh twice as much as you."
p440
aV"I'm not small of my age," said Tony, jealously.
p441
aV"Maybe not.
p442
aVI'm a regular bouncer.
p443
aVThat's what dad says.
p444
aVWhy, I'm half\u000aas big again as he is."
p445
aV"Does he ever lick you?"
p446
aVasked Tony, smiling.
p447
aV"I'd like to see him try it," said Abner, bursting into a roar of\u000alaughter.
p448
aV"He'd have to get upon a milkin' stool.
p449
aVDoes your dad lick\u000ayou?"
p450
aV"No," answered Tony, shortly.
p451
aV"He looks as if he might sometimes.
p452
aVHe's kinder fractious-looking."
p453
aVTony did not care to say much on the subject of Rudolph.
p454
aVHe felt that\u000ait was his policy to be silent.
p455
aVIf he said anything he might say too\u000amuch, and if it got to Rudolph's ears, the man's vindictive temper\u000awould make it dangerous for him.
p456
aV"We get along pretty well," he said, guardedly.
p457
aV"Do you get up early?"
p458
aV"Four o'clock.
p459
aVYou won't have to, though."
p460
aV"What time do you get breakfast?"
p461
aV"Half-past five, after I've milked and done the chores.
p462
aVYou must be up\u000aby that time, or you won't get anything to eat."
p463
aV"That's pretty early," thought Tony.
p464
aV"I don't see the use of getting up\u000aso early."
p465
aV"I guess I'll go to sleep," said Abner.
p466
aV"I'm tuckered out."
p467
aV"Good-night, then," said Tony.
p468
aV"Good-night."
p469
aVThe young giant turned over, closed his eyes, and in five minutes was\u000aasleep.
p470
aVTony did not compose himself to sleep so readily, partly because Abner\u000abegan to snore in a boisterous manner, partly because he felt disturbed\u000aby the thought of the treachery which Rudolph required at his hands.
p471
aVTony was only a tramp, but he had an instinct of honor in him.
p472
aVIn the\u000afarm house he had been kindly treated and hospitably entertained.
p473
aVHe\u000afelt that it would be very mean to steal down in the dead of night\u000aand open the door to his companion in order that he might rob the\u000aunsuspecting farmer of his money.
p474
aVOn the other hand, if he did not do\u000athis, he knew that he would be severely beaten by Rudolph.
p475
aV"Why am I tied to this man?"
p476
aVhe thought.
p477
aV"What chance is there of my\u000aever being anything but a tramp while I stay with him?"
p478
aVHe had thought this before now, but the circumstances in which he now\u000afound himself placed made the feeling stronger.
p479
aVHe had been often\u000ahumiliated by being forced to beg from door to door, by the thought\u000athat he was a vagrant, and the companion of a vagrant, but he had not\u000abeen urged to actual crime until now.
p480
aVHe knew enough to be aware that\u000ahe ran the risk of arrest and imprisonment if he obeyed Rudolph.
p481
aVOn the\u000aother hand, if he refused, he was sure of a beating.
p482
aVWhat should he do?
p483
aVIt was certainly a difficult question to decide, and Tony debated it in\u000ahis own mind for some time.
p484
aVFinally he came to a determination.
p485
aVRudolph\u000amight beat him, but he would not be guilty of this treachery.
p486
aVHe felt better after he had come to this resolve, and the burden being\u000anow off his mind, he composed himself to sleep.
p487
aVHe did not know how long he slept, but he had a troubled dream.
p488
aVHe\u000athought that in compliance with his companion's order he rose and\u000aopened the door to him.
p489
aVWhile Rudolph was opening the farmer's desk,\u000ahe thought that heavy steps were heard, and Abner and the farmer\u000aentered the room, provided with a lantern.
p490
aVHe thought that Rudolph and\u000ahimself were overpowered and bound.
p491
aVJust as he reached this part he\u000aawaked, and was reassured by hearing Abner's heavy breathing.
p492
aV"I'm glad it's a dream," he thought, breathing a sigh of relief.
p493
aVAt this instant his attention was called by a noise upon the panes of\u000athe only window in the room.
p494
aVHe listened, and detected the cause.
p495
aVSome one was throwing gravel stones against it.
p496
aV"It's Rudolph!"
p497
aVhe thought instantly.
p498
aV"He's trying to call my\u000aattention."
p499
aVHe thought of pretending to be asleep, and taking no notice of the\u000asignal.
p500
aVBut he feared Abner would awake, and ascertain the meaning of\u000ait.
p501
aVHe decided to go to the window, show himself, and stop the noise if\u000ahe could.
p502
aVHe rose from his bed, and presented himself at the window.
p503
aVLooking\u000adown, he saw the dark figure of Rudolph leaning against the well-curb,\u000awith his eyes fixed on the window.
p504
aV"Oh, you're there at last," growled Rudolph.
p505
aV"I thought I'd never wake\u000ayou up.
p506
aVIs the man asleep?"
p507
aV"Yes," said Tony.
p508
aV"Then come down and let me in."
p509
aV"I would rather not," said Tony, uneasily.
p510
aV"What's the fool afraid of?"
p511
aVanswered Rudolph, in a low, menacing tone.
p512
aV"The man might wake up."
p513
aV"No danger.
p514
aVSuch animals always sleep heavily.
p515
aVThere's no danger, I\u000atell you."
p516
aV"I don't want to do it," said Tony.
p517
aV"It would be mean.
p518
aVThey've treated\u000ame well, and I don't want to help rob them."
p519
aV"Curse the young idiot!"
p520
aVexclaimed Rudolph, in low tones of\u000aconcentrated passion.
p521
aV"Do you mean to disobey me?"
p522
aV"I can't do as you wish, Rudolph.
p523
aVAsk me anything else."
p524
aV"I wish I could get at him!"
p525
aVmuttered Rudolph, between his teeth.
p526
aV"He\u000anever dared to disobey me before.
p527
aVOnce more!
p528
aVWill you open the door to\u000ame?"
p529
aVdemanded Rudolph.
p530
aVTony bethought himself of an expedient.
p531
aVHe might pretend that Abner was\u000awaking up.
p532
aV"Hush!"
p533
aVhe said, in feigned alarm.
p534
aV"The man is waking up.
p535
aVGet out of\u000asight quick."
p536
aVHe disappeared from the window, and Rudolph, supposing there was really\u000adanger of detection, hurriedly stole away to the barn where he had been\u000apermitted to lodge.
p537
aVHe came out half an hour later, and again made the old signal, but this\u000atime Tony did not show himself.
p538
aVHe had made up his mind not to comply\u000awith the elder tramp's demands, and it would do no good to argue the\u000apoint.
p539
aV"I wish I knew whether he was asleep, or only pretending, the young\u000arascal," muttered Rudolph.
p540
aV"I must manage to have him stay here another\u000anight.
p541
aVThat money must and shall be mine, and he shall help to get it\u000afor me."
p542
aVCHAPTER IV.
p543
aVSETTING A TRAP.
p544
aVAt half-past five Tony got up.
p545
aVHe would have liked to remain in bed\u000atwo hours longer, but there was no chance for late resting at the farm\u000ahouse.
p546
aVRudolph, too, was awakened by Abner, and the two tramps took\u000atheir seats at the breakfast table with the rest of the family.
p547
aVRudolph furtively scowled at Tony.
p548
aVTo him he attributed the failure of\u000ahis plans the night before, and he was furious against him--the more so\u000athat he did not dare to say anything in presence of the farmer's family.
p549
aV"Where are you going to-day?"
p550
aVasked the farmer, addressing Rudolph.
p551
aV"I am going to walk to Crampton.
p552
aVI may get employment there."
p553
aV"It is twelve miles away.
p554
aVThat's a good walk."
p555
aV"I don't mind it for myself.
p556
aVI mind it for my son," said Rudolph,\u000ahypocritically.
p557
aV"He can stay here till you come back," said the farmer, hospitably.
p558
aV"If you're willing to have him, I will leave him for one more night,"\u000asaid Rudolph.
p559
aV"It'll do him good to rest."
p560
aV"He can stay as well as not," said the farmer.
p561
aV"When are you coming\u000aback?"
p562
aV"Perhaps to-night, but I think not till to-morrow."
p563
aV"Don't trouble yourself about your son.
p564
aVHe will be safe here."
p565
aV"You are very kind," said the elder tramp.
p566
aV"Tony, thank these good\u000apeople for their kindness to you."
p567
aV"I do thank them," said Tony, glancing uneasily at the other.
p568
aVWhen breakfast was over, Rudolph took his hat, and said:\u000a\u000a"I'll get started early.
p569
aVI've a long walk before me."
p570
aVTony sat still, hoping that he would not be called upon to join him.
p571
aVBut he was destined to be disappointed.
p572
aV"Come and walk a piece with me, Tony," said Rudolph.
p573
aVReluctantly Tony got his hat, and set out with him.
p574
aVAs long as they were in sight and hearing, Rudolph spoke to him gently,\u000abut when they were far enough for him to throw off the mask safely, he\u000aturned furiously upon the boy.
p575
aV"Now, you young rascal," he said, roughly, "tell me why you didn't obey\u000ame last night."
p576
aV"It wasn't safe," said Tony.
p577
aV"We should both have been caught."
p578
aV"Why should we?
p579
aVWasn't the man asleep?"
p580
aV"He stirred in his sleep.
p581
aVIf I had moved about much, or opened the\u000adoor, it would have waked him up."
p582
aV"You are a coward," sneered Rudolph.
p583
aV"When I was of your age, I\u000awouldn't have given up a job so easily.
p584
aVSuch men sleep sound.
p585
aVNo matter\u000aif they do move about, they won't wake up.
p586
aVIf you had had a little more\u000acourage, we should have succeeded last night in capturing the money."
p587
aV"I wish you'd give it up, Rudolph," said Tony, earnestly.
p588
aV"You don't know what you're talking about," said the tramp, harshly.
p589
aV"You're a milksop.
p590
aVThe world owes us a living, and we must call for it."
p591
aV"I'd rather work than steal."
p592
aV"There's no work to be had, and we must have money.
p593
aVMore depends on it\u000athan you think.
p594
aVBut we've got one more night to work in."
p595
aV"What do you mean to do?"
p596
aVasked Tony, uneasily.
p597
aV"Thanks to my management, you will sleep in the same room to-night.
p598
aVLook round the house during the day; see if the key's in the desk.
p599
aVIf\u000ayou can get hold of the money, all the better.
p600
aVIn that case, come and\u000ahide it in that hollow tree, and we can secure it after the hue and cry\u000ais over.
p601
aVDo you hear?"
p602
aV"Yes."
p603
aV"But, if there is no chance of that, look out for me at midnight.
p604
aVI\u000awill throw gravel against your window as a signal.
p605
aVWhen you hear it,\u000asteal down stairs, with your shoes in your hands, and open the door to\u000ame.
p606
aVI will attend to the rest.
p607
aVAnd mind," he added, sternly, "I shall\u000atake no excuses."
p608
aV"Suppose I am caught going down stairs?"
p609
aV"Say you are taken sick.
p610
aVIt will be easy enough to make an excuse."
p611
aV"Are you going to Crampton?"
p612
aVasked Tony.
p613
aV"Of course not.
p614
aVDo you think I am such a fool as to take a long walk\u000alike that?"
p615
aV"You said you were going."
p616
aV"Only to put them off the scent.
p617
aVI shall hide in yonder wood till\u000anight.
p618
aVThen I will find my way back to the farmhouse."
p619
aV"Do you want me to go any farther with you?"
p620
aV"No; you can go back now if you want to.
p621
aVDon't forget my directions."
p622
aV"I will remember them," said Tony, quietly.
p623
aVThe two parted company, and Tony walked slowly back to the farm.
p624
aVHe was\u000atroubled and perplexed.
p625
aVHe was in a dilemma, and how to get out of it\u000ahe did not know.
p626
aVIt was not the first time that he thought over his relations to Rudolph.
p627
aVAs far back as he could remember he had been under the care of this\u000aman.
p628
aVSometimes the latter had been away for months, leaving him in\u000athe charge of a woman whose appearance indicated that she also was\u000aof Gipsy descent.
p629
aVHe had experienced hunger, cold, neglect, but had\u000alived through them all, tolerably contented.
p630
aVNow, however, he saw that\u000aRudolph intended to make a criminal of him, and he was disposed to\u000arebel.
p631
aVThat his guardian was himself a thief, he had reason to know.
p632
aVHe\u000asuspected that some of his periodical absences were spent in prison\u000awalls.
p633
aVWould he be content to follow his example?
p634
aVTony answered unhesitatingly, "No."
p635
aVWhatever the consequences might be,\u000ahe would make a stand there.
p636
aVHe had reason to fear violence, but that\u000awas better than arrest and imprisonment.
p637
aVIf matters came to the worst,\u000ahe would run away.
p638
aVWhen he had come to a decision he felt better.
p639
aVHe returned to the farm\u000aand found Abner just leaving the yard with a hoe in his hand.
p640
aV"Where are you going?"
p641
aVhe asked.
p642
aV"To the corn field."
p643
aV"May I go with you?"
p644
aV"If you want to."
p645
aVSo Tony went out to the field with the stalwart "hired man," and kept\u000ahim company through the forenoon.
p646
aV"That's easy work," said Tony, after a while.
p647
aV"Do you think you can do it?"
p648
aV"Let me try."
p649
aVTony succeeded tolerably well, but he could not get over the ground so\u000afast as Abner.
p650
aV"Why don't you hire out on a farm?"
p651
aVasked Abner, as he took back the\u000ahoe.
p652
aV"I would if I could," answered Tony.
p653
aV"Why can't you?
p654
aVWon't your father let you?"
p655
aV"He wants me to go round with him," answered Tony.
p656
aV"Wouldn't he take me instead of you?"
p657
aVasked Abner, grinning.
p658
aV"I'd like\u000ato travel round and see the world.
p659
aVYou could stay here and do farm\u000awork."
p660
aV"If he and the farmer agree to the change, I will," answered Tony, with\u000aa smile.
p661
aVAt noon they went back to the farm house to dinner.
p662
aVTony stared with\u000aastonishment at the quantity of food Abner made away with.
p663
aVHe concluded\u000athat farm work was favorable to the appetite.
p664
aVThe afternoon passed rapidly away, and night came.
p665
aVAgain Tony went up\u000ainto the attic to share Abner's room.
p666
aVHe got nervous as the night wore\u000aon.
p667
aVHe knew what was expected of him, and he shrank from Rudolph's\u000aanger.
p668
aVHe tried to go to sleep, but could not.
p669
aVAt last the expected signal came.
p670
aVThere was a rattling of gravel stones\u000aupon the window.
p671
aV"Shall I lie here and take no notice?"
p672
aVthought Tony.
p673
aVIn this case Rudolph would continue to fling gravel stones, and\u000aAbner might wake up.
p674
aVHe decided to go to the window and announce his\u000adetermination.
p675
aVWhen Rudolph saw him appear at the window, he called out:\u000a\u000a"Come down quick, and open the door."
p676
aV"I would rather not," answered Tony.
p677
aV"You must!"
p678
aVexclaimed Rudolph, with a terrible oath.
p679
aV"If you dare to\u000arefuse, I'll flay you alive."
p680
aV"I can't do it," said Tony, pale but resolute.
p681
aV"You have no right to\u000aask it of me."
p682
aVJust then Tony was startled by a voice from the bed:\u000a\u000a"Is that your father?
p683
aVWhat does he want?"
p684
aV"I would rather not tell," said Tony.
p685
aV"You must!"
p686
aVsaid Abner, sternly.
p687
aV"He wants me to open the door and let him into the house," Tony\u000aconfessed, reluctantly.
p688
aV"What for?"
p689
aV"He wants to get your master's money."
p690
aV"Ho, ho!"
p691
aVsaid Abner.
p692
aV"Well, we'll go down and let him in."
p693
aV"What!"
p694
aVexclaimed Tony, in surprise.
p695
aV"Call from the window that you will be down directly."
p696
aV"I don't want to get him into trouble."
p697
aV"You must, or I shall think you are a thief, too."
p698
aVThus constrained, Tony called out that he would come down at once.
p699
aV"I thought you'd think better of it," muttered Rudolph.
p700
aV"Hurry down,\u000aand waste no time."
p701
aVFive minutes later, Abner and Tony crept down stairs, the former armed\u000awith a tough oak stick.
p702
aVCHAPTER V.\u000a\u000aAN ATTEMPT AT BURGLARY.
p703
aVUnsuspicious of danger, Rudolph took a position on the door-step.
p704
aVHe was incensed with Tony for having given him so much unnecessary\u000atrouble, and he was resolved to give the boy a lesson.
p705
aVIt was quite dark in the shadow of the house, and when the door opened,\u000aRudolph, supposing, of course, it was Tony who had opened it, seized\u000athe person, whom he saw but dimly, by the arm, exclaiming venomously,\u000aas he tried to reach him:\u000a\u000a"I'll teach you to keep me waiting, you young rascal."
p706
aVHe was not long in finding out his mistake.
p707
aVAbner was considerably larger and more muscular than the tramp, and he\u000areturned the compliment by shaking off Rudolph's grasp, and seizing him\u000ain his own vise-like grasp.
p708
aV"You'll teach me, will you, you villain," retorted Abner.
p709
aV"I'll teach\u000ayou to come here like a thief."
p710
aV"Let go," exclaimed the tramp, as he felt himself shaken roughly.
p711
aV"Not till I've given you a good drubbing," returned Abner, and he began\u000ato use his cudgel with effect on the back and shoulders of the tramp.
p712
aV"You've come to the wrong house, you have."
p713
aVRudolph ground his teeth with ineffectual rage.
p714
aVHe lamented that he\u000ahad not a knife or pistol with him, but he had made so sure of easy\u000aentrance into the house, and no resistance, that he had not prepared\u000ahimself.
p715
aVAs to brute force, he was no match for Abner.
p716
aV"The boy betrayed me!"
p717
aVhe shrieked.
p718
aV"I'll have his life."
p719
aV"Not much," said Abner.
p720
aV"You'll be lucky to get away with your own.
p721
aVIt\u000aisn't the boy.
p722
aVI was awake, and heard you ask him to let you in.
p723
aVNow\u000atake yourself off."
p724
aVAs he said this he gave a powerful push, and Rudolph reeled a moment\u000aand sank upon the ground, striking his head with violence.
p725
aV"He won't try it again," said Abner, as he shut to the door and bolted\u000ait.
p726
aV"I guess he's got enough for once."
p727
aVTony stood by, ashamed and mortified.
p728
aVHe was afraid Abner would class\u000ahim with the tramp who had just been ignominiously expelled from the\u000ahouse.
p729
aVHe was afraid he, too, would be thrust out of doors, in which\u000acase he would be exposed to brutal treatment from Rudolph.
p730
aVBut he\u000adid not need to fear this.
p731
aVAbner had seen and heard enough to feel\u000aconvinced that Tony was all right in the matter, and he did not mean to\u000amake the innocent suffer for the guilty.
p732
aV"Now let us go to bed, Tony," he said in a friendly manner.
p733
aV"You don't\u000awant to go with him, do you?"
p734
aV"No," said Tony.
p735
aV"I never want to see him again."
p736
aV"I shouldn't think you would.
p737
aVHe's a rascal and a thief."
p738
aV"I hope you don't think I wanted to rob the house," said Tony.
p739
aV"No; I don't believe you're a bit like him; what makes you go with him?"
p740
aV"I won't any more."
p741
aV"He isn't your father?"
p742
aV"No; I don't know who my father is."
p743
aV"That's strange," said Abner, who had seen but little of the world.
p744
aVEvery one that he knew had a father, and knew who that father was.
p745
aVHe\u000acould not realize that any one could have an experience like Tony's.
p746
aV"I wish I did know my father," said Tony, thoughtfully.
p747
aV"I'm alone in\u000athe world now."
p748
aV"What do you mean to do?"
p749
aV"I'll go off by myself to-morrow, away from Rudolph.
p750
aVI never want to\u000asee him again."
p751
aV"Have you got any money?"
p752
aVThey had now got back into the chamber, and were taking off their\u000aclothes.
p753
aV"I've got five cents," answered Tony.
p754
aV"Is that all?"
p755
aV"Yes; but I don't mind; I'll get along somehow."
p756
aVTony had always got along somehow.
p757
aVHe had never--at least not for long\u000aat a time--known what it was to have a settled home or a permanent\u000ashelter.
p758
aVWhether the world owed him a living or not, he had always got\u000aone, such as it was, and though he had often been cold and hungry,\u000ahere he was at fourteen; well and strong, and with plenty of pluck\u000aand courage to carry with him into the life struggle that was opening\u000abefore him.
p759
aVAbner's training had been different, and he wondered at the\u000acoolness with which Tony contemplated the future.
p760
aVBut he was too sleepy\u000ato wonder long at anything, and with a yawn he lapsed into slumber.
p761
aVTony did not go to sleep immediately.
p762
aVHe had need to be thoughtful.
p763
aVHe had made up his mind to be his own master henceforth, but Rudolph,\u000ahe knew, would have a word to say on that point.
p764
aVIn getting away\u000athe next morning he must manage to give the tramp a wide berth.
p765
aVIt\u000awould be better for him to go to some distant place, where, free from\u000ainterference, he could make his own living.
p766
aVThere was another thought that came to him.
p767
aVSomewhere in the world he\u000amight come across a father or mother, or more distant relative--one of\u000awhom he would not be ashamed, as he was of the companion who tried to\u000adraw him into crime.
p768
aVThis was the last thought in his mind, as he sank\u000ainto a sound sleep from which he did not awaken till he was called to\u000abreakfast.
p769
aVCHAPTER VI.
p770
aVABNER'S RUSE.
p771
aVTo say that Rudolph was angry when he recovered from the temporary\u000ainsensibility occasioned by his fall, would be a very mild expression.
p772
aVHe had not only been thwarted in his designs, but suffered violence and\u000ahumiliation in presence of the boy of whom he regarded himself as the\u000aguardian.
p773
aVHe thirsted for revenge, if not on Abner, then on Tony, whom\u000ait would be safer to maltreat and abuse.
p774
aVAnger is unreasonable, and poor Tony would have fared badly, if he had\u000afallen into Rudolph's clutches just then.
p775
aVIt made no difference that\u000aAbner had exonerated Tony from any share in the unpleasant surprise he\u000ahad met.
p776
aVHe determined to give him a severe beating, nevertheless.
p777
aVThere is an old proverb: "You must catch your hare before you cook it."
p778
aVThis did not occur to the tramp.
p779
aVHe never supposed Tony would have the\u000ahardihood or courage to give him the slip.
p780
aVThe remainder of the night spent by Tony in sleeping was less\u000apleasantly spent by Rudolph in the barn.
p781
aVHe meant to be up early, as he knew he was liable to arrest on account\u000aof his last night's attempt, and lie in wait for Tony, who, he\u000asupposed, would wait for breakfast.
p782
aVHe was right there.
p783
aVTony did remain for breakfast.
p784
aVThe farmer--Mr.\u000aColeman--had already been informed of Rudolph's attempted burglary, and\u000ahe did Tony the justice to exonerate him from any share in it.
p785
aV"What are you going to do, my boy?"
p786
aVhe asked at the breakfast table.
p787
aV"I am going to set up for myself," answered Tony, cheerfully.
p788
aV"That's right.
p789
aVHave nothing more to do with that man.
p790
aVHe can only do\u000ayou harm.
p791
aVHave you got any money?"
p792
aV"I've got five cents."
p793
aV"That isn't enough to buy a farm."
p794
aV"Not a very large one," said Tony, smiling.
p795
aVAbner nearly choked with laughter.
p796
aVThis was a joke which he could\u000aappreciate.
p797
aV"I don't think I'll go to farming," continued Tony.
p798
aV"You can stay here a week or two," said the farmer, hospitably, "till\u000ayou get time to look round."
p799
aV"Thank you," said Tony.
p800
aV"You are very kind, but I don't think it will\u000abe safe.
p801
aVRudolph will be on the watch for me."
p802
aV"The man you came with?"
p803
aV"Yes."
p804
aV"Guess he won't touch you while I'm round," said Abner.
p805
aV"I don't think he'll want to tackle you again," said Tony.
p806
aV"Didn't I lay him out though?"
p807
aVsaid Abner, with a grin.
p808
aV"He thought it\u000awas you, ho!
p809
aVho!"
p810
aV"He didn't think so long," said Tony.
p811
aV"I haven't got such an arm as\u000ayou."
p812
aVAbner was pleased with this compliment to his prowess, and wouldn't\u000ahave minded another tussle with the tramp.
p813
aV"Where do you think that chap you call Rudolph is?"
p814
aVhe asked.
p815
aV"He's searching for me, I expect," said Tony.
p816
aV"If I'm not careful he'll\u000aget hold of me."
p817
aVJust then a neighbor's boy, named Joe, came to the house on an errand.
p818
aVHe was almost Tony's size.
p819
aVHe waited about, not seeming in any hurry to\u000abe gone.
p820
aV"Abner," said the farmer, "if you've got nothing else to do, you may\u000aload up the wagon with hay, and carry it to Castleton.
p821
aVWe shall have\u000amore than we want."
p822
aV"All right," said Abner.
p823
aV"May I go, too?
p824
aVMay I ride on the hay?"
p825
aVasked Joe, eagerly.
p826
aV"Will your father let you?"
p827
aVasked the farmer.
p828
aV"Oh, yes; he won't mind."
p829
aV"Then you may go," was the reply.
p830
aV"Do you want to go, too, Tony?"
p831
aVTony was about to say yes, when an idea seized him.
p832
aV"If the other boy goes, Rudolph will think it is I, and he will follow\u000athe wagon.
p833
aVThat will give me a chance of getting off in another\u000adirection."
p834
aV"So it will," said Abner.
p835
aV"What a head-piece you've got," he added,\u000aadmiringly.
p836
aV"I wouldn't have thought of that."
p837
aVAbner's head-piece was nothing to boast of.
p838
aVHe had strength of body,\u000abut to equalize matters his mind was not equally endowed.
p839
aVThe plan was disclosed to Joe, who willingly agreed to enter into it.
p840
aVThis was the more feasible because he was of about Tony's size, and\u000awore a hat just like his.
p841
aVThe hay was loaded, and the wagon started off with Abner walking\u000aalongside.
p842
aVJoe was perched on top, nearly buried in the hay, but with\u000ahis hat rising from the mass.
p843
aVThis was about all that could be seen of\u000ahim.
p844
aVThey had gone about half a mile when from the bushes by the roadside\u000aRudolph emerged.
p845
aVHe had seen the hat, and felt sure that Tony was\u000atrying to escape him in this way.
p846
aV"Well," said Abner, with a grin, as he recognized his midnight foe,\u000a"how do you feel this morning?"
p847
aV"None the better for you, curse you!"
p848
aVreturned the tramp, roughly.
p849
aVAbner laughed.
p850
aV"That's what I thought," he said, cracking his whip.
p851
aVRudolph would like to have punished him then and there for his\u000ahumiliation of the night before, but Abner looked too powerful as he\u000astrode along manfully with vigorous steps.
p852
aVBesides, he had a heavy whip\u000ain his hand, which the tramp suspected would be used unhesitatingly if\u000athere were occasion.
p853
aVThe prospect was not inviting.
p854
aVBut, at any rate,\u000aRudolph could demand that Tony be remitted to his custody.
p855
aV"Where's my boy?"
p856
aVasked the tramp, keeping at a safe distance.
p857
aV"Didn't know you had a boy," said Abner.
p858
aV"I mean that villain Tony.
p859
aVIs that he on the load of hay?"
p860
aV"Kinder looks like him," answered Abner, grinning.
p861
aVRudolph looked up and caught sight of the hat.
p862
aV"Come down here, Tony," he said sternly.
p863
aVJoe, who had been instructed what to do, answered not a word.
p864
aV"Come down here, if you know what's best for you," continued the tramp.
p865
aV"Guess he's hard of hearing," laughed Abner.
p866
aV"Stop your wagon," said Rudolph, furiously; "I want to get hold of him."
p867
aV"Couldn't do it," said Abner, coolly.
p868
aV"I'm in a hurry."
p869
aV"Will you give me the boy or not?"
p870
aVdemanded the tramp, hoarsely.
p871
aV"He can get off and go along with you if he wants to," said Abner.
p872
aV"Do\u000ayou want to get down, Tony?"
p873
aV"No!"
p874
aVanswered the supposed Tony.
p875
aV"You see, squire, he prefers to ride," said Abner.
p876
aV"Can't blame him\u000amuch.
p877
aVI'd do it in his place."
p878
aV"Where are you going?"
p879
aVdemanded the tramp, who hadn't discovered that\u000athe voice was not that of Tony.
p880
aV"I'm going to Castleton," answered Abner.
p881
aV"Are you going to leave the hay there?"
p882
aV"Yes, that's what I calc'late to do."
p883
aV"How far is it?"
p884
aV"Six miles."
p885
aV"I'll walk along, too."
p886
aV"Better not, squire, you'll get tired."
p887
aV"I'll risk that."
p888
aVOf course Rudolph's plan was manifest.
p889
aVWhen the hay was unloaded, of\u000acourse Tony would have to get down.
p890
aVThen he would get hold of him.
p891
aV"You can do just as you've a mind to," said Abner.
p892
aV"You'll be company\u000ato Tony and me, but you needn't put yourself out on our account, hey,\u000aTony?"
p893
aVThere was a smothered laugh on top of the hay, which the tramp heard.
p894
aVHis eyes snapped viciously, and he privately determined to give Tony a\u000asettlement in full for all his offenses just as soon as he got hold of\u000ahim.
p895
aVSo they jogged on, mile after mile.
p896
aVAbner walked on one side, swinging\u000ahis whip, and occasionally cracking it.
p897
aVThe tramp walked on the other\u000aside of the road, and the boy rode along luxuriously embedded in his\u000afragrant couch of hay.
p898
aVAbner from time to time kept up the tramp's\u000aillusions by calling out, "Tony, you must take keer, or you'll fall\u000aoff."
p899
aV"I'll catch him if he does," said Rudolph, grimly.
p900
aV"So you will," chuckled Abner.
p901
aV"You'd like to, wouldn't you?"
p902
aV"Certainly.
p903
aVHe is my son," said Rudolph.
p904
aV"Do you hear that, Tony?
p905
aVHe says you're his son," said Abner, grinning\u000aagain.
p906
aVThere was another laugh from the boy on the load of hay.
p907
aV"You won't find anything to laugh at when I get hold of you," muttered\u000aRudolph.
p908
aVSo they rode into Castleton.
p909
aVFrom time to time Abner, as he thought how neatly the tramp had been\u000asold, burst into a loud laugh, which was echoed from the hay wagon.
p910
aVRudolph was not only angry, but puzzled.
p911
aV"Does the boy hope to escape me?"
p912
aVhe asked himself.
p913
aV"If so, he will\u000afind himself badly mistaken.
p914
aVHe will find that I am not to be trifled\u000awith."
p915
aV"Say, squire, what makes you look so glum?"
p916
aVasked Abner.
p917
aV"Maybe it's\u000abecause I didn't let you in when you called so late last night.
p918
aVWe\u000adon't receive visitors after midnight."
p919
aVRudolph scowled, but said nothing.
p920
aV"How long has the boy been with you?"
p921
aVasked Abner, further.
p922
aV"Since he was born," answered the tramp.
p923
aV"Ain't I his father?"
p924
aV"I don't know.
p925
aVIf it's a conundrum I give it up."
p926
aV"Well, I am, and no one has a right to keep him from me," said the\u000atramp, in a surly manner.
p927
aV"I wouldn't keep him from you for a minute," said Abner, innocently.
p928
aV"You are doing it now."
p929
aV"No, I ain't."
p930
aV"I can't get at him on that hay."
p931
aV"He can come down if he wants to.
p932
aVI don't stop him.
p933
aVYou can come down\u000aif you want to, Tony," he said, looking up to where the boy's hat was\u000avisible.
p934
aVTony did not answer, and Abner continued:\u000a\u000a"You see he don't want to come.
p935
aVHe'd rather ride.
p936
aVYou know he's been\u000asick," said Abner, with a grin, "and he's too delicate to walk.
p937
aVHe\u000aain't tough, like you and me."
p938
aV"He'll need to be tough," muttered the tramp, as he thought of the\u000aflogging he intended to give Tony.
p939
aV"What did you say?"
p940
aV"Never mind."
p941
aV"Oh, I don't mind," said Abner.
p942
aV"You can say what you want to.
p943
aVThis is\u000aa free country, only you can't do what you've a mind to."
p944
aVRudolph wished that he had a double stock of strength.
p945
aVIt was very\u000aprovoking to be laughed at and derided by Abner without being able\u000ato revenge himself.
p946
aVA pistol or a knife would make him even with the\u000acountryman, but Rudolph was too much of a coward to commit such serious\u000acrimes when there was so much danger of detection and punishment.
p947
aVAt last they entered Castleton.
p948
aVThe hay was to be delivered to a speculator, who collected large\u000aquantities of it, and forwarded over the railroad to a large city.
p949
aVIt had to be weighed, and Abner drove at once to the hay scales.
p950
aV"Now," thought Rudolph, with exultation, "the boy must come down, and I\u000ashall get hold of him."
p951
aV"I guess you'd better slide down," said Abner.
p952
aV"I can't sell you for\u000ahay, Tony."
p953
aVThere was a movement, and then the boy slid down, Abner catching him as\u000ahe descended.
p954
aVRudolph's face changed ominously when he saw that it wasn't Tony who\u000amade his appearance.
p955
aV"What does this mean?"
p956
aVhe demanded furiously.
p957
aV"What's the matter?"
p958
aV"This isn't Tony."
p959
aV"Come to look at him, it isn't," said Abner, with a twinkle in his eye.
p960
aV"Didn't you say it was Tony?"
p961
aVasked the tramp, exasperated.
p962
aV"I guess I was mistaken, squire," said Abner, grinning.
p963
aV"Where is he?"
p964
aV"I don't know, I'm sure.
p965
aVIt seems he didn't come.
p966
aVGuess he must have\u000agiven us the slip."
p967
aVThe tramp, unable to control his rage, burst into a volley of\u000aexecrations.
p968
aV"Hope you feel better, squire," said Abner, when he got through.
p969
aVThe tramp strode off, vowing dire vengeance against both Abner and\u000aTony.
p970
aV[Illustration: "What does this mean?"
p971
aVdemanded the tramp furiously.
p972
aV"This isn't Tony."

p974
aVCHAPTER VII.
p975
aVA STRANGE HOTEL.
p976
aVFrom the upper window in the farm house, which was situated on elevated\u000aground, Tony saw his old guardian follow Abner.
p977
aVThus the way was opened\u000afor his escape.
p978
aVHe waited, however, a short time to make sure that all\u000awas safe, and then bade farewell to the farmer and his wife, thanking\u000athem heartily for their kindness to him.
p979
aV"Won't you stay longer with us?"
p980
aVasked the farmer.
p981
aV"You can as well as\u000anot."
p982
aV"Thank you," answered Tony, "but I wouldn't dare to.
p983
aVRudolph may be\u000aback for me, and I want to get away before he has a chance."
p984
aV"Are you going to walk?"
p985
aVasked the farmer's wife.
p986
aV"Yes," said Tony.
p987
aV"I've only got five cents in my pocket, and I can't\u000aride far on that."
p988
aV"I'm afraid you will be tired," said she, sympathetically.
p989
aV"Oh, I'm used to tramping," returned Tony, lightly.
p990
aV"I don't mind that\u000aat all."
p991
aV"Can't you put up some dinner for him, wife?"
p992
aVsuggested the farmer.
p993
aV"It'll make him hungry, walking."
p994
aV"To be sure I will," she replied, and a large supply of eatables were\u000aput in a paper, sufficient to last Tony twenty-four hours, at least.
p995
aVThe farmer deliberated whether he should not offer our hero half\u000aa dollar besides, but he was naturally close, so far as money was\u000aconcerned, and he decided in the negative.
p996
aVSo Tony set out, taking a course directly opposite to that pursued\u000aby Abner.
p997
aVIn this way he thought he should best avoid the chance of\u000ameeting Rudolph.
p998
aVHe walked easily, not being in any special hurry, and whenever he felt\u000aat all tired he stopped by the way side to rest.
p999
aVEarly in the afternoon\u000ahe lay down under a tree in the pasture and fell asleep.
p1000
aVHe was roused\u000aby a cold sensation, and found that a dog had pressed his cold nose\u000aagainst his cheek.
p1001
aV"Haven't you any more manners, sir?"
p1002
aVdemanded Tony, good-naturedly.
p1003
aVThe dog wagged his tail, and looked friendly.
p1004
aV"It's a hint that I must be on my journey," he thought.
p1005
aVAbout five o'clock he felt that it was about time to look out for a\u000anight's rest.
p1006
aVA hotel was, of course, out of the question, and he\u000alooked about for a farm house.
p1007
aVThe nearest dwelling was a small one, of\u000afour rooms, setting back from the road, down a lane.
p1008
aV"Perhaps I can get in there," thought Tony.
p1009
aVAn old man, with a patriarchal beard, whose neglected and squalid dress\u000aseemed to indicate poverty, was sitting on the door-step.
p1010
aV"Good evening," said Tony.
p1011
aV"Who are you?"
p1012
aVdemanded the old man, suspiciously.
p1013
aV"I am a poor traveler," said Tony.
p1014
aV"A tramp!"
p1015
aVsaid the old man, in the same suspicious tone.
p1016
aV"Yes, I suppose so," said Tony, although he did not like the title\u000aovermuch.
p1017
aV"Well, I've got nothing for you," said the old man, roughly.
p1018
aV"I don't want anything except the chance to sleep."
p1019
aV"Don't you want any supper?"
p1020
aV"No, I've got my supper here," returned our hero, producing his paper\u000aof provisions.
p1021
aV"What have you got there?"
p1022
aVasked the old man, with an eager look.
p1023
aV"Some bread and butter and cold meat."
p1024
aV"It looks good," said the other, with what Tony thought to be a longing\u000alook.
p1025
aV"I'll share it with you, if you'll let me sleep here to-night," said\u000aTony.
p1026
aV"Will you?"
p1027
aVthe other answered.
p1028
aV"Yes; there's enough for both of us."
p1029
aVThe old man was a miser, as Tony suspected.
p1030
aVHe was able to live\u000acomfortably, but he deprived himself of the necessaries of life in\u000aorder to hoard away money.
p1031
aVHis face revealed that to Tony.
p1032
aVHe had\u000anearly starved himself, but he had not overcome his natural appetites,\u000aand the sight of Tony's supper gave him a craving for it.
p1033
aV"I don't know," he said, doubtfully.
p1034
aV"If I let you sleep here you might\u000aget up in the night and rob me."
p1035
aVTony laughed.
p1036
aV"You don't look as if you had anything worth stealing," he said,\u000acandidly.
p1037
aV"You're right, quite right," said old Ben Hayden, for this was his\u000aname.
p1038
aV"I've only saved a little money--a very little--to pay my funeral\u000aexpenses.
p1039
aVYou wouldn't want to take that?"
p1040
aV"Oh, no," said Tony.
p1041
aV"I wouldn't take it if you'd give it to me."
p1042
aV"You wouldn't?
p1043
aVwhy not?"
p1044
aV"Because you need it yourself.
p1045
aVIf you were a rich man it would be\u000adifferent."
p1046
aV"So it would," said old Hayden.
p1047
aV"You're a good boy--an excellent boy.
p1048
aVI'll trust you.
p1049
aVYou can stay."
p1050
aV"Then let us eat supper," said Tony.
p1051
aVHe sat down on the door-step, and gave the old man half of his supply\u000aof food.
p1052
aVHe was interested to see the avidity with which he ate it.
p1053
aV"Is it good?"
p1054
aVhe asked.
p1055
aV"I haven't eaten anything so good for a long time.
p1056
aVI couldn't afford to\u000abuy food."
p1057
aV"I am sorry for you."
p1058
aV"You haven't got any left for breakfast," said the old man.
p1059
aV"Oh, somebody will give me breakfast," said Tony.
p1060
aV"I always get taken\u000acare of somehow."
p1061
aV"You are young and strong."
p1062
aV"Yes."
p1063
aV"Do you travel around all the time?"
p1064
aV"Yes; but I hope to get a chance to go to work soon; I'd rather live in\u000aone place."
p1065
aV"You might live with me if I were not so poor," said the old man.
p1066
aV"Thank you," answered Tony, politely; but it did not appear to him that\u000ait was exactly such a home as he would choose.
p1067
aV"Do you live alone?"
p1068
aVhe asked.
p1069
aV"Yes."
p1070
aV"I didn't know but you might be married."
p1071
aV"I was married when I was a young man, but my wife died long ago."
p1072
aV"Why don't you marry again?"
p1073
aVinquired Tony, half in fun.
p1074
aV"I couldn't afford it," answered Hayden, frightened at the suggestion.
p1075
aV"Women have terrible appetites."
p1076
aV"Have they?"
p1077
aVreturned Tony, amused.
p1078
aV"And I can't get enough for myself to eat."
p1079
aV"Have you always lived here?"
p1080
aV"No; I lived in England when I was a young man."
p1081
aV"What made you leave it?"
p1082
aV"Why do you ask me that?"
p1083
aVdemanded old Ben, suspiciously.
p1084
aV"Oh, if it's a secret, don't tell me," said Tony, indifferently.
p1085
aV"Who said it was a secret?"
p1086
aVsaid the old man, irritably.
p1087
aV"Nobody that I know of."
p1088
aV"Then why do you ask me such questions?"
p1089
aVThe old man surveyed Tony with a look of doubt, as if he thought the\u000aboy were laying a trap for him.
p1090
aV"Don't answer anything you don't want to," said our hero.
p1091
aV"I only asked\u000afor the sake of saying something."
p1092
aV"I don't mind telling," said old Ben, more calmly.
p1093
aV"It was because I\u000awas so poor.
p1094
aVI thought I could do better in America."
p1095
aV"And didn't you?"
p1096
aV"When I was able to work.
p1097
aVNow I'm weak and poor, and can't always get\u000aenough to eat."
p1098
aV"Do you own this place?"
p1099
aV"Yes, but it's a very poor place.
p1100
aVIt isn't worth much."
p1101
aV"I shouldn't think it was," said Tony.
p1102
aV"You're a good lad--an excellent lad.
p1103
aVYou see how poor I am."
p1104
aV"Of course I do, and I'm sorry for you.
p1105
aVI would help you, only I am\u000avery poor myself."
p1106
aV"Have you got any money?"
p1107
aVasked Ben, with interest.
p1108
aV"I've got five cents," answered Tony, laughing.
p1109
aV"I hope you've got more\u000athan that."
p1110
aV"A little more--a very little more," said Ben, cautiously.
p1111
aVThe old miser began to consider whether he couldn't charge Tony five\u000acents for his lodging, but sighed at the recollection that Tony had\u000aalready paid for it in advance by giving him a supper.
p1112
aVWhen eight o'clock came the miser suggested going to bed.
p1113
aV"I haven't any lights," he said; "candles cost so much.
p1114
aVBesides, a\u000abody's better off in bed."
p1115
aV"I'm willing to go to bed," said Tony.
p1116
aV"I've walked a good deal to-day,\u000aand I'm tired."
p1117
aVThey went into the house.
p1118
aVThere was a heap of rags in the corner of the\u000aroom when they entered.
p1119
aV"That's my bed," said old Ben; "it's all I have."
p1120
aV"I can sleep on the floor," said Tony.
p1121
aVHe took off his jacket, and rolled it up for a pillow, and stretched\u000ahimself out on the bare floor.
p1122
aVHe had often slept so before.
p1123
aVCHAPTER VIII.
p1124
aVTONY HIRES OUT AS A COOK AND HOUSEKEEPER.
p1125
aVTony was not slow in going to sleep.
p1126
aVNeither his hard bed nor his\u000astrange bed-chamber troubled him.
p1127
aVHe could sleep anywhere.
p1128
aVThat was one\u000aof the advantages of his checkered life.
p1129
aVGenerally he slept all night without awaking, but to-night, for some\u000aunknown reason, he awoke about two o'clock.
p1130
aVIt was unusually light for\u000athat hour, and so he was enabled to see what at first startled him.
p1131
aVThe\u000aold man was out of bed, and on his knees in the center of the room.
p1132
aVHe\u000ahad raised a plank, forming a part of the flooring, and had raised from\u000abeneath it a canvass bag full of gold pieces.
p1133
aVHe was taking them out\u000aand counting them, apparently quite unconscious of Tony's presence.
p1134
aVTony raised himself on his elbow, and looked at him.
p1135
aVIt occurred to him\u000athat for a man so suspicious it was strange that he should expose his\u000ahoard before a stranger.
p1136
aVSomething, however, in the old man's look led\u000ahim to think that he was in a sleepwalking fit.
p1137
aV"Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven," Tony heard him count; "that\u000amakes nine hundred and seventy dollars, all gold, good, beautiful gold.
p1138
aVNobody knows the old man is so rich.
p1139
aVThere's another bag, too.
p1140
aVThere\u000aare one hundred pieces in that.
p1141
aVThree more, and this will be full, too.
p1142
aVNobody must know, nobody must know."
p1143
aVHe put back the pieces, replaced the bag in its hiding-place, and then\u000aputting back the plank, laid down once more on his heap of rags.
p1144
aV"How uneasy he would be," thought Tony, "if he knew I had seen his\u000atreasures.
p1145
aVBut I wouldn't rob him for the world, although the money\u000awould do me good, and he makes no use of it except to look at it."
p1146
aVIf Tony was honest, it was an instinctive feeling.
p1147
aVIt could not have\u000abeen expected of one reared as he had been.
p1148
aVBut, singular as it may\u000aseem, beyond a vague longing, he felt no temptation to deprive old Ben\u000aof his money.
p1149
aV"Let him get what satisfaction he can from it," he said to himself.
p1150
aV"I\u000ahope he'll keep it till he dies.
p1151
aVI am only afraid that some night some\u000aone will see him counting the gold who will want to take it."
p1152
aVTony went to bed again, and slept till six.
p1153
aVThen he was awakened by a\u000apiteous groaning, which he soon found proceeded from the other bed.
p1154
aV"What's the matter?"
p1155
aVhe asked.
p1156
aV"Who's there?"
p1157
aVdemanded Ben, terrified.
p1158
aV"It's only I.
p1159
aVDon't you remember you let me sleep here last night?"
p1160
aV"O, yes; I remember now.
p1161
aVI'm sick; very sick."
p1162
aV"How do you feel?"
p1163
aV"I'm aching and trembling all over.
p1164
aVDo you think I am going to die?"
p1165
aVhe asked, with a startled look.
p1166
aV"Oh, no, I guess not," said Tony, reassuringly.
p1167
aV"Everybody is sick now\u000aand then."
p1168
aV"I never felt so before," groaned Ben.
p1169
aV"I'm an old man.
p1170
aVDon't you\u000athink--don't you really think I shall die?"
p1171
aVHe looked appealingly at Tony, as if the fiat of life and death lay\u000awith him.
p1172
aVTony, of course, knew nothing of medicine or of diseases, but he had\u000athe sense to understand that the old man would be more likely to\u000arecover if his terror could be allayed, and he said, lightly:\u000a\u000a"Oh, it's only a trifle.
p1173
aVYou've taken cold, very likely.
p1174
aVA cup of hot\u000atea would be good for you."
p1175
aV"I haven't any tea," groaned Ben.
p1176
aV"It costs a great deal, and I'm very\u000apoor.
p1177
aVI can't afford to buy it."
p1178
aVTony smiled to himself, remembering the hoard of gold under the floor,\u000abut he would not refer to it, at least not at present.
p1179
aV"Are you sure you haven't got a little money?"
p1180
aVhe asked.
p1181
aV"If you want\u000ato get well, you must be made comfortable."
p1182
aV"It's hard to be poor," whined Ben.
p1183
aV"I guess you've got some money," said Tony.
p1184
aV"You'd better let me go to\u000athe store, and buy some tea and a fresh roll for you."
p1185
aV"How much will it cost?"
p1186
aVasked Ben.
p1187
aV"I can get some bread, and tea, and sugar for thirty or forty cents,"\u000aanswered Tony.
p1188
aV"Forty cents!
p1189
aVIt's frightful!"
p1190
aVexclaimed Ben.
p1191
aV"I--I guess I'll do\u000awithout it."
p1192
aV"Oh, well, if you prefer to lie there and die its none of my business,"\u000asaid Tony, rather provoked at the old man's perverse folly.
p1193
aV"But I don't want to die," whined Ben.
p1194
aV"Then do as I tell you."
p1195
aVTony jumped out of bed, unrolled his coat, and put it on.
p1196
aV"Now," said he, "I'm ready to go for you, if you'll give me the money."
p1197
aV"But you may take it, and not come back," said the old man,\u000asuspiciously.
p1198
aV"If you think you can't trust me, you needn't," said Tony.
p1199
aV"I've\u000aoffered to do you a favor."
p1200
aV"I think I'll go myself," said Ben.
p1201
aVHe tried to raise himself, but a twinge of pain compelled him to lie\u000adown again.
p1202
aV"No, I can't," he said.
p1203
aV"Well, do you want me to go for you?"
p1204
aV"Yes," answered Ben, reluctantly.
p1205
aV"Then give me the money."
p1206
aVStill more reluctantly Ben produced twenty-five cents from his pocket.
p1207
aV"Isn't that enough?"
p1208
aVhe asked.
p1209
aV"Better give me more," said Tony.
p1210
aVHe produced ten cents more, and vowed it was all the money he had in\u000athe world.
p1211
aVTony decided not to contradict his assertion, but to make this go as\u000afar as it would.
p1212
aVHe put on his hat and started out.
p1213
aVHe meant also to\u000acall at the doctor's, and asked him to call round, for he thought it\u000apossible that the old man might be seriously sick.
p1214
aVFirst, however, he went to the grocery store, which had only just been\u000aopened, and obtained the articles which he had mentioned to Ben as\u000alikely to do him good.
p1215
aVNext he called at the house of the village doctor, obtaining the\u000adirection from the storekeeper.
p1216
aVIn a few words he made known his errand.
p1217
aV"Old Ben sick!"
p1218
aVsaid Doctor Compton.
p1219
aV"What's the matter with him?"
p1220
aVTony explained how he appeared to be affected.
p1221
aV"How did you happen to be in his house?"
p1222
aVasked the doctor, with\u000acuriosity.
p1223
aV"You are not a relation of his, are you?"
p1224
aVTony laughed.
p1225
aV"I don't think he would let me into the house if I were," he said.
p1226
aV"He\u000awould be suspicious of me."
p1227
aV"Then how does it happen that you were with him?"
p1228
aVTony explained.
p1229
aV"He has been repaid for taking you in," said the doctor.
p1230
aV"I'll put on\u000amy hat, and go right over with you."
p1231
aVAfter Tony left the house, old Ben lay and tormented himself with the\u000athought that the boy would never come back.
p1232
aV"Just as like as not," he\u000athought, "he will go off with the money, and leave me here to die."
p1233
aVThen he tried to sit up, but without success.
p1234
aVHalf an hour later he was relieved by seeing the door open, and Tony\u000aenter.
p1235
aVBut he looked dismayed when he saw the doctor.
p1236
aV"What did you come for?"
p1237
aVhe asked, peevishly.
p1238
aV"To see what I can do for you, Mr. Hayden.
p1239
aVLet me feel your pulse."
p1240
aV"But I can't afford to have a doctor.
p1241
aVI am poor, and can't pay you,"\u000awhined old Ben.
p1242
aV"We'll talk about that afterward."
p1243
aV"You can't charge when I didn't send for you."
p1244
aV"Make your mind easy.
p1245
aVI won't charge for this visit.
p1246
aVLet me feel your\u000apulse."
p1247
aVOld Ben no longer opposed medical treatment, finding it would cost\u000anothing.
p1248
aV"Am I going to die?"
p1249
aVhe asked, with an anxious look.
p1250
aV"You need nourishing food and care, that is all," was the reply.
p1251
aV"You\u000ahave had a chill, and you are reduced by insufficient food."
p1252
aV"I have some bread and tea here," said Tony.
p1253
aV"Do you know how to make the tea?"
p1254
aVasked the doctor.
p1255
aV"Yes," said Tony.
p1256
aV"Then make a fire, and boil it at once.
p1257
aVAnd, by the way, Mr. Hayden\u000aneeds somebody to be with him for a few days.
p1258
aVCan you stay with him and\u000alook after him?"
p1259
aV"If he will give me money enough to buy what he needs," said Tony.
p1260
aV"Will you do it, Mr.
p1261
aVHayden?"
p1262
aVasked the doctor.
p1263
aVOld Ben whined that he was poor, and had no money, but the doctor\u000ainterrupted him impatiently.
p1264
aV"That's all nonsense," he said.
p1265
aV"You may not have much money, but\u000ayou've got some, and you'll die if you don't spend some on yourself.
p1266
aVIf you don't agree to it, I shall advise this boy here to leave you to\u000ayour fate.
p1267
aVThen your only resource will be to go to the poor-house."
p1268
aVThis proposal was not acceptable to Ben, who was unwilling to leave\u000athe house where his treasures were concealed.
p1269
aVHe therefore reluctantly\u000aacceded to the doctor's conditions, and Tony got his breakfast.
p1270
aVDespite\u000ahis sickness, he relished the tea and toast, and for the moment forgot\u000awhat it cost.
p1271
aV"Well," thought Tony to himself with a smile, "I've got a situation as\u000aplain cook and housekeeper.
p1272
aVI wonder how long it will last, and what'll\u000acome of it.
p1273
aVI don't believe Rudolph will look for me here."
p1274
aVBut in this Tony was mistaken.
p1275
aVCHAPTER IX.
p1276
aVTHE FACE AT THE WINDOW.
p1277
aVTony was not only cook and housekeeper, but he was sick-nurse as well.
p1278
aVNor were his duties easy.
p1279
aVThe main difficulty was about getting money\u000ato buy what was absolutely necessary.
p1280
aVThis was very aggravating,\u000aespecially since Tony knew what he did about Ben's hidden treasure.
p1281
aVMoreover, he had reason to suspect that Ben had more money concealed\u000aelsewhere.
p1282
aVOne morning Tony went to Ben for money, saying:\u000a\u000a"There isn't a scrap of food in the house, except a little tea."
p1283
aV"You can make some tea.
p1284
aVThat will do," said Ben.
p1285
aV"It may do for you, but it won't for me," said Tony, resolutely.
p1286
aV"I\u000aain't going to stay here to starve."
p1287
aV"It costs a sight to support two people," whined the old man.
p1288
aV"I don't know about that.
p1289
aVI've only spent two dollars in six days.
p1290
aVYou\u000adon't call that much, do you?"
p1291
aV"Two dollars!"
p1292
aVejaculated the old man, terrified.
p1293
aV"O, it's too much.
p1294
aVI\u000aam ruined!"
p1295
aV"Are you?"
p1296
aVsaid Tony, coolly.
p1297
aV"Then all I can say is, you're easy\u000aruined.
p1298
aVI want half a dollar."
p1299
aV"I shan't give it to you," snarled Ben.
p1300
aV"Do you mean to starve?"
p1301
aV"I won't part with all I have.
p1302
aVYou are robbing me."
p1303
aV"That won't make much difference, as you'll be dead in three days,"\u000asaid Tony.
p1304
aV"What?"
p1305
aValmost shrieked Ben, in dismay.
p1306
aV"Who told you so?
p1307
aVThe doctor?"
p1308
aV"No."
p1309
aV"You ain't goin' to murder me, are you?"
p1310
aV"No; you are going to murder yourself."
p1311
aV"What do you mean?"
p1312
aVdemanded Ben, peevishly.
p1313
aV"You're not willing to buy anything to eat," explained Tony, "and you\u000acan't live above three days on nothing."
p1314
aV"Is that all?
p1315
aVWhat made you frighten me so?"
p1316
aVcomplained Ben, angrily.
p1317
aV"I only told you the truth.
p1318
aVAre you going to give me the money?"
p1319
aV"Perhaps you'll tell me where I am to get so much money?"
p1320
aVsaid Ben, in\u000athe same tone.
p1321
aV"I will tell you if you want me to," answered Tony.
p1322
aV"Where?"
p1323
aVasked Ben, eagerly.
p1324
aV"Under the floor," returned Tony, composedly.
p1325
aV"What!"
p1326
aVscreamed Ben, in consternation.
p1327
aV"Just where I said.
p1328
aVThere's plenty of money under that plank."
p1329
aV"Who told you?"
p1330
aVgroaned the old man, livid with terror.
p1331
aV"Have--have you\u000ataken any?"
p1332
aV"Not a dollar.
p1333
aVIt's all there.
p1334
aVYou needn't be frightened."
p1335
aV"Have you been spying when I was asleep?"
p1336
aVdemanded Ben, incensed.
p1337
aV"No, I haven't.
p1338
aVThat ain't my style," answered Tony, independently.
p1339
aV"You did.
p1340
aVI know you did."
p1341
aV"Then you know too much."
p1342
aV"How could you find out, then?"
p1343
aV"If you want to know, I'll tell you.
p1344
aVThe first night I was here you got\u000aup in your sleep and took up the board.
p1345
aVThen you drew out two bags of\u000agold pieces and counted them."
p1346
aV"Oh, I'm ruined!
p1347
aVI'm undone!"
p1348
aVlamented Ben, when he found that his\u000asecret had been discovered.
p1349
aV"I don't see how you are."
p1350
aV"I shall be robbed.
p1351
aVThere's only a little there--only a few dollars to\u000abury me."
p1352
aV"I guess you mean to have a tall funeral, then," said Tony, coolly.
p1353
aV"There's as much as a thousand dollars there."
p1354
aV"No, no--only fifty," answered the old man.
p1355
aV"There's no use talking, I know better.
p1356
aVIf you don't believe it,\u000asuppose I take up the bags and count the pieces."
p1357
aV"No, no!"
p1358
aV"Just as you say.
p1359
aVAll is, you've got plenty of money, and I know it,\u000aand if you ain't willing to use some of it, I'll go off and leave you\u000aalone."
p1360
aV"Don't go," said Ben, hastily.
p1361
aV"You're a good boy.
p1362
aVYou wouldn't rob a\u000apoor old man, would you?"
p1363
aV"Nor a rich old man either; but I don't mean to starve.
p1364
aVSo give me\u000afifty cents, and I'll go over to the store and get some fresh bread and\u000abutter, and tea and sugar."
p1365
aV"No matter about the butter.
p1366
aVIt costs too much."
p1367
aV"I want butter myself.
p1368
aVMy constitution requires it," said Tony.
p1369
aV"You\u000aneedn't eat it if you don't want to."
p1370
aVBen groaned again, but he produced the money required, and Tony soon\u000areturned from the grocery store with small supplies of the articles he\u000ahad named.
p1371
aV"Now we'll have some breakfast," said Tony, cheerfully.
p1372
aV"Don't you feel\u000ahungry?"
p1373
aV"A--a little," acknowledged Ben, reluctantly.
p1374
aV"I wish I wasn't.
p1375
aVIt\u000acosts so much to live."
p1376
aV"I don't think it costs you much," said Tony.
p1377
aV"This morning I'm going\u000ato give you a boiled egg besides your tea and toast."
p1378
aV"Where did you get it?"
p1379
aV"I bought it at the store."
p1380
aV"I can't afford it," groaned the old man.
p1381
aV"You may as well eat it as it's here.
p1382
aVI bought two, one for myself."
p1383
aV"How much did you pay?"
p1384
aV"Three cents for two."
p1385
aVBen groaned again, but when breakfast was ready he showed an unusually\u000agood appetite, and did not refrain from partaking of the egg, expensive\u000aas it was.
p1386
aVDr. Compton came in the next morning, and pronounced the old man better\u000aand stronger.
p1387
aV"Shall I be able to get up soon, doctor?"
p1388
aVasked Ben.
p1389
aV"In a day or two, I think."
p1390
aVBen heaved a sigh of relief.
p1391
aV"I'm glad of it," he said.
p1392
aV"I can't afford to be sick."
p1393
aV"Has it cost you much?"
p1394
aVasked the doctor, amused.
p1395
aV"It costs a sight to live.
p1396
aVHe eats a good deal," indicating Tony.
p1397
aV"He's a growing boy; but he's worth all he costs you.
p1398
aVYou'd better\u000aask him to stay with you a few weeks, till your strength is entirely\u000arecovered."
p1399
aV"No, no; I can't afford it," said Ben, hastily.
p1400
aV"He's a good boy; but\u000ahe's very hearty--very hearty."
p1401
aVTony laughed.
p1402
aV"Don't vex him, doctor," said our hero.
p1403
aV"I'm tired of staying here.
p1404
aVI\u000awant to get out on the road again.
p1405
aVThere isn't much fun in staying shut\u000aup here."
p1406
aVBen looked relieved.
p1407
aVHe had feared that Tony would be reluctant to go.
p1408
aV"Right, boy," he said, "you're right.
p1409
aVIt's a dull place.
p1410
aVYou'll be\u000abetter off to go."
p1411
aV"You have been lucky to have him here during your sickness," said the\u000adoctor.
p1412
aV"Without his care, or that of some one else, you would probably\u000ahave died."
p1413
aV"But I won't die now?"
p1414
aVasked old Ben, anxiously, peering up into the\u000adoctor's face.
p1415
aV"Not at present, I hope.
p1416
aVBut you must live better than you have been\u000aaccustomed to do or you will fall sick again."
p1417
aV"I shall be glad to get away," said Tony, hurriedly, to the doctor,\u000aoutside of the house.
p1418
aV"I'm used to tramping, and I can't stand it much\u000alonger.
p1419
aVThere's one thing I want to tell you before I go, and I might\u000aas well do it now."
p1420
aV"Go on, my boy."
p1421
aV"I'm afraid the old man will be robbed some time."
p1422
aV"Is there anything to steal?"
p1423
aV"Yes; I think I had better tell you about it."
p1424
aVTony, in a low tone, imparted to Dr. Compton the discovery he had made\u000aof the old miser's hoards.
p1425
aV"I suspected as much," said the doctor.
p1426
aV"I will do what I can to induce\u000aBen to have the gold moved to a place of safety, but I don't feel\u000aconfident of my ability to do it.
p1427
aVSuch men generally like to have their\u000ahoards within their own reach."
p1428
aV*       *       *       *       *       *\u000a\u000aTwo nights later, Tony woke shortly after midnight.
p1429
aVIt was a bright,\u000amoonlight night, as on the first night he slept there.
p1430
aVAgain he saw Ben\u000acrouched on the floor, with the plank removed from its place, engaged\u000ain counting his hoards.
p1431
aVThe old man had recovered enough strength to\u000aget out of bed without assistance.
p1432
aVThis time, too, he was broad awake.
p1433
aVTony was not the only witness of the spectacle.
p1434
aVCasting his eyes toward\u000athe window he was startled by seeing a dark, sinister face, pressed\u000aagainst the pane, almost devouring the old man and his gold.
p1435
aVIt was a face he well knew, and he trembled not alone for Ben, but for\u000ahimself.
p1436
aV_It was the face of Rudolph, the tramp._\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER X.
p1437
aVTHE TRAMP'S UNEXPECTED DEFEAT.
p1438
aV"Has Rudolph tracked me, or is it only accident that has brought him\u000ahere?"
p1439
aVThis was the thought which naturally suggested itself to our hero, as\u000ain a very disturbed state of mind he stared at Rudolph through the\u000auncertain light.
p1440
aVHe decided that it was accident, for as yet the tramp did not appear\u000ato have discovered him.
p1441
aVHis eyes were fastened upon old Ben with\u000aunmistakable cupidity.
p1442
aVIt was the gold that attracted him, and between\u000ahim and the possession of the gold it seemed as if there were no\u000aobstacle to intervene.
p1443
aVWhat was the old man's feeble strength, more\u000afeeble still through disease, against this powerful man?
p1444
aVTony felt the difficulties of the position.
p1445
aVNot only would the gold be\u000ataken, but as soon as Rudolph discovered him, as he would, he too would\u000afall into the power of the tramp.
p1446
aVOld Ben had not yet discovered the sinister face at the window.
p1447
aVHe was\u000atoo busily occupied with his pleasant employment of counting over his\u000agold for the hundredth time, it might be, to be aware of the dangerous\u000awitness at the window.
p1448
aVBut he was speedily aroused by the noise of the window being raised\u000afrom the outside.
p1449
aVThen he turned with a startled look which quickly deepened into\u000aastonishment and dismay as he caught the lowering look fixed upon him.
p1450
aVThere was more than this.
p1451
aVThere was recognition besides.
p1452
aV"You here?"
p1453
aVhe gasped, mechanically gathering up the gold in his\u000atrembling fingers, with the intention of replacing it in the bag.
p1454
aV"Yes, Ben, it's me," answered the tramp, with a sneer.
p1455
aV"May I come in?"
p1456
aV"No, no!"
p1457
aVejaculated the old man, hastily.
p1458
aV"I think I must," returned the tramp, in the same mocking tone.
p1459
aV"I came\u000ato see you as an old friend, but I never dreamed you were so rich.
p1460
aVThat's a pretty lot of gold you have there."
p1461
aV"Rich!"
p1462
aVrepeated Ben, with his usual whine.
p1463
aV"I'm very poor."
p1464
aV"That looks like it."
p1465
aV"It's only a few dollars--enough to bury me."
p1466
aV"Very well, Ben, I'll take charge of it, and when you need burial I'll\u000aattend to it.
p1467
aVThat's fair, isn't it?"
p1468
aVRudolph, who had paused outside, now raised the window to its full\u000aheight, and despite the old man's terrified exclamations, bounded\u000alightly into the room.
p1469
aV"Help!
p1470
aVhelp!
p1471
aVthieves!"
p1472
aVscreamed Ben, almost beside himself with terror,\u000aas he spread his feeble hands over the gold which he had so imprudently\u000aexposed.
p1473
aV"Hold your jaw, you driveling old idiot," said Rudolph, harshly, "or\u000aI'll give you something to yell about."
p1474
aV"Help, Tony, help!"
p1475
aVcontinued the old man.
p1476
aVThe tramp's eyes, following the direction of Ben's, discovered our hero\u000aon his rude bed in the corner of the room.
p1477
aVA quick gleam of exultation\u000ashot from them as he made this discovery.
p1478
aV"Ho, ho!"
p1479
aVhe laughed with a mirth that boded ill to Tony, "so I've\u000afound you at last, have I?
p1480
aVYou served me a nice trick the other day,\u000adidn't you?
p1481
aVI owe you something for that."
p1482
aV"I hoped I should never set eyes on you again," said Tony.
p1483
aV"I've no doubt you did.
p1484
aVYou undertook to run away from me, did you?
p1485
aVI\u000aknew I should come across you sooner or later."
p1486
aVWhile this conversation was going on, Ben glanced from one to the other\u000ain surprise, his attention momentarily drawn away from his own troubles.
p1487
aV"Do you know this boy, Rudolph?"
p1488
aVhe inquired.
p1489
aV"I should think I did," answered the tramp, grimly.
p1490
aV"You can ask him."
p1491
aV"_Who is he?_" asked Ben, evidently excited.
p1492
aV"What is that to you?"
p1493
aVreturned Rudolph.
p1494
aV"It's a boy I picked up, and\u000ahave taken care of, and this is his gratitude to me, and I've had a\u000along chase to find him."
p1495
aV"Is this true?"
p1496
aVasked Ben, turning to Tony.
p1497
aV"Some of it is true," said our hero.
p1498
aV"I've been with him ever since\u000aI could remember, and I ran away because he wanted me to join him in\u000arobbing a house.
p1499
aVHe calls me his son sometimes, but I know he is not my\u000afather."
p1500
aV"How do you know?"
p1501
aVdemanded the tramp sternly.
p1502
aV"Didn't you say so just now?"
p1503
aV"It was none of the old man's business, and I did not care what I told\u000ahim."
p1504
aV"There's something within me tells me that there's no relationship\u000abetween us," said Tony, boldly.
p1505
aV"Is there, indeed," sneered the tramp.
p1506
aV"Is there anything within you\u000atells you you are going to get a good flogging?"
p1507
aV"No, there isn't."
p1508
aV"Then you needn't trust it, for that is just what is going to happen."
p1509
aVHe advanced toward Tony in a threatening manner, when he was diverted\u000afrom his purpose by seeing the old man hastily gathering up the gold\u000awith the intention of putting it away.
p1510
aVPunishment could wait, he\u000athought, but the gold must be secured now.
p1511
aV"Not so fast, Ben!"
p1512
aVhe said.
p1513
aV"You must lend me some of that."
p1514
aV"I can't," said Ben, hurrying all the faster.
p1515
aV"It's all I have, and I\u000aam very poor."
p1516
aV"I am poorer still, for I haven't a red to bless myself with.
p1517
aVCome, I\u000awon't take all, but some I must have."
p1518
aVHe stooped over, and began to grasp at the gold pieces, some of which\u000awere heaped up in piles upon the floor.
p1519
aVEven the weakest are capable of harm when exasperated, and Ben, feeble\u000aas he was, was gifted with supernatural strength when he saw himself\u000alikely to lose the hoards of a lifetime, and his anger rose to fever\u000aheat against the scoundrel whom he had known years before to be utterly\u000aunprincipled.
p1520
aVWith a cry like that of a wild beast he sprang upon the tramp, who, in\u000ahis crouching position, was unable to defend himself against a sudden\u000aattack.
p1521
aVRudolph fell with violence backward, striking his head with\u000agreat force against the brick hearth.
p1522
aVStrong as he was, it was too much\u000afor him, and he lay stunned and insensible, with the blood gushing from\u000aa wound in his head.
p1523
aVThe old man stood appalled at the consequence of his sudden attack.
p1524
aV"Have I killed him?
p1525
aVShall I be hanged?"
p1526
aVhe asked, with anguish.
p1527
aV"No, he's only stunned!"
p1528
aVsaid Tony, springing over the floor with all\u000ahis wits about him.
p1529
aV"We have no time to lose."
p1530
aV"To run away?
p1531
aVI can't leave my gold," said Ben.
p1532
aV"I don't mean that.
p1533
aVWe must secure him against doing us any harm when\u000ahe recovers.
p1534
aVHave you got some stout cord?"
p1535
aV"Yes, yes," said Ben, beginning to understand our hero's design.
p1536
aV"Stay,\u000aI'll get it right away."
p1537
aV"You'd better, for he may come to any minute."
p1538
aVThe old man fumbled round until in some out-of-the-way corner, where\u000ahe had laid away a store of odds and ends, he discovered a quantity of\u000astout cord.
p1539
aV"Will that do?"
p1540
aVhe asked.
p1541
aV"Just the thing," said Tony.
p1542
aVThe boy set to work with rapid hands to tie the prostrate tramp hand\u000aand foot.
p1543
aVHe was only afraid Rudolph would rouse to consciousness while\u000athe operation was going on, but the shock was too great, and he had\u000asufficient time to do the job effectually and well.
p1544
aV"How brave you are," exclaimed the old man, admiringly.
p1545
aV"I wouldn't\u000adare to touch him."
p1546
aV"Nor I if he were awake.
p1547
aVI didn't think you were so strong.
p1548
aVHe went\u000aover as if he were shot."
p1549
aV"Did he?"
p1550
aVasked the old man, bewildered.
p1551
aV"I don't know how I did it.
p1552
aVI\u000afeel as weak as a baby now."
p1553
aV"It's lucky for us you threw yourself upon him as you did.
p1554
aVA little\u000amore cord, Mr. Hayden.
p1555
aVI want to tie him securely.
p1556
aVYou'd better be\u000agathering up that gold, and putting it away before he comes to."
p1557
aV"So I will, so I will," said Ben, hastily.
p1558
aVScarcely was the money put away in its place of concealment, when the\u000atramp recovered from his fit of unconsciousness, and looked stupidly\u000aaround him.
p1559
aVThen he tried to move, and found himself hampered by his\u000abonds.
p1560
aVLooking up, he met the terrified gaze of old Ben, and the steady\u000aglance of Tony.
p1561
aVThen the real state of the case flashed upon him, and\u000ahe was filled with an overpowering rage at the audacity of his late\u000acharge, to whom he rightly attributed his present humiliating plight.

p1563
aVTHE PRISONER.
p1564
aV"Let me up!"
p1565
aVroared Rudolph, struggling vigorously with the cords that\u000abound him.
p1566
aVBen was terrified by his demonstration, and had half a mind to comply\u000awith his demand.
p1567
aVBut Tony had his wits about him, and felt that there\u000awas no safety in such a course.
p1568
aV"Don't you do it, Mr.
p1569
aVHayden!"
p1570
aVhe exclaimed, hastily.
p1571
aV"What!
p1572
aVyoung jackanapes," said the tramp, scowling fiercely.
p1573
aV"You dare\u000ato give him this advice?"
p1574
aV"Yes, I do," said Tony, boldly.
p1575
aV"He will be a fool if he releases you."
p1576
aV"If he don't I'll kill him and you too," returned Rudolph.
p1577
aV"What shall I do?"
p1578
aVadded Ben, hopelessly.
p1579
aVHe turned for advice to the boy, who was fifty years his junior.
p1580
aVStrong\u000aand resolute spirits naturally assume the place of leading at any age.
p1581
aV"Do you know what he'll do if you untie him?"
p1582
aVasked Tony.
p1583
aV"What will I do?"
p1584
aVdemanded Rudolph.
p1585
aV"You will steal this old man's money.
p1586
aVIt was what you were about to do\u000awhen you fell over backwards."
p1587
aV"He threw me over," said the tramp, now gazing resentfully at Ben.
p1588
aV"I didn't mean to," said the terrified old man.
p1589
aV"You almost stunned me."
p1590
aV"I'm very sorry," stammered Ben.
p1591
aV"If you're very sorry, untie them cords and let me up."
p1592
aV"I didn't tie you."
p1593
aV"Who did?"
p1594
aV"The--the boy."
p1595
aV"You _dared_ to do it?"
p1596
aVexclaimed Rudolph, turning upon Tony with\u000aconcentrated fury.
p1597
aV"Yes, I did," said Tony, calmly.
p1598
aV"It was the only way to keep you out\u000aof mischief."
p1599
aV"Insolent puppy; if I only had my hands free I would strangle you both."
p1600
aV"You hear what he says?"
p1601
aVsaid Tony, turning to old Ben.
p1602
aV"Are you in\u000afavor of untying him now?"
p1603
aV"No, no!"
p1604
aVexclaimed Ben, trembling.
p1605
aV"He is a dreadful man.
p1606
aVO, why did\u000ahe come here?"
p1607
aV"I came for your gold, you fool, and I'll have it yet," said Rudolph,\u000alosing sight of all considerations of prudence.
p1608
aV"What shall I do?"
p1609
aVasked the old man, wringing his hands in the excess\u000aof his terror.
p1610
aV"Let me up, and I won't hurt you," said the tramp, finding that he must\u000acontrol his anger for the present.
p1611
aV"Just now you said you would strangle the both of us, Rudolph."
p1612
aV"I'll strangle you, you cub, but I will do no harm to the old man."
p1613
aV"You will take his gold."
p1614
aV"No."
p1615
aV"Don't you trust him, Mr. Hayden," said Tony.
p1616
aV"He will promise anything\u000ato get free, but he will forget all about it when he is unbound."
p1617
aV"I'd like to choke you!"
p1618
aVmuttered Rudolph, who meant thoroughly what he\u000asaid.
p1619
aV"But what shall I do, Tony?
p1620
aVI can't have him in here all the time."
p1621
aV"I'll go and call for help to arrest him," said Tony.
p1622
aV"And leave me alone with him?"
p1623
aVasked Ben, terrified.
p1624
aV"No; we will lock the door, and you shall go and stay outside till I\u000acome back."
p1625
aVTony's proposal was distasteful to Rudolph.
p1626
aVHe had a wholesome dread\u000aof the law, and didn't fancy the prospect of an arrest, especially as\u000ahe knew that the testimony of Tony and the old man would be sufficient\u000ato insure him a prolonged term of imprisonment.
p1627
aVHe made a fresh and\u000aviolent struggle which portended danger to his captors.
p1628
aV"Come out quick," said Tony, hastily.
p1629
aV"It is not safe for you to stay\u000ahere any longer."
p1630
aVThe old man followed him nothing loth, and Tony locked the door on the\u000aoutside.
p1631
aV"Do you think he will get free?"
p1632
aVasked Ben, nervously.
p1633
aV"He may, and if he does there is no safety for either of us till he is\u000acaught again."
p1634
aV"The door is locked."
p1635
aV"But he may get out of the window."
p1636
aV"Oh, my gold!
p1637
aVmy gold!"
p1638
aVgroaned Ben.
p1639
aV"He may get it."
p1640
aV"Yes, he may; our only hope is to secure him as soon as possible."
p1641
aV"I am so weak I can't go fast.
p1642
aVI am trembling in every limb."
p1643
aV"You must conceal yourself somewhere, and let me run on," said Tony,\u000awith decision.
p1644
aV"There is no time to be lost."
p1645
aV"I don't know of any place."
p1646
aV"Here's a place.
p1647
aVYou will be safe here till I come for you."
p1648
aVTony pointed to an old ruined shed, which they had just reached.
p1649
aV"Will you be sure and come for me."
p1650
aV"Yes; don't be alarmed.
p1651
aVOnly don't show yourself till you hear my\u000avoice."
p1652
aVBen crept into the temporary shelter, glad that in his weakened\u000acondition he should not be obliged to go any farther.
p1653
aVTo be sure he\u000atormented himself with the thought that even now the desperate tramp\u000amight be robbing him of his treasures.
p1654
aVStill he had great confidence in\u000awhat Tony had told him, and hope was mingled with his terror.
p1655
aV"He's a brave boy," he murmured.
p1656
aV"I am glad he was with me, though he\u000adoes eat a sight.
p1657
aVOh, how many wicked men there are in the world."
p1658
aVTony hurried on to the village, where he lost no time in arousing\u000aa sufficient number to effect the capture of the burglar.
p1659
aVHe no\u000alonger felt any compunction in turning against his quondam guardian,\u000arecognizing him as his own enemy and the enemy of society.
p1660
aV"I owe him nothing," thought Tony.
p1661
aV"What has he ever done for me?
p1662
aVHe is\u000anot my father.
p1663
aVProbably he kidnapped me from my real home, and has made\u000ame an outcast and a tramp like himself.
p1664
aVBut I will be so no longer.
p1665
aVI\u000awill learn a trade, or do something else to earn an honest livelihood.
p1666
aVI mean to become a respectable member of society, if I can."
p1667
aVIt took him half an hour before he could rouse the half-dozen men whom\u000ahe considered necessary to effect the arrest and get them under way.
p1668
aVMeanwhile Rudolph was not idle.
p1669
aVIt may be thought strange that he should have so much difficulty in\u000afreeing himself from the cords with which Tony had bound him.
p1670
aVBut it\u000amust be remembered that the boy had done his work well.
p1671
aVThe cord was\u000astout and strong, and he had had time to tie it in many knots, so that\u000aeven if one had been untied, the tramp would have found himself almost\u000aas far from liberty as ever.
p1672
aVAfter he had been locked in, Rudolph set about energetically to obtain\u000arelease.
p1673
aVHe succeeded in raising himself to his feet, but as his ankles\u000awere tied together this did not do him much good.
p1674
aVBy main strength he\u000atried to break the cords, but the only result was to chafe his wrists.
p1675
aV"What a fool I am," he exclaimed at length.
p1676
aV"The old man must have\u000asome table-knives about somewhere.
p1677
aVWith these I can cut the cords."
p1678
aVIt was not till some time had elapsed, however, that this very obvious\u000athought came to him.
p1679
aVFurther time was consumed in finding the knives.
p1680
aVWhen found, they--there were two--proved so dull that even if he had\u000ahad free use of one of his hands it would not have been found easy to\u000amake them of service.
p1681
aVBut when added to this was the embarrassment of\u000ahis fettered hands, it will not excite surprise that it required a long\u000atime to sever the tough cords which bound him.
p1682
aVBut success came at\u000alength.
p1683
aVHis arms were free, and he stretched them with exultation.
p1684
aVHis ankles next demanded attention, but this was a much easier task.
p1685
aV"Now for revenge!"
p1686
aVthought the tramp.
p1687
aV"The boy shall rue this night's\u000atask, or my name is not Rudolph."
p1688
aVWhatever else he might do, he must secure the miser's gold.
p1689
aVHe had seen\u000athe hiding-place.
p1690
aVHe removed the plank, and there, beneath him, visible in the moonlight,\u000alay the much-coveted bags of golden treasure.
p1691
aVHe rose from the floor, and, with the bags in his hand, jumped out of\u000athe still opened window.
p1692
aVBut he was too late.
p1693
aVTwo strong men seized him, each by an arm, and\u000asaid, sternly:\u000a\u000a"You are our prisoner."
p1694
aV[Illustration: Tony set to work with rapid hands to tie the prostrate\u000atramp hand and foot.--(See page 73.)]
p1695
aVCHAPTER XII.
p1696
aVTONY STARTS OUT ONCE MORE.
p1697
aVIt was not until after Rudolph's seizure that Ben, who had followed the\u000aextemporized police, discovered the bags of gold in the hands of the\u000atramp.
p1698
aV"Give me my money!"
p1699
aVhe shrieked, in excitement and anguish.
p1700
aV"Don't let\u000ahim carry it off."
p1701
aV"It's safe, Ben," said one of the captors.
p1702
aV"But who would have supposed\u000ayou had so much money?"
p1703
aV"It isn't much," faltered the old man.
p1704
aV"The bags are pretty heavy," was the significant rejoinder.
p1705
aV"Will you\u000atake two hundred dollars apiece for them?"
p1706
aV"No," said the old man, embarrassed.
p1707
aV"Then it seems there is considerable after all.
p1708
aVBut never mind.
p1709
aVTake\u000athem, and take better care of them hereafter."
p1710
aVBen advanced with as much alacrity as he could summon in his weakness,\u000aand stooped to pick up the bags.
p1711
aVHe had got hold of them when the\u000atramp, whose feet were unconfined, aimed a kick at him which completely\u000aupset him.
p1712
aVEven though he fell, however, he did not lose his grip of the bags, but\u000aclung to them while crying with pain.
p1713
aV"Take that, you old fool!"
p1714
aVmuttered the tramp.
p1715
aV"It's the first\u000ainstalment of the debt I owe you."
p1716
aV"Take him away, take him away!
p1717
aVHe will murder me!"
p1718
aVexclaimed old Ben,\u000ain terror.
p1719
aV"Come along.
p1720
aVYou've done mischief enough," said his captors, sternly,\u000aforcing the tramp along.
p1721
aV"I'll do more yet," muttered Rudolph.
p1722
aVHe turned to Tony, who stood at a little distance watching the fate of\u000ahis quondam companion.
p1723
aV"I've got a score to settle with you, young traitor.
p1724
aVThe day will come\u000afor that yet."
p1725
aV"I'm sorry for you, Rudolph," said Tony; "but you brought it on\u000ayourself."
p1726
aV"Bah!
p1727
aVyou hypocrite!"
p1728
aVretorted the tramp.
p1729
aV"I don't want any of your\u000asorrow.
p1730
aVIt won't save you when the day of reckoning comes."
p1731
aVHe was not allowed to say more, but was hurried away to the village\u000alockup for detention until he could be conveyed to more permanent\u000aquarters.
p1732
aVDoctor Compton was among the party who had been summoned by Tony.
p1733
aVHe\u000alingered behind, and took Ben apart.
p1734
aV"Mr. Hayden," he said, "I want to give you a piece of advice."
p1735
aV"What is it?"
p1736
aVasked the old man.
p1737
aV"Don't keep this gold in your house.
p1738
aVIt isn't safe."
p1739
aV"Who do you think will take it?"
p1740
aVasked Ben, with a scared look.
p1741
aV"None of those here this morning, unless this tramp should escape from\u000acustody."
p1742
aV"Do you think he will?"
p1743
aVasked the old man, in terror.
p1744
aV"I think not; but he may."
p1745
aV"If he don't, what danger is there?"
p1746
aV"It will get about that you have money secreted here, and I venture to\u000asay it will be stolen before three months are over."
p1747
aV"It will kill me," said Ben, piteously.
p1748
aV"Then put it out of reach of danger."
p1749
aV"Where?"
p1750
aV"I am going over to the county town, where there is a bank.
p1751
aVDeposit it\u000athere, and whenever you want any, go and get it."
p1752
aV"But banks break sometimes," said Ben, in alarm.
p1753
aV"This is an old, established institution.
p1754
aVYou need not be afraid of it.
p1755
aVEven if there is some danger, there is far less than here."
p1756
aV"But I can't see the money--I can't count it," objected Ben.
p1757
aV"You can see the deposit record in a book.
p1758
aVEven if that doesn't suit\u000ayou as well, you can sleep comfortably, knowing that you are not liable\u000ato be attacked and murdered by burglars."
p1759
aVThe old man vacillated, but finally yielded to the force of the\u000adoctor's reasoning.
p1760
aVA day or two later he rode over to the neighboring\u000atown, and saw his precious gold deposited in the vaults of the bank.
p1761
aVHe heaved a sigh as it was locked up, but on the whole was tolerably\u000areconciled to the step he had taken.
p1762
aVWe are anticipating, however.
p1763
aVWhen the confusion incident to the arrest was over, Tony came forward.
p1764
aV"Mr. Hayden," he said, "you are so much better that I think you can\u000aspare me now."
p1765
aV"But," said the old man, startled at the boy's question, "suppose\u000aRudolph comes back."
p1766
aV"I don't think he can.
p1767
aVHe will be put in prison."
p1768
aV"I suppose he will.
p1769
aVWhat a bold, bad man."
p1770
aV"Yes, he is a bad man, but I am sorry for him.
p1771
aVI don't like to think\u000aof one I have been with so long in the walls of a prison.
p1772
aVI suppose it\u000acan't be helped, though."
p1773
aV"How did you come to be with him?"
p1774
aVasked the old man, in a tone of\u000ainterest.
p1775
aV"I don't know.
p1776
aVI have been with him as long as I can remember.
p1777
aVYou used\u000ato know him, didn't you?"
p1778
aV"A little," said the old man, hastily.
p1779
aV"Where was it?"
p1780
aV"In England--long ago."
p1781
aV"In England.
p1782
aVWas he born in England?"
p1783
aVasked Tony, in surprise.
p1784
aV"Yes."
p1785
aV"And you, too?"
p1786
aV"Yes, I am an Englishman."
p1787
aV"Do you think I am English, too?"
p1788
aVasked the boy, eagerly.
p1789
aV"I think so; yes, I think so," answered Ben, cautiously.
p1790
aV"Have you any idea who I am--who were my parents?"
p1791
aV"No, I don't know," said Ben, slowly.
p1792
aV"Can you guess?"
p1793
aV"Don't trouble me now," said Ben, peevishly.
p1794
aV"I am not well.
p1795
aVMy head is\u000aconfused.
p1796
aVSome day I will think it over and tell you what I know."
p1797
aV"But if I am not here?"
p1798
aV"I will write it down and give it to the doctor."
p1799
aV"That will do," said Tony.
p1800
aV"I know he will keep it for me.
p1801
aVNow,\u000agood-by."
p1802
aV"Are you going?"
p1803
aV"Yes, I have my own way to make in the world.
p1804
aVI can't live on you any\u000alonger."
p1805
aV"To be sure not," said Ben, hastily.
p1806
aV"I am too poor to feed two\u000apersons, and you have a very large appetite."
p1807
aV"Yes," said Tony, laughing, "I believe I have a healthy appetite.
p1808
aVI'm\u000agrowing, you know."
p1809
aV"It must be that," said old Ben, with the air of one to whom a mystery\u000ahad just been made clear.
p1810
aV"What is your name?"
p1811
aV"Tony," answered our hero, in surprise at the question.
p1812
aV"No.
p1813
aVI mean your full name."
p1814
aV"That is more than I know.
p1815
aVI have always been called Tony, or Tony the\u000aTramp.
p1816
aVRudolph's last name is Rugg, and he pretends that I am his son.
p1817
aVIf I were, I should be Tony Rugg."
p1818
aV"You are not his son.
p1819
aVHe never had any son."
p1820
aV"I am glad to hear that.
p1821
aVI shan't have to say now that my father is in\u000ajail for robbery.
p1822
aVGood-by, Mr.
p1823
aVHayden."
p1824
aV"Good-by," said Ben, following the boy thoughtfully with his eyes till\u000ahe had disappeared round a turn in the road.
p1825
aV"Well," thought Tony, "I've set up for myself now in earnest.
p1826
aVRudolph\u000acan't pursue me, and there is no one else to interfere with me.
p1827
aVI must\u000asee what fortune waits me in the great world."
p1828
aVWith a light heart, and a pocket still lighter, Tony walked on for\u000aseveral miles.
p1829
aVThen he stopped at a country grocery store, and bought\u000afive cents worth of crackers.
p1830
aVThese he ate with a good appetite,\u000aslaking his thirst at a wayside spring.
p1831
aVHe was lying carelessly on the green sward, when a tin peddler's cart\u000adrove slowly along the road.
p1832
aV"Hallo, there!"
p1833
aVsaid the peddler.
p1834
aV"Hallo!"
p1835
aVsaid Tony.
p1836
aV"Are you travelin'?"
p1837
aV"Yes."
p1838
aV"Do you want a lift?"
p1839
aV"Yes," said Tony, with alacrity.
p1840
aV"Then get up here.
p1841
aVThere's room enough for both of us.
p1842
aVYou can hold the\u000areins when I stop anywhere."
p1843
aV"It's a bargain," said Tony.
p1844
aV"Are you travelin' for pleasure?"
p1845
aVasked the peddler, who was gifted\u000awith his share of curiosity.
p1846
aV"On business," said Tony.
p1847
aV"What is your business?
p1848
aVYou're too young for an agent."
p1849
aV"I want to find work," said Tony.
p1850
aV"You're a good, stout youngster.
p1851
aVYou'd ought to get something to do."
p1852
aV"So I think," said Tony.
p1853
aV"Ever worked any?"
p1854
aV"No."
p1855
aV"Got any folks?"
p1856
aV"If you mean wife and children, I haven't," answered our hero, with a\u000asmile.
p1857
aV"Ho, ho!"
p1858
aVlaughed the peddler.
p1859
aV"I guess not.
p1860
aVI mean father or mother,\u000auncles or aunts, and such like."
p1861
aV"No, I am alone in the world."
p1862
aV"Sho!
p1863
aVyou don't say so.
p1864
aVWell, that's a pity.
p1865
aVWhy, I've got forty-'leven\u000acousins and a mother-in-law to boot.
p1866
aVI'll sell her cheap."
p1867
aV"Never mind!"
p1868
aVsaid Tony.
p1869
aV"I won't deprive you of her."
p1870
aV"I'll tell you what," said the peddler, "I feel interested in you.
p1871
aVI'll\u000atake you round with me for a day or two, and maybe I can get you a\u000aplace.
p1872
aVWhat do you say?"
p1873
aV"Yes, and thank you," said Tony.
p1874
aV"Then it's settled.
p1875
aVGee up, Dobbin!"
p1876
aVCHAPTER XIII.
p1877
aVTONY GETS A PLACE.
p1878
aVToward the close of the next day the tin-peddler halted in front of a\u000acountry tavern, situated in a village of moderate size.
p1879
aV"I'm going to stay here over night," he said.
p1880
aV"Maybe they'll let me sleep in the barn," said Tony.
p1881
aV"In the barn!
p1882
aVWhy not in the house?"
p1883
aV"I haven't got any money, you know, Mr.
p1884
aVBickford."
p1885
aV"What's the odds?
p1886
aVThey won't charge anything extra for you to sleep\u000awith me."
p1887
aV"You're very kind, Mr. Bickford, but they won't keep me for nothing,\u000aand I don't want you to pay for me."
p1888
aVAt this moment the landlord came out on the piazza, and asked the\u000ahostler:\u000a\u000a"Where's Sam?"
p1889
aV"Gone home--says he's sick," answered James.
p1890
aV"Drat that boy!
p1891
aVIt's my opinion he was born lazy.
p1892
aVThat's what's the\u000amatter with him."
p1893
aV"I guess you're right, Mr. Porter," said James.
p1894
aV"The boy don't earn his\u000asalt."
p1895
aV"I wouldn't take him back if I had anybody to take his place."
p1896
aV"Do you hear that, Tony?"
p1897
aVsaid the peddler, nudging our hero.
p1898
aVTony was quick to take the hint.
p1899
aVHe walked to the landlord, and said:\u000a\u000a"I'll take his place."
p1900
aV"Who are you?"
p1901
aVasked the landlord, in surprise.
p1902
aV"I never saw you\u000abefore."
p1903
aV"I have just come," said Tony.
p1904
aV"I am looking for a place."
p1905
aV"What can you do?"
p1906
aV"Anything you want me to do."
p1907
aV"Have you any references?"
p1908
aV"I can refer to him," said Tony, pointing to the tin peddler.
p1909
aV"Oh, Mr. Bickford," said the landlord, with a glance of recognition.
p1910
aV"Well, that's enough.
p1911
aVI'll take you.
p1912
aVJames, take this boy to the\u000akitchen, and give him some supper.
p1913
aVThen tell him what's to be done.
p1914
aVWhat's your name, boy?"
p1915
aV"Tony Rugg."
p1916
aV"Very well, Tony, I'll give you three dollars a week and your board as\u000along as we suit each other."
p1917
aV"I've got into business sooner than I expected," thought Tony.
p1918
aVThe hostler set him to work in the barn, and though he was new to the\u000awork, he quickly understood what was wanted, and did it.
p1919
aV"You work twice as fast as Sam," said the hostler, approvingly.
p1920
aV"Won't Sam be mad when he finds I have taken his place?"
p1921
aVasked Tony.
p1922
aV"Probably he will, but it's his own fault."
p1923
aV"Not if he's sick."
p1924
aV"He's no more sick than I am.
p1925
aVHe only wants to get a day or two off."
p1926
aV"Well, I'm glad he left a vacancy for me," said Tony.
p1927
aV"Where did you work last?"
p1928
aVasked the hostler.
p1929
aV"Nowhere."
p1930
aV"Never worked?
p1931
aVThen how did you live?"
p1932
aV"I traveled with my guardian."
p1933
aV"Were you rich?"
p1934
aVasked James, rather impressed by Tony's answer.
p1935
aV"No; I just went round and lived as I could.
p1936
aVI didn't like it, but I\u000acouldn't help it.
p1937
aVI had to go where Rudolph chose to lead me."
p1938
aV"Where is he now?"
p1939
aV"I don't know.
p1940
aVI got tired of being a tramp, and ran away from him."
p1941
aV"You did right," said James, who was a steady man, and looked forward\u000ato a snug home of his own ere long.
p1942
aV"All the same, Mr. Porter wouldn't\u000ahave taken you if he had known you were a tramp."
p1943
aV"I hope you won't tell him, then.
p1944
aVI don't want to be a tramp any\u000alonger."
p1945
aV"No; I won't tell him.
p1946
aVI want you to stay here.
p1947
aVI'd rather have you\u000athan Sam."
p1948
aV"Thank you.
p1949
aVI'll try to suit."
p1950
aVTony was assigned to a room in the attic.
p1951
aVThere were two beds in this\u000achamber, one being occupied by James.
p1952
aVHe slept soundly, and was up\u000abetimes in the morning.
p1953
aVAfter breakfast, Mr. Bickford, the tin peddler,\u000amade ready to start.
p1954
aV"Good-by, Tony," he said, in a friendly manner.
p1955
aV"I'm glad you've got a\u000aplace."
p1956
aV"I wouldn't have got it if I hadn't you to refer to," said Tony.
p1957
aV"The landlord didn't ask how long I'd known you," said Bickford,\u000asmiling.
p1958
aV"However, I guess I know enough of you to give you a\u000arecommend.
p1959
aVGood luck to you."
p1960
aVAs the peddler drove away, Tony noticed a big, overgrown boy, who was\u000ajust entering the hotel yard.
p1961
aV"That's Sam," said the hostler.
p1962
aV"He don't know he's lost his place."
p1963
aVCHAPTER XIV.
p1964
aVTONY'S RIVAL.
p1965
aVSam was about two inches taller than Tony, red haired and freckled,\u000awith a big frame, loosely put together.
p1966
aVHe was a born bully; and many\u000awere the tricks he had played on smaller boys in the village.
p1967
aVHe liked\u000ahis place at the hotel because he was no longer obliged to go to\u000aschool; but he was too lazy to fulfill the duties satisfactorily.
p1968
aVHis\u000afather was a blacksmith, of surly disposition, very much like Sam's,\u000awho was generally believed to ill-treat his wife, a meek, uncomplaining\u000awoman, who filled the position of a household drudge.
p1969
aVSam strutted into the yard with the air of a proprietor.
p1970
aVHe took no\u000aparticular notice of Tony, but accosted James.
p1971
aVThe latter made a signal\u000ato Tony to be silent.
p1972
aV"Well, have you just got along?"
p1973
aVasked the hostler.
p1974
aV"Ye-es," drawled Sam.
p1975
aV"What made you go home yesterday afternoon, and not come back?"
p1976
aV"I didn't feel well," said Sam, nonchalantly.
p1977
aV"What was the matter with you?"
p1978
aV"I had a sort of headache."
p1979
aV"Do you think Mr. Porter can afford to pay you wages and let you go\u000ahome three times a week in the middle of the afternoon?"
p1980
aV"I couldn't work when I was sick of course," said Sam.
p1981
aV"You're mighty delicate, getting sick two or three times a week."
p1982
aV"Couldn't help it," said Sam, unconcerned.
p1983
aV"I suppose you have come to work this morning?"
p1984
aV"Ye-es, but I can't work very hard--I ain't quite got over my headache."
p1985
aV"Then you'll be glad to hear that you won't have to work at all."
p1986
aV"Ain't there anything to do?"
p1987
aVasked Sam, with an air of relief.
p1988
aV"Yes, there's plenty to do, but your services ain't required.
p1989
aVYou're\u000adischarged!"
p1990
aV"What!"
p1991
aVexclaimed Sam, his eyes lighting up with anger.
p1992
aV"Mr. Porter's got tired of your delicate health; it interferes too much\u000awith business.
p1993
aVHe's got a tougher boy to take your place."
p1994
aV"Where is he?"
p1995
aVdemanded Sam, with an ominous frown.
p1996
aV"There," answered the hostler, pointing out our hero, who stood quietly\u000alistening to the conversation.
p1997
aVSam regarded Tony with a contemptuous scowl.
p1998
aVSo this was the boy\u000awho had superseded him.
p1999
aVHe hated him already for his presumption in\u000aventuring to take his place.
p2000
aV"Who are you?"
p2001
aVhe demanded, roughly.
p2002
aV"Your successor," answered Tony, coolly.
p2003
aVHe knew that his answer would make Sam very angry, but he was not\u000aafraid of him, and felt under no particular obligations to be polite.
p2004
aV"You won't be my successor long," retorted Sam.
p2005
aV"Why not?"
p2006
aV"What business had you to take my place?"
p2007
aV"The landlord hired me."
p2008
aV"I don't care if he did.
p2009
aVHe hired me first."
p2010
aV"Then you'd better go to him and complain about it.
p2011
aVIt's none of my\u000abusiness----"\u000a\u000a"It's _my_ business," said Sam, with emphasis.
p2012
aV"Just as you like."
p2013
aV"Will you give up the place?"
p2014
aV"No," said Tony.
p2015
aV"You must think I'm a fool.
p2016
aVWhat should I give it up\u000afor?"
p2017
aV"Because it belongs to me."
p2018
aV"I don't see that; I suppose Mr. Porter has a right to hire anybody he\u000alikes."
p2019
aV"He had no right to give you my place."
p2020
aV"That's his business.
p2021
aVWhat shall I do next, James?"
p2022
aV"Go to the barn and shake down some hay for the horses."
p2023
aV"All right."
p2024
aVSam walked off, deeply incensed, muttering threats of vengeance against\u000aTony.
p2025
aVThree days later a boy entered the stable, and calling for Tony,\u000apresented the following missive:\u000a\u000a\u000a     "If you ain't a coward, meet me to-morrow night at seven o'clock,\u000a     back of the school house, and we'll settle, by fighting, which\u000a     shall have the place, you or I.
p2026
aVIf you get whipped, you must clear\u000a     out, and leave it to me.
p2027
aV"SAM PAYSON."
p2028
aVTony showed the note to the hostler.
p2029
aV"Well, Tony, what are you going to do about it?"
p2030
aVasked James, curiously.
p2031
aV"I'll be on hand," said Tony, promptly.
p2032
aV"He won't find it so easy to\u000awhip me as he thinks."
p2033
aVCHAPTER XV.
p2034
aVTHE BOYS' DUEL.
p2035
aVSam Payson felt perfectly safe in challenging Tony to single combat.
p2036
aVHe\u000ahad measured him with his eye, and seen that he was two inches shorter,\u000aand probably twenty pounds lighter.
p2037
aVBut appearances were deceitful, and\u000ahe had no idea that Tony had received special training, which he lacked.
p2038
aVThis was the way it had happened:\u000a\u000aIn the course of his extensive wanderings, Tony had attracted the\u000aattention of a certain pugilist who was a friend of Rudolph.
p2039
aV"I'll tell you what, Rudolph," said the pugilist, "you can make\u000asomething of that boy."
p2040
aV"How?"
p2041
aVasked the tramp.
p2042
aV"I'll teach him to box, and you can get an engagement for him in a\u000acircus."
p2043
aV"Do it if you like," said the tramp.
p2044
aV"It won't do him any harm."
p2045
aVSo Tony received a gratuitous course of lessons in boxing, which were\u000aat last interrupted by a little difficulty between his teacher and the\u000aofficers of the law, resulting in the temporary confinement of the\u000aformer.
p2046
aVThe lessons were never resumed, but they had gone so far that\u000aTony was quite a skillful boxer for a boy.
p2047
aVHe, too, had measured Sam, and felt quite sure of being able to conquer\u000ahim, and that with ease.
p2048
aVHe did not, however, mention the grounds of\u000ahis confidence to James, when the latter expressed some apprehension\u000athat he would find Sam too much for him.
p2049
aV"Don't be alarmed, James," said Tony, quietly.
p2050
aV"I'm enough for him."
p2051
aV"He's bigger than you," said James.
p2052
aV"I know that, but he's clumsy."
p2053
aV"He's slow, but he's pretty strong."
p2054
aV"So am I."
p2055
aV"You've got pluck, and you deserve to beat, Tony," said his friend.
p2056
aV"I mean to," answered Tony.
p2057
aV"Come along and see that it's all fair."
p2058
aV"I will if I can get away.
p2059
aVWill you give up your place if you are\u000alicked?"
p2060
aV"Yes," replied Tony, "I'll give up my place and leave the village."
p2061
aV"I don't believe Mr. Porter will take Sam back."
p2062
aV"I see you are expecting I will be whipped," said Tony, laughing; "but\u000ayou're mistaken.
p2063
aVSam isn't able to do it."
p2064
aVJames feared that Tony overestimated his prowess, but earnestly hoped\u000athat the boy, in whom he already felt a strong interest, would achieve\u000athe victory.
p2065
aVMeanwhile, Sam had made known the duel which was about to take place.
p2066
aVHe confidently anticipated victory, and wanted the village boys to\u000abe witnesses of the manner in which he was going to polish off that\u000ainterloper.
p2067
aV"I'll learn him to cut me out of my place," he said, boastfully; "I'll\u000alearn him to mind his own business."
p2068
aV"Will you get your place again if you lick him?"
p2069
aVasked one of his\u000acompanions.
p2070
aV"Of course I will."
p2071
aV"Suppose he won't give it up?"
p2072
aV"Then I'll lick him every day till he's glad to clear out.
p2073
aVAll you boys\u000aknow I don't stand no nonsense."
p2074
aVThe result of Sam's boastful talk was that about a hundred boys\u000acollected about the school house to witness the boys' duel.
p2075
aVMany of them who had suffered from Sam's bullying disposition would\u000ahave been glad to see him worsted, but none anticipated it.
p2076
aVNothing was known of Tony except that he was considerably smaller and\u000alighter, and probably weaker.
p2077
aVIt was generally thought that he would\u000anot be able to hold out long, and that Sam would achieve an easy\u000avictory.
p2078
aVTony tried to be on hand at the time appointed, but he had more than\u000ausual to do, and it was five minutes past seven when he entered the\u000afield, accompanied by James.
p2079
aVThere had been various speculations as to the cause of his delay.
p2080
aV"He won't come," said Sam, with a sneer; "he's afraid."
p2081
aV"What'll you do if he don't come?"
p2082
aVasked John Nolan.
p2083
aV"What will I do?
p2084
aVI'll pitch into him wherever I see him."
p2085
aV"Didn't he accept your challenge?"
p2086
aV"Yes, he accepted, but he's thought better of it, likely."
p2087
aV"There he comes!"
p2088
aVshouted a small boy.
p2089
aVAll eyes were turned upon Tony, as he entered the field, with James at\u000ahis side.
p2090
aV"I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, boys," said our hero, politely.
p2091
aV"We concluded you'd backed out," said Sam, with a sneer.
p2092
aV"That isn't my style," returned Tony, with a quiet smile.
p2093
aV"I had more\u000ato do than usual to-night."
p2094
aV"You've still more to do," said Sam, jeeringly.
p2095
aV"I pity you."
p2096
aV"Do you?
p2097
aVYou're very kind," said Tony, unmoved.
p2098
aV"Oh, don't thank me too soon."
p2099
aV"Then I won't.
p2100
aVWhen are the exercises to commence?"
p2101
aV"He takes it cool," said Nolan.
p2102
aV"Oh, it's only show off," said Sam.
p2103
aV"You'll see how he'll wilt down\u000awhen I get hold of him."
p2104
aVThe two boys stripped off coat and vest, and faced each other.
p2105
aVTony was\u000awary and watchful, and quietly looked into the eyes of his adversary,\u000ashowing no disposition to begin.
p2106
aVSam began business by thrusting his right fist violently in his face,\u000aor rather trying to do so.
p2107
aVWith scarcely an effort Tony parried the\u000ablow, and returned it quick as lightning, striking Sam full in the nose.
p2108
aVSam was not only maddened, but disagreeably surprised, especially when\u000ahe discovered that blood was trickling from the injured organ.
p2109
aVHe was\u000astill more incensed by the murmur of applause which followed from the\u000acrowd of boys.
p2110
aVHad the applause been elicited by his success, he would\u000ahave enjoyed it, but now it was quite a different matter.
p2111
aVHe breathed an audible curse, and, losing all prudence, began to let\u000adrive at Tony with each fist in rapid succession, with the intention\u000aof overpowering him.
p2112
aVBut, unfortunately for him, this exposed him to\u000aattack, and a couple of forcible blows in his face warned him that this\u000awas too dangerous.
p2113
aVTony stood upright, as cool and collected as at first.
p2114
aVHe had warded\u000aoff every blow of his adversary, and thus far was untouched.
p2115
aVThere was a murmur of surprise among the boys.
p2116
aVThey had come to see\u000aTony used up, and all the using up had proved to be from the other\u000aside.
p2117
aVJames was as much delighted as surprised.
p2118
aVHe could not repress\u000aclapping his hands, a movement which was quickly imitated by the boys.
p2119
aV"Tony knows how to take care of himself," he thought.
p2120
aV"That's why he\u000atook matters so coolly.
p2121
aVI didn't half believe him when he told me there\u000awas no danger."
p2122
aVSam felt humiliated and maddened.
p2123
aVHe regretted now that he had\u000aundertaken a task which seemed every moment more formidable.
p2124
aVWhat!
p2125
aVwas\u000ait possible that he, Sam Payson, the crack fighter of the village, was\u000abeing ignominiously whipped, and that by a smaller boy.
p2126
aVHe felt that if\u000ahe permitted this his prestige would be forever gone, and with it the\u000ainfluence which he so much prized.
p2127
aVHe must make one desperate effort.
p2128
aV"If I can only get hold of him," he thought, "I can shake the life out\u000aof him."
p2129
aVHe tried to grasp Tony round the body, intending to throw him violently\u000adown upon the ground; but our hero was too quick for him, and showered\u000athe blows upon him with such rapidity that, blinded and overwhelmed,\u000aSam himself fell on his back.
p2130
aVInstead of following up the victory, Tony drew off and let his\u000aadversary rise.
p2131
aVSam renewed the attack so wildly that in two minutes he\u000awas again lying flat.
p2132
aV"That's enough, Sam!
p2133
aVYou're whipped," shouted the boys.
p2134
aVBut Sam was not convinced.
p2135
aVHe renewed the attack once more, but there\u000awas no hope for him now.
p2136
aVHe got up sullenly, and, in a voice nearly choked with rage, said:\u000a\u000a"I'll be even with you yet, see if I don't."
p2137
aV"Hurrah for the stranger!"
p2138
aVshouted the boys enthusiastically, as they\u000acrowded around our hero.
p2139
aV"Boys," said Tony, modestly, "I'm much obliged to you for your\u000acongratulations.
p2140
aVWas it a fair fight?"
p2141
aV"Yes, yes."
p2142
aV"Then it's all right.
p2143
aVDon't say anything to him about it.
p2144
aVHe feels bad,\u000aas I should do in his place.
p2145
aVI haven't any ill will toward him, and I\u000ahope he hasn't toward me."
p2146
aVThis speech made Tony a still greater favorite and the boys, making a\u000arush, took him on their shoulders, and bore him in triumph to the inn.
p2147
aVPoor Sam slunk home, suffering keener mortification than he had ever\u000abefore experienced in his life.
p2148
aVCHAPTER XVI.
p2149
aVRUDOLPH ESCAPES AND SEES AN ADVERTISEMENT.
p2150
aVLeaving Tony for a short time, we must return to Rudolph, whom we\u000aleft in charge of a self-constituted body of police on his way to the\u000astation-house.
p2151
aVOf course there was no regular prison in the village.
p2152
aVThere was not\u000aproperly even a station-house.
p2153
aVBut under the engine house was a\u000abasement room, which was used as a lock-up.
p2154
aVIt was not often used, for\u000afew rogues of a serious character disturbed the tranquility of the\u000avillage.
p2155
aVOccasionally a man was put in who had disturbed the peace\u000awhile under the influence of liquor, but even such cases were rare.
p2156
aVWhen first arrested Rudolph was disposed to be violent and abusive.
p2157
aVHis disappointment was keen, for he was just congratulating himself on\u000athe possession of the miser's gold.
p2158
aVFive minutes later, and he would\u000aprobably have been able to make good his escape.
p2159
aVMingled with his\u000adisappointment was a feeling of intense hostility against Tony for his\u000apart in defeating his plans.
p2160
aV"I'll be revenged upon him yet," he muttered between his teeth.
p2161
aV"What did you say?"
p2162
aVasked one of his captors.
p2163
aV"Nothing," answered Rudolph.
p2164
aV"I thought I heard you say something."
p2165
aV"I said I was tired."
p2166
aV"Then you will have a chance to rest in the lock-up."
p2167
aVRudolph frowned, but said nothing.
p2168
aVThey reached the lockup.
p2169
aVThe door was opened, and he was led in.
p2170
aVA\u000asmall oil lamp was lighted, and set on the floor.
p2171
aV"Where are the handcuffs?"
p2172
aVasked one of the captors.
p2173
aV"I don't know.
p2174
aVThey haven't been needed for so long that they have been\u000amislaid."
p2175
aV"They won't be needed now.
p2176
aVThe man can't get out."
p2177
aVRudolph's face betrayed satisfaction, but he thought it prudent to say\u000anothing.
p2178
aV"There's your bed," says Moses Hunt, who had Rudolph by the arm,\u000apointing to a rude cot in the corner.
p2179
aVRudolph threw himself upon it.
p2180
aV"I'm dead tired," he said, and closed his eyes.
p2181
aV"He'll be quiet enough.
p2182
aVWe can leave him alone," said Hunt.
p2183
aV"All right."
p2184
aVThe door was locked, and Rudolph was left alone.
p2185
aVWhen five minutes had elapsed--time enough for his captors to get\u000aaway--he rose in bed, and looked about him.
p2186
aVBeside the bed in which he was lying there was no other furniture in\u000athe room than a wooden chair.
p2187
aVHe got up and walked about.
p2188
aV"I must get away from this if I can," thought the tramp, "and before\u000amorning.
p2189
aVI am glad they didn't put on handcuffs.
p2190
aVLet me see, how shall\u000aI manage it."
p2191
aVHe looked about him thoughtfully.
p2192
aVIt was a basement room, lighted only by windows three feet wide and a\u000afoot high in the upper part of the room.
p2193
aV"I should like to set fire to the building, and burn it up," thought\u000athe tramp.
p2194
aV"That would cost them something.
p2195
aVBut it wouldn't be safe.
p2196
aVLike as not I would be burnt up myself, or, at any rate, be taken again\u000ain getting away.
p2197
aVNo, no; that won't do."
p2198
aV"I wonder if I can get through one of those windows?"
p2199
aVwas the next\u000athought that came into his mind.
p2200
aVHe stood on the chair, and as the room was low-slatted he found he\u000acould easily reach the windows in question.
p2201
aVHe shook them, and found to his joy that it would be a comparatively\u000aeasy thing to remove one of them.
p2202
aV"What fools they are," he muttered contemptuously.
p2203
aV"Did they really\u000aexpect to keep me here.
p2204
aVThey must think I am a green hand."
p2205
aVHe removed the window, and by great effort succeeded in raising himself\u000aso that he might have a chance of drawing himself through the aperture.
p2206
aVIt did not prove so easy as he expected.
p2207
aVHe did, however, succeed at\u000alength, and drew a long breath of satisfaction as he found himself\u000aonce more in the possession of his liberty.
p2208
aV"I'm a free man once more," he said.
p2209
aV"What next?"
p2210
aVHe would have been glad to return to the miser's house, and possessed\u000ahimself of some of his gold, but the faint gray of dawn was already\u000aperceptible, and there was too much risk attending it.
p2211
aVHe felt that\u000athis must be deferred to a more fitting occasion.
p2212
aVA few days later the tramp found himself in the streets of New York.
p2213
aVFor the time he had given up the pursuit of Tony.
p2214
aVIndeed, he had wholly\u000alost the clew.
p2215
aVMoreover, prudence dictated his putting as great a\u000adistance as possible between himself and the village where he had been\u000aarrested.
p2216
aVThe hundred miles intervening between New York and that place he had\u000agot over in his usual way, begging a meal at one house, and a night's\u000alodging at another.
p2217
aVHe was never at a loss for a plausible story.
p2218
aVAt\u000aone place where he was evidently looked upon with suspicion, he said:\u000a\u000a"I ain't used to beggin'.
p2219
aVI'm a poor, hard-workin' man, but I've heard\u000athat my poor daughter is sick in New York, and she's in the hospital.
p2220
aVPoor girl!
p2221
aVI'm afraid she'll suffer."
p2222
aV"What took her to New York?"
p2223
aVasked the farmer whom he addressed.
p2224
aV"She went to take a place in a store," said Rudolph readily, "but she's\u000abeen taken sick, and she's in the hospital.
p2225
aVPoor girl!
p2226
aVI'm afraid\u000ashe'll suffer."
p2227
aV"I'm sorry for you," said the farmer's wife, sympathizingly.
p2228
aV"Ephraim,\u000acan't we help along this poor man?"
p2229
aV"If we can believe him.
p2230
aVThere's many impostors about."
p2231
aV"I hope you don't take me for one," said Rudolph, meekly.
p2232
aV"Poor Jane;\u000awhat would she think if she knew how poor father was so misunderstood."
p2233
aV"Poor man!
p2234
aVI believe you," said the farmer's wife.
p2235
aV"You shall sleep in\u000aJonathan's bed.
p2236
aVHe's away now."
p2237
aVSo Rudolph was provided with two abundant meals and a comfortable bed.
p2238
aVThe farmer's wife never doubted his story, though she could not help\u000afeeling that his looks were not prepossessing.
p2239
aVBut, was her charitable\u000athought, the poor man can't help his looks.
p2240
aVOf course Rudolph had been in New York often, and his familiar haunts.
p2241
aVAs a general thing, however, he shunned the city, for he was already\u000aknown to the police, and he felt that watchful eyes would be upon him\u000aas soon as it was known that he was back again.
p2242
aVOn the second day he strolled into a low drinking place in the lower\u000apart of the city.
p2243
aVA man in shirt sleeves, and with unhealthy complexion, was mixing\u000adrinks behind the bar.
p2244
aV"Hallo, Rudolph!
p2245
aVBack again?"
p2246
aVwas his salutation.
p2247
aV"Yes," said the tramp, throwing himself down in a seat.
p2248
aV"What's the news with you?
p2249
aVBeen prospering?"
p2250
aV"No."
p2251
aV"Where have you been?"
p2252
aV"Tramping round the country."
p2253
aV"Where's the boy you used to have with you?"
p2254
aV"Run away; curse him!"
p2255
aVreturned the tramp with a fierce scowl.
p2256
aV"Got tired of your company, eh?"
p2257
aV"He wants to be honest and respectable," answered Rudolph, with a sneer.
p2258
aV"And he thought he could learn better under another teacher, did he?"
p2259
aVsaid the bartender, with a laugh.
p2260
aV"Yes, I suppose so.
p2261
aVI'd like to wring his neck," muttered the tramp.
p2262
aV"You're no friend to the honest and respectable, then?"
p2263
aV"No, I'm not."
p2264
aV"Then, there's no love lost, for they don't seem to fancy you.
p2265
aVWhat'll\u000ayou have to drink?"
p2266
aV"I've got no money."
p2267
aV"I'll trust.
p2268
aVYou'll have some some time?"
p2269
aV"Give me some whisky, then," said the tramp.
p2270
aVThe whisky was placed in his hands.
p2271
aVHe gulped it down, and breathed a\u000asigh of satisfaction.
p2272
aVThen resuming his seat, he took up a morning paper.
p2273
aVAt first he read it\u000alistlessly, but soon his face assumed a look of eager interest.
p2274
aVThis was the paragraph that arrested his attention:\u000a\u000a"Should this meet the eye of Rudolph Rugg, who left England in the\u000afall of 1857, he is requested to communicate with Jacob Morris,\u000aattorney-at-law, Room 11, No.
p2275
aV--, Nassau street."
p2276
aVRudolph rose hurriedly.
p2277
aV"Going?"
p2278
aVasked the bartender.
p2279
aV"Yes; I'll be back again soon."
p2280
aVCHAPTER XVII.
p2281
aVTHE LADY AT THE ST. NICHOLAS.
p2282
aVWhen Rudolph reached the sidewalk he stopped a moment to reflect on the\u000aprobable meaning of the advertisement.
p2283
aV"Perhaps it is a trap," he thought.
p2284
aV"Perhaps, after so many years, they\u000awant to punish me.
p2285
aVShall I go?"
p2286
aVHis hesitation was only temporary.
p2287
aV"There's nothing to be afraid of," he concluded.
p2288
aV"Very likely I shall\u000ahear something to my advantage.
p2289
aVI will go."
p2290
aVTen minutes' walk brought him to Nassau street.
p2291
aVHe ascended two flights\u000aof stairs, opened the door of No.
p2292
aV--, and found himself in a lawyer's\u000aoffice.
p2293
aVA tall man of forty was seated at a desk, with some papers and\u000abooks lying before him.
p2294
aV"Well," he said inquiringly, "what can I do for you, sir?"
p2295
aVThe address was not very cordial, for Rudolph did not have the look of\u000aone likely to be a profitable client.
p2296
aV"Are you Mr. Jacob Morris, attorney-at-law?"
p2297
aVasked the tramp.
p2298
aV"That is my name."
p2299
aV"I am Rudolph Rugg."
p2300
aV"Rudolph Rugg!"
p2301
aVexclaimed the lawyer, briskly, jumping from his chair,\u000a"you don't say so.
p2302
aVI am very glad to see you.
p2303
aVTake a chair, please."
p2304
aVReassured by this reception, Rudolph took the seat indicated.
p2305
aV"So you saw my advertisement?"
p2306
aVsaid the lawyer, brushing away the\u000apapers with which he had been occupied.
p2307
aV"Yes, sir.
p2308
aVI only saw it this morning."
p2309
aV"It has been inserted for the last two weeks, daily.
p2310
aVHow happens it\u000athat you did not see it sooner?"
p2311
aV"I have been away from the city.
p2312
aVI have been traveling.
p2313
aVIt was only an\u000aaccident that I happened to see it to-day."
p2314
aV"A lucky accident, Mr.
p2315
aVRugg."
p2316
aV"I hope it is, sir, for I have been out of luck myself, and I've been\u000ahoping something would turn up for me.
p2317
aVWhat is the business, sir?"
p2318
aV"My business has been to find you.
p2319
aVI can't say anything more."
p2320
aV"To find me?"
p2321
aV"Yes."
p2322
aV"What for?"
p2323
aV"For a client of mine--an English lady."
p2324
aV"A lady?"
p2325
aVejaculated the tramp, with unconcealed surprise.
p2326
aV"Yes."
p2327
aV"Who is it?"
p2328
aV"I suppose I am at liberty to tell.
p2329
aVThe lady is Mrs. Harvey Middleton,\u000aof Middleton Hall, England."
p2330
aVA peculiar expression swept over Rudolph's face, but he only said:\u000a\u000a"I have heard the name of Harvey Middleton.
p2331
aVIs--is the lady in New\u000aYork?"
p2332
aV"Yes; she is staying at the St. Nicholas Hotel."
p2333
aV"And she wants to find me?"
p2334
aV"Yes, she authorized me to seek you out?"
p2335
aV"Well," said Rudolph, after a brief pause, "I'm found.
p2336
aVWhat next?"
p2337
aV"I shall at once send a messenger to Mrs. Middleton, and await her\u000aorders.
p2338
aVYou will stay here."
p2339
aVHe went to the door and called "John," in a loud voice.
p2340
aV"Look here," said Rudolph, suspiciously, "just tell me one thing.
p2341
aVThere\u000aain't any trap is there?"
p2342
aV"Trap, my good friend?
p2343
aVWhat can you possibly mean?"
p2344
aV"You ain't sending for the police?"
p2345
aV"To be sure not.
p2346
aVBesides, why should a gentleman like you fear the\u000apolice?"
p2347
aV"Oh, that's all gammon.
p2348
aVI do fear the police uncommon.
p2349
aVBut if you tell\u000ame it's all on the square, I'll believe you."
p2350
aV"On my honor, then, it's all on the square, as you call it.
p2351
aVNo harm\u000awhatever is designed you.
p2352
aVIndeed, I have reason to think that you will\u000amake considerable money out of it.
p2353
aVNow, hark ye, my friend, a word in\u000aconfidence.
p2354
aVWe can do each other good."
p2355
aV"Can we?"
p2356
aVasked the tramp, surveying the lawyer, in surprise.
p2357
aV"Yes, and I'll tell you how.
p2358
aVThis lady, Mrs. Middleton, appears to be\u000arich."
p2359
aV"She is rich."
p2360
aV"So much the better for us.
p2361
aVI mean to give her the idea that I have\u000abeen at great trouble and expense in finding you."
p2362
aV"I see," said Rudolph, smiling.
p2363
aV"You mean to charge it in the bill."
p2364
aV"Of course, I shall represent that I sent out messengers in search of\u000ayou, and you were found by one of them."
p2365
aV"Very good."
p2366
aV"So you need not say anything about the advertisement."
p2367
aV"All right, sir."
p2368
aV"Grant me a moment while I pencil a note to the lady."
p2369
aV*       *       *       *       *       *       *\u000a\u000aIn a private parlor at the St. Nicholas sat a lady of middle age.
p2370
aVShe\u000ahad a haughty face, and stern, compressed lips.
p2371
aVShe was one to repel\u000arather than to attract.
p2372
aVShe had a note before her, which she threw down\u000awith an exclamation of impatience.
p2373
aV"So he has heard nothing yet.
p2374
aVFor three weeks I have been wasting\u000amy time at this hotel, depending on this lawyer, and he has done\u000aabsolutely nothing.
p2375
aVAnd the issue is so important.
p2376
aVI may have to employ\u000aanother person, and that will be a fresh bill of expense."
p2377
aVAt this moment a light knock was heard at the door.
p2378
aV"Enter," said the lady.
p2379
aV"A note for Mrs. Middleton," announced a servant.
p2380
aVShe took the missive and hastily opened it.
p2381
aVIt read thus:\u000a\u000a\u000a     "MY DEAR MADAM--At last, after unwearied exertions, I\u000a     have succeeded.
p2382
aVThe man, Rudolph Rugg, has been found by one of my\u000a     messengers, and is at this moment in my office, ready to obey your\u000a     summons.
p2383
aVShall I send him to you?
p2384
aV"Yours, respectfully,\u000a     "JACOB MORRIS."
p2385
aV"P. S.--I assured you at the outset that if he were living I would\u000a     find him.
p2386
aVI am sure you will appreciate my exertions in your\u000a     behalf."
p2387
aV"That means a larger bill," thought the lady.
p2388
aV"However, I am willing to\u000apay handsomely.
p2389
aVThe man is found, and he can, doubtless, produce the\u000aboy."
p2390
aV"Wait!"
p2391
aVshe said, in an imperious tone, to the servant, who was about\u000ato withdraw.
p2392
aV"There is an answer."
p2393
aVShe hastily penciled the following note:\u000a\u000a"I am very glad you have found Rudolph Rugg.
p2394
aVI wish to speak to him at\u000aonce.
p2395
aVSend him here directly."
p2396
aV"Short and not sweet!"
p2397
aVcommented the lawyer, when it was placed in his\u000ahands.
p2398
aV"She says nothing about the compensation."
p2399
aV"Is it about me?"
p2400
aVasked the tramp, watching the lawyer's face eagerly.
p2401
aV"Yes; it is from Mrs. Middleton.
p2402
aVShe wants you to come to the hotel at\u000aonce.
p2403
aVBut, my friend, if you will excuse the suggestion, I would advise\u000ayou, since you are about to call upon a lady, to put on a better suit\u000aof clothes."
p2404
aVThe tramp scowled at the hint.
p2405
aV"How am I to do it," he demanded roughly, "when these are all the\u000aclothes I have?"
p2406
aVThe lawyer whistled.
p2407
aV"A pretty looking figure to call upon a lady at a fashionable hotel!"
p2408
aVhe thought.
p2409
aV"You must go as you are," he said.
p2410
aV"Wait a minute."
p2411
aVHe took a blank card and wrote upon it the name:\u000a\u000a\u000a     RUDOLPH RUGG.
p2412
aV"When you reach the hotel," he said, "inquire for Mrs. Middleton, and\u000asend that card up to her."
p2413
aV"Very well, sir."
p2414
aVThe tramp started for the hotel, his mind busily occupied.
p2415
aV"What does she want with me?
p2416
aVShe wasn't Mrs. Middleton when I knew her;\u000ashe was Miss Vincent, the governess.
p2417
aVI suppose she's a great lady now.
p2418
aVSo she got Mr. Harvey to marry her.
p2419
aVThat ain't surprisin'.
p2420
aVShe looked\u000alike a schemer even then, and I was a fool not to see what she was at.
p2421
aVLikely she was up to the other thing.
p2422
aVWell, I shall soon know."
p2423
aVCHAPTER XVIII.
p2424
aVTWO CONSPIRATORS.
p2425
aV"You want to see Mrs.
p2426
aVMiddleton?"
p2427
aVdemanded the hotel clerk, surveying\u000aMr. Rugg's exterior with a glance which betokened suspicion.
p2428
aV"Yes," said the tramp.
p2429
aV"I don't think she'll see one of your sort."
p2430
aV"That's where you're mistaken, young feller," said Rudolph, loftily.
p2431
aV"She wants to see me uncommon."
p2432
aV"You're a strange visitor for a lady."
p2433
aV"What if I am?
p2434
aVThere's my card.
p2435
aVJust you send it up, and see if she\u000awon't see me."
p2436
aVThe clerk took the card, and looked at it doubtfully.
p2437
aVThen summoning an\u000aattendant, he said:\u000a\u000a"Take this up to 57."
p2438
aVPresently the servant returned.
p2439
aV"The gentleman is to go up," he said.
p2440
aVRudolph looked at the clerk triumphantly.
p2441
aV"What did I tell you?"
p2442
aVhe said.
p2443
aV"Show the _gentleman_ up," said the clerk, purposely emphasizing the\u000aword.
p2444
aVAs Rudolph entered the handsome parlor occupied by Mrs. Middleton, she\u000asaid:\u000a\u000a"Take a seat, sir."
p2445
aVThen to the attendant: "You may go.
p2446
aVYou are Rudolph\u000aRugg?"
p2447
aVshe commenced when they were alone.
p2448
aV"Yes, ma'am," he answered; "and you are Miss Vincent, the governess.
p2449
aVI\u000ahaven't forgotten you."
p2450
aV"I am Mrs. Harvey Middleton," she said haughtily.
p2451
aV"Excuse me, ma'am.
p2452
aVI hadn't heard as you had changed your condition.
p2453
aVYou was the governess when I knowed you."
p2454
aV"You never knew me," she said, in the same haughty tone.
p2455
aV"Well, I knowed Mr. Harvey, at any rate."
p2456
aV"That is not to the purpose.
p2457
aVDo you know why I have sought you out?"
p2458
aV"I couldn't guess, ma'am," said Rudolph, cunningly.
p2459
aVHe could guess, but he wanted to force her to speak out.
p2460
aV"Where is the boy?
p2461
aVIs he living?"
p2462
aVshe demanded, eagerly.
p2463
aV"What boy?"
p2464
aVasked Rudolph, vacantly.
p2465
aV"You know very well.
p2466
aVRobert Middleton, my husband's cousin, whom you\u000astole away when he was scarcely more than an infant."
p2467
aV"Can you prove what you say, Miss Vincent--I mean Mrs.
p2468
aVMiddleton?"
p2469
aV"Yes.
p2470
aVIt is idle to beat about the bush.
p2471
aVMy husband has told me all."
p2472
aV"Then he has told you that he hired me to carry the boy off, in order\u000athat he might inherit the estate?"
p2473
aVThe tramp looked searchingly in the lady's face as he said this.
p2474
aV"Yes, he told me that," she answered, composedly.
p2475
aV"Well, I didn't think he'd own up to that," said the tramp, in surprise.
p2476
aV"My husband and I had no secrets," said the lady, coldly.
p2477
aV"What does he want of the boy now?"
p2478
aVasked Rudolph.
p2479
aV"It is I that want to find the boy."
p2480
aV"Without his knowledge?"
p2481
aV"If you refer to my husband, he is dead."
p2482
aV"Dead!
p2483
aVYou don't say so?"
p2484
aV"He died six months ago."
p2485
aV"Well, I didn't expect that.
p2486
aVWho has got the estate?"
p2487
aV"I have."
p2488
aVThe tramp whistled, and surveyed the lady with genuine admiration.
p2489
aVHere\u000awas a poor governess, who had succeeded in life with a vengeance.
p2490
aVWhen\u000ahe knew her she was not worth fifty pounds in the world.
p2491
aVNow she was a\u000amistress of a fine English estate, with a rental of two thousand pounds.
p2492
aV"Wasn't there no heirs?"
p2493
aVhe asked.
p2494
aV"Only this boy."
p2495
aV"And if this boy was alive would the estate be his?"
p2496
aVThe lady paused, meanwhile fixing her eyes steadily upon the man before\u000aher.
p2497
aVThen, as if rapidly making up her mind, she approached him, and\u000aplaced her jeweled hand on his arm.
p2498
aV"Rudolph Rugg," she said, "do you want to be comfortable for life?"
p2499
aV"Yes, ma'am, that's exactly what I do want.
p2500
aVI've been wanting it ever\u000asince I was old enough to know the power of money, but it has never\u000acome to me."
p2501
aV"It will come to you now if you say the word," she said.
p2502
aV"I'll say it quick enough.
p2503
aVTell me what you want."
p2504
aV"You talk like a sensible man.
p2505
aVBut first tell me, is the boy living?"
p2506
aV"He is alive and well."
p2507
aVShe frowned slightly, as if the intelligence didn't please her.
p2508
aV"Do you know where he is?"
p2509
aV"Yes," answered Rudolph.
p2510
aVIt was false, of course, but he thought it was for his interest to\u000aanswer in the affirmative.
p2511
aV"When did you see him last?"
p2512
aV"Last week."
p2513
aV"Very well, you know where he is.
p2514
aVThat is important.
p2515
aVNow, in order that\u000ayou may understand what service I want of you, I must tell you a little\u000aof my circumstances.
p2516
aVI told you that my husband left me the estate."
p2517
aV"Yes, ma'am."
p2518
aV"But only in trust."
p2519
aV"For the boy?"
p2520
aVasked the tramp, in excitement.
p2521
aV"Precisely."
p2522
aV"Well, I'll be blowed."
p2523
aV"What excites you, Mr.
p2524
aVRugg?"
p2525
aV"To think that Tony, the tramp, should be the owner of a splendid\u000aestate in old Hingland, and not know anything about it."
p2526
aV"I am the owner," said the lady, frowning.
p2527
aV"But you're only takin' care of it for him."
p2528
aV"I don't mean that he shall ever know it."
p2529
aVRudolph whistled.
p2530
aV"I wish you would forbear whistling in the presence of a lady.
p2531
aVIt is\u000aunmannerly," said Mrs. Middleton, annoyed.
p2532
aV"I ain't much used to associating with ladies," said the tramp.
p2533
aV"Bear it in mind, then," she said, sharply.
p2534
aV"Now to business."
p2535
aV"Yes, ma'am, to business."
p2536
aV"My husband secured the inheritance, as you are aware, through the\u000adisappearance of his young cousin.
p2537
aVAnd mighty well he managed it.
p2538
aV"But after he fell into ill health, and was given over by the doctors,\u000ahe became a prey to superstitious fears, the result of his weakness,\u000aand at times experienced great regret for the hand he had in the\u000aabduction of the boy."
p2539
aV"You surprise me, ma'am.
p2540
aVHe wasn't that sort when I knew him."
p2541
aV"No; he was then in perfect health, and was bold and resolute.
p2542
aVIll\u000ahealth and the approach of death made him superstitious."
p2543
aV"You ain't that way, ma'am, I take it," said Rudolph, with a leer.
p2544
aV"No; I have a stronger will and greater resolution, I hope."
p2545
aVHer face did not belie her words.
p2546
aVThere was a cold look in her\u000alight-gray eyes, and a firmness in her closely-pressed lips, which made\u000ait clear that she was not likely to be affected by ordinary weakness.
p2547
aVShe was intensely selfish, and thoroughly unscrupulous as to the means\u000awhich she employed to carry out her selfish ends.
p2548
aV"So you're afraid the boy'll turn up, ma'am?"
p2549
aVasked Rudolph.
p2550
aV"Precisely."
p2551
aV"Then why do you look for him?"
p2552
aV"I want to guard against his ever turning up.
p2553
aVI hoped you would be able\u000ato tell me he was dead."
p2554
aV"He don't know about the property."
p2555
aV"But he might have learned, or you might.
p2556
aVMy husband, with the idea of\u000areparation, left the property to me, in trust, but if it should ever\u000abe fully ascertained that the boy had died, then it was to be mine\u000aabsolutely.
p2557
aVThere must be clear proof."
p2558
aV"I begin to see what you're driving at, ma'am."
p2559
aV"You say the boy is alive?"
p2560
aV"Yes, ma'am."
p2561
aV"And well?"
p2562
aV"Stout and hearty, ma'am.
p2563
aVHe's been under my care ever since he was a\u000ayoung 'un, ma'am, and I've treated him like he was my own."
p2564
aV"Indeed!"
p2565
aV"Yes, ma'am.
p2566
aVI'm poor, but I've always shared my crust with him, givin'\u000ahim the biggest half."
p2567
aV"Very kind, I'm sure," said the lady, sarcastically.
p2568
aV"I suppose you're\u000avery fond of him."
p2569
aV"Of course I am," said Rudolph, "but," he added, after a slight pause,\u000a"there's one thing I like better."
p2570
aV"What is that?"
p2571
aV"Money."
p2572
aV"Good!"
p2573
aVsaid the lady, her face lighting up with satisfaction.
p2574
aV"I see\u000awe understand one another."
p2575
aV"That's so, ma'am.
p2576
aVYou needn't be afraid to say anything to me.
p2577
aVBusiness is business."
p2578
aV"Draw your chair near mine, Mr. Rugg," said Mrs. Middleton, affably.
p2579
aVThe tramp did so.
p2580
aVHe foresaw what was coming, but did not flinch.
p2581
aVCHAPTER XIX.
p2582
aVTHE WICKED COMPACT.
p2583
aV"It appears to me, Mr. Rugg, that you have prospered," said the lady.
p2584
aV"That's where you're right, ma'am, and you couldn't be righter."
p2585
aV"I'm as poor as I can be."
p2586
aV"So am I," said the tramp, adding, with a cunning look, "but times will\u000abe better now."
p2587
aV"Why will they be better?"
p2588
aVasked Mrs. Middleton, suspiciously.
p2589
aV"Tony won't see me want when he comes into ten thousand a year."
p2590
aV"Who said he was coming into it?"
p2591
aVdemanded the lady, coldly.
p2592
aV"You said he was the heir."
p2593
aV"He hasn't got the estate, and I don't mean he shall have it."
p2594
aV"How will you prevent that ma'am?"
p2595
aVMrs. Middleton again put her hand on the man's tattered coat sleeve,\u000aand in a voice scarcely above a whisper, said:\u000a\u000a"Mr. Rugg, you must prevent it."
p2596
aV"How can I prevent it?"
p2597
aVasked the tramp, with an assumption of\u000ainnocence.
p2598
aV"I take it, you are not a religious man?"
p2599
aV"Not much," answered the tramp, with a short laugh.
p2600
aV"You are not afraid--to do wrong?"
p2601
aV"Yes, I am, ma'am; but if I was paid for it I might not mind."
p2602
aV"You shall be paid, and paid well."
p2603
aV"What do you want me to do?"
p2604
aVMrs. Middleton said, with slow significance:\u000a\u000a"This boy is in my way.
p2605
aVDon't you think he might manage to get sick and\u000adie?"
p2606
aV"Perhaps he might," said Rudolph, who did not appear to be shocked at\u000athe suggestion.
p2607
aV"Couldn't you manage it?"
p2608
aVshe asked, her eyes fixed upon the tramp.
p2609
aV"I might," he answered, shrewdly, "if it was going to do me any good."
p2610
aV"Then the only question is as to pay," she continued.
p2611
aV"That's about it ma'am.
p2612
aVIt's a big risk, you know.
p2613
aVI might get caught,\u000aand then money wouldn't do me much good."
p2614
aV"Nothing venture, nothing have.
p2615
aVYou don't want to be a pauper all your\u000alife?"
p2616
aV"No, I don't," answered the tramp with energy.
p2617
aV"I'm tired of tramping\u000around the country, sleeping in barns and under hay-stacks, and picking\u000aup meals where I can.
p2618
aVI've had enough of it."
p2619
aV"Do as I wish, and you need never suffer such privations again," said\u000athe tempter.
p2620
aV"How much will you give me?"
p2621
aVasked Rudolph, in a business-like manner.
p2622
aV"Five hundred dollars down and five hundred dollars income as long as\u000ayou live."
p2623
aVThis was good fortune of which Rudolph had never dreamed, but he\u000aunderstood how to make the best of the situation.
p2624
aV"It is not enough," he said, shaking his head.
p2625
aV"Not enough!"
p2626
aVexclaimed Mrs. Middleton, with a look of displeasure.
p2627
aV"Why, it seems to me very liberal.
p2628
aVYou can live comfortably all your\u000alife just for doing one thing."
p2629
aV"A thing which may bring me to the gallows.
p2630
aVIt's all very well to talk,\u000abut I can't risk my neck for that."
p2631
aVThe lady was not surprised.
p2632
aVShe had expected that she would be\u000acompelled to drive a bargain, and and she had named a sum less than she\u000awas willing to pay.
p2633
aV"You see," continued Rudolph, "it's going to be a great thing for\u000ayou.
p2634
aVYou'll be sure of a big estate and an income of two thousand\u000apounds--that's ten thousand dollars--a year, and it'll be me that gives\u000ait to you."
p2635
aV"You overestimate your services, Mr. Rugg," she said, coldly.
p2636
aV"If I\u000adecline to proceed further the estate will be mine."
p2637
aV"Not if I bring on the boy, and say he's the real heir."
p2638
aV"I shall deny it," said the lady, composedly, "and challenge you to the\u000aproof."
p2639
aV"You will?"
p2640
aVqueried the tramp, disconcerted.
p2641
aV"Of course I shall."
p2642
aV"Then I'll prove it," he continued, in tone of triumph.
p2643
aV"Who will believe you?"
p2644
aVasked Mrs. Middleton, quietly.
p2645
aV"Why shouldn't they?"
p2646
aV"You are a tramp, and a discreditable person.
p2647
aVYour appearance would be\u000aagainst you.
p2648
aVI suspect the boy is one of the same sort."
p2649
aV"No, he isn't.
p2650
aVI don't like him overmuch, but he's a handsome chap,\u000alooks the gentleman every inch, even if he is dressed a little shabby."
p2651
aV"I should charge you with conspiracy, Mr. Rugg.
p2652
aVYou'd find it uphill\u000awork fighting me without influence and without money.
p2653
aVTo begin with,\u000ahow would you get over to England?"
p2654
aVAs presented by Mrs. Middleton, certainly the chances did not look\u000aflattering.
p2655
aVBut an idea occurred to Rudolph, and he instantly expressed it:\u000a\u000a"Then, if there ain't no danger from me or the boy, why do you offer me\u000aanything to put him out of the way?"
p2656
aVMrs. Middleton hesitated.
p2657
aV"I may as well tell you," she said, after a moment's pause.
p2658
aV"I take it\u000afor granted you will keep the matter secret."
p2659
aV"Of course I will."
p2660
aV"Then it is this: I married Mr. Harvey Middleton to secure a home and a\u000aposition.
p2661
aVI didn't love him."
p2662
aV"Quite right, ma'am."
p2663
aV"I was a poor governess.
p2664
aVIt was a great thing for me to marry Mr.
p2665
aVMiddleton."
p2666
aV"I should think so."
p2667
aV"I made him a good wife.
p2668
aVHe had no reason to complain of me, and when\u000ahe died he left me in charge of the estate."
p2669
aV"For the boy?"
p2670
aV"Yes, for the boy, and this has given me trouble."
p2671
aV"He hasn't never troubled you."
p2672
aV"Not yet, and but for one thing I would not have come to America in\u000asearch of him."
p2673
aV"What is that?"
p2674
aV"That is the secret I am going to tell you.
p2675
aVI want to marry again."
p2676
aVThe tramp whistled.
p2677
aVMrs. Middleton frowned, but went on:\u000a\u000a"This time I love the man I want to marry.
p2678
aVHe is from an excellent\u000afamily, but he is a younger son, and has little or nothing himself.
p2679
aVIf\u000athe estate were mine absolutely, there would be no opposition on the\u000apart of his family to his marrying me to-morrow, but with the knowledge\u000athat the boy may turn up at any time, nothing will be done."
p2680
aV"I see," said the tramp, nodding.
p2681
aV"But for this, I never would have stirred in the matter at all.
p2682
aVI did\u000anot think it probable that the boy would ever hear of his inheritance."
p2683
aV"He don't even know who he is," said Rudolph.
p2684
aV"You never told him, then?"
p2685
aVsaid the lady in a tone of satisfaction.
p2686
aV"No.
p2687
aVWhat was the good?"
p2688
aV"There was no good, and you did wisely.
p2689
aVNow I have told you how matters\u000astand, and I renew the offer which I made you a few minutes since."
p2690
aV"It is too little," said the tramp, shaking his head.
p2691
aV"Tell me what you expect.
p2692
aVMind, I don't say that I will meet your views\u000aif they are extravagant.
p2693
aVStill I might agree to pay you a little more."
p2694
aV"I want just double what you offered me, ma'am."
p2695
aV"Why, that's extortion."
p2696
aV"That's as you choose to consider it, ma'am.
p2697
aVIt'll leave you money\u000aenough.
p2698
aVIt's one-tenth."
p2699
aV"Suppose I refuse."
p2700
aV"Then I'll go and see a lawyer, and he'll tell me what I had better do."
p2701
aV"Even if you succeeded, and got the boy in possession, do you think he\u000awould give you any more than I offered?"
p2702
aVThis was a consideration which had not occurred to the tramp.
p2703
aVHe had\u000aonly thought of punishing the lady for not acceding to his terms.
p2704
aVHe\u000aasked himself, moreover, did he really wish Tony to come into such a\u000apiece of good fortune, and that after the boy had been instrumental in\u000ahaving him arrested.
p2705
aVNo, anything but that!
p2706
aVHe decided to work for Mrs.\u000aMiddleton, and make the best terms he could.
p2707
aV"I'll tell you what I'll do ma'am," he said.
p2708
aV"I'll say eight hundred\u000adollars down, and the same every year."
p2709
aVTo this sum Mrs. Middleton finally agreed.
p2710
aV"You say you know where the boy is?"
p2711
aVshe asked.
p2712
aV"Yes, ma'am."
p2713
aV"Then there need be no delay."
p2714
aV"Only a little.
p2715
aVBut I shall want some money.
p2716
aVI haven't a penny."
p2717
aVMrs. Middleton took out her purse.
p2718
aV"Here are a hundred dollars," she said.
p2719
aV"The rest shall be paid you\u000awhen you have earned it."
p2720
aVRudolph rose to go, and as he went down stairs thoughtfully, he said to\u000ahimself:\u000a\u000a"That woman's a case if ever there was one.
p2721
aVHow coolly she hires me to\u000akill the boy.
p2722
aVI don't half like the job.
p2723
aVIt's too risky.
p2724
aVBut there's\u000amoney in it, and I can't refuse.
p2725
aVThe first thing is to find him!"
p2726
aVCHAPTER XX.
p2727
aVTHE FIGHTING QUAKER.
p2728
aVThe tramp decided that the best way to find Tony would be to return\u000ato that part of the country where he had lost him, and make inquiries\u000afor a boy of his description.
p2729
aVHe could do it more comfortably now,\u000abeing provided with funds, thanks to Mrs. Middleton.
p2730
aVHe was now able to\u000acommand fair accommodations, and this was satisfactory.
p2731
aVBut there was another difficulty which, at times, gave him uneasiness.
p2732
aVHe had escaped from the custody of the law, and was liable to be\u000aarrested.
p2733
aVThis would have disconcerted him, and interfered seriously\u000awith the purpose he had in view.
p2734
aV"I must disguise myself," thought Rudolph.
p2735
aV"It won't do to run any\u000arisk.
p2736
aVWhen I was a tramp I didn't care, but now I've got something to\u000alive for."
p2737
aVIt was not the first time in his varied experience that he had felt\u000athe need of a disguise, and he knew just where to go to find one.
p2738
aVIn\u000athe lower part of the city there was a shop well provided with such\u000aarticles as he required.
p2739
aVHe lost no time in seeking it out.
p2740
aV"What can I do for you, Mr.
p2741
aVRugg?"
p2742
aVasked the old man who kept the\u000aestablishment.
p2743
aV"I want a disguise."
p2744
aV"Then you've come to the right shop.
p2745
aVWhat will you be--a sailor, a\u000aQuaker, a--"\u000a\u000a"Hold, there," said Rudolph.
p2746
aV"You've named the very thing."
p2747
aV"What?"
p2748
aV"A Quaker.
p2749
aVCan you make me a good broad-brim?"
p2750
aV"Yea, verily," answered the old man, laughing, "I can suit thee to a T."\u000a\u000a"Do so, then."
p2751
aVFrom out a pile of costumes of various styles and fashions the old man\u000adrew a suit of drab and a broad-brimmed hat.
p2752
aV"How will that do?"
p2753
aVhe asked.
p2754
aV"Capital!"
p2755
aVanswered Rudolph, with satisfaction, "that is, if it will\u000afit."
p2756
aV"I'll answer for that.
p2757
aVIt's made for a man of your size.
p2758
aVWill you try\u000ait on?"
p2759
aV"First tell me the price."
p2760
aV"Thirty dollars."
p2761
aV"Thirty dollars!"
p2762
aVexclaimed the tramp, aghast.
p2763
aV"Do you think I am made\u000aof money?"
p2764
aV"Look at the quality, my good friend.
p2765
aVLook at the cloth."
p2766
aV"Why, I may not want the things for more than a week."
p2767
aV"Then, I'll tell you what I'll do.
p2768
aVIf you only use them a week, you\u000ashall bring them back, and I will pay you back twenty-five dollars;\u000athat is," added the old man cautiously, "if you don't hurt 'em too\u000amuch."
p2769
aV"That's better," said Rudolph.
p2770
aV"I'll try them on."
p2771
aVHe went into an inner room, provided for the purpose, and soon came out\u000aentirely transformed.
p2772
aVIn addition to the drab suit, a gray wig had been\u000asupplied, which gave him the appearance of a highly respectable old\u000aQuaker.
p2773
aVThe old man laughed heartily, for he had a merry vein.
p2774
aV"How dost thee like it?"
p2775
aVhe asked.
p2776
aV"Capital," said Rudolph; "would you know me?"
p2777
aV"I wouldn't dream it was you.
p2778
aVBut, Mr. Rugg, there's one thing you\u000amustn't forget."
p2779
aV"What's that?"
p2780
aV"To use the Quaker lingo.
p2781
aVJust now you said, 'Would you know me?'
p2782
aVThat\u000aisn't right."
p2783
aV"What should I say?"
p2784
aV"Would thee know me?"
p2785
aV"All right.
p2786
aVI'll get it after a while.
p2787
aVThere's your money."
p2788
aV"There you are again.
p2789
aVYou must say thy money."
p2790
aV"I see you know all about it.
p2791
aVYou've been a Quaker yourself, haven't\u000ayou?"
p2792
aV"Not I; but I was brought up in Philadelphia, and I have seen plenty of\u000athe old fellows.
p2793
aVThat's right.
p2794
aVNow, don't forget how to talk.
p2795
aVWhere are\u000ayou going?"
p2796
aV"Into the country on a little expedition," said Rudolph.
p2797
aV"When will you be back?"
p2798
aV"In a week, if all goes well."
p2799
aV"Well, good luck to you."
p2800
aV"I wish thee good luck, too," said the tramp.
p2801
aV"Ha, ha!
p2802
aVYou've got it; you'll do."
p2803
aVThe tramp emerged into the street, a very fair representative of a\u000asedate Quaker.
p2804
aVAt first he forgot his gray hair, and walked with\u000aa briskness that was hardly in character with his years.
p2805
aVHe soon\u000aattracted the attention of some street boys, who, not suspecting his\u000agenuineness, thought him fair game.
p2806
aV"How are you, old Broadbrim?"
p2807
aVsaid one.
p2808
aVRudolph didn't resent this.
p2809
aVHe felt rather pleased at this compliment\u000ato his get up.
p2810
aV"You'd make a good scarecrow, old buffer," said another.
p2811
aVStill the tramp kept his temper.
p2812
aVA third boy picked up a half-eaten apple and fired it at him.
p2813
aVThis was too much for the newly-converted disciple of William Penn.
p2814
aV"Just let me catch you, you little rascal," he exclaimed, "and I'll\u000agive you the worst licking you ever had."
p2815
aVThe boys stared open mouthed at such language from the sedate old\u000agentlemen.
p2816
aV"He's a fighting Quaker," said the first one, "keep out of his way."
p2817
aV"If thee don't, thee'll catch it," said Rudolph, fortunately\u000aremembering how he must talk.
p2818
aVHe had thought of pursuing the disturbers of his peace, but motives of\u000aprudence prevented him.

aVRUDOLPH HEARS OF TONY.
p2821
aVFour days afterward Rudolph arrived in the town where Tony was\u000aemployed.
p2822
aVHe had not been drawn thither by any clew, but by pure\u000aaccident.
p2823
aVHe put up for the night at the hotel where our hero had found work.
p2824
aVHe\u000aenrolled himself on the register as "Obadiah Latham, Philadelphia."
p2825
aVThis, he thought, would answer very well for a Quaker name, much\u000abetter, certainly, than Rudolph Rugg, which on other accounts also was\u000aobjectionable.
p2826
aV"Can thee give me a room, friend?"
p2827
aVhe inquired at the desk.
p2828
aV"Certainly, sir," was the polite reply.
p2829
aV"Here, Henry, show this old\u000agentleman up to No.
p2830
aV6.
p2831
aVNo.
p2832
aV6 is one of our best rooms, Mr.
p2833
aVLatham."
p2834
aV"I thank thee," said the tramp, who, by this time, was quite accustomed\u000ato the peculiar phraseology of the Friends.
p2835
aV"The Quakers are always polite," said the bookkeeper.
p2836
aV"They are good\u000apay, too, and never give any trouble.
p2837
aVI wish we had more of them stop\u000ahere."
p2838
aV"If all your customers were of that description, your bar wouldn't pay\u000avery well."
p2839
aV"That is true."
p2840
aVBut later in the evening the speaker was obliged to change his opinion.
p2841
aVThe Quaker came up to the bar, and asked:\u000a\u000a"Will thee give me a glass of brandy?"
p2842
aV"Sir?"
p2843
aVsaid the barkeeper, astounded, and hardly believing his ears.
p2844
aV"A glass of brandy!"
p2845
aVrepeated Rudolph, irritably.
p2846
aV"Where is thy ears?"
p2847
aV"I beg pardon, sir, but I was surprised.
p2848
aVI did not know that gentlemen\u000aof your faith ever drank liquor."
p2849
aV"Thee is right," said the tramp, recollecting himself.
p2850
aV"It is only for\u000amy health.
p2851
aVThee may make it strong, so that I may feel better soon."
p2852
aVRudolph drained the glass, and then after a little hesitation, he said:\u000a\u000a"I feel better.
p2853
aVWill thee mix me another glass, and a little stronger?"
p2854
aVA stronger glass was given him, and he poured it down rapidly.
p2855
aVThe barkeeper looked at him shrewdly.
p2856
aV"Quaker as he is, he is evidently used to brandy," he said to himself.
p2857
aV"If he wasn't those two glasses would have upset him."
p2858
aVBut Rudolph did not appear to be upset, or, indeed, to be in the least\u000aaffected.
p2859
aVHe put his broad-brimmed hat more firmly on his head, and went outside.
p2860
aVHe determined to take a walk about the village.
p2861
aVThis was his usual\u000acustom on arriving in a new place.
p2862
aVOn such occasions he kept his eyes\u000aopen, and looked about, in the hope that he might somewhere see the\u000aobject of his search.
p2863
aVHe little suspected that Tony was at that very\u000amoment in the stable-yard in the rear of the hotel.
p2864
aVHe walked on for perhaps a quarter of a mile, and then leaned against a\u000afence to rest.
p2865
aVAs he stood here, two boys passed him slowly, conversing\u000aas they walked.
p2866
aV"I was surprised, Sam, at Tony Rugg's whipping you," said the first.
p2867
aV"He couldn't do it again," said Sam, sullenly.
p2868
aVRudolph's attention was at once drawn.
p2869
aVTony Rugg!
p2870
aVWhy, there could be but one Tony Rugg.
p2871
aVHe advanced toward the boys.
p2872
aV"Boys," he asked, "did thee mention the name of Tony Rugg?"
p2873
aV"Yes, sir."
p2874
aV"Does thee know such a boy?"
p2875
aV"Yes, sir.
p2876
aVHe is working at the hotel.
p2877
aVHe got my place away from me,"\u000asaid Sam.
p2878
aV"Do you know him?"
p2879
aV"I once knew such a boy.
p2880
aVBut no!
p2881
aVhis name was Charles."
p2882
aV"Perhaps he's a relation."
p2883
aV"Perhaps thee are right."
p2884
aVThis the tramp said cunningly, not wishing Tony to hear that he had\u000abeen inquiring after him.
p2885
aVCHAPTER XXII.
p2886
aVRUDOLPH FINDS TONY.
p2887
aVRudolph was very much elated at what he had heard.
p2888
aVHis object then was\u000aalready attained, and the boy was found.
p2889
aV"Well, good luck has come to me at last," he said to himself.
p2890
aV"The\u000ayoung scoundrel is found, and now I must consider how to get him into\u000amy hands once more."
p2891
aVThe Quaker, to designate him according to his present appearance, at\u000aonce made his way back to the hotel.
p2892
aVHe wanted to see Tony and verify\u000athe information he had obtained from the boys, though he saw no reason\u000ato doubt it.
p2893
aV"There can't be two Tony Ruggs in the world," he said to himself.
p2894
aV"I am\u000asure this is the boy."
p2895
aVOn reaching the hotel he sauntered out into the stable-yard in the rear\u000aof the house.
p2896
aVHis eyes lighted with pleasure, for he at once caught\u000asight of Tony, standing beside James, the hostler.
p2897
aV"There comes old Broadbrim," said James in a low voice.
p2898
aV"The barkeeper\u000atold me he took two stiff horns of brandy.
p2899
aVHe's a queer sort of Quaker\u000ain my opinion."
p2900
aVTony gave a curious glance at the disguised tramp, but entertained no\u000asuspicion of his not being what he represented.
p2901
aVThe white hair and\u000acostume made it difficult to doubt.
p2902
aV"I never saw a Quaker before," he said.
p2903
aV"Didn't you?"
p2904
aVMeantime Rudolph came nearer.
p2905
aVHis disguise had been so successful that\u000ahe felt perfectly safe from discovery.
p2906
aV"Does thee keep many horses?"
p2907
aVhe asked.
p2908
aV"Yes, sir; we have twelve."
p2909
aV"That is a large number.
p2910
aVYea, verily, it is," said the tramp.
p2911
aV"Well, it is, but we need them all.
p2912
aVThere's a good deal of carting to\u000ado for the hotel, besides Mr. Porter keeps a livery stable.
p2913
aVWas you\u000aever this way before?"
p2914
aVasked James, thinking he might as well ask a few\u000aquestions also.
p2915
aV"Nay, verily."
p2916
aV"Where might you be from?"
p2917
aV"From Philadelphia."
p2918
aV"I've heard there's a good many Quakers out that way."
p2919
aV"Yea, verily, my friend, thee is right."
p2920
aV"Are you going away to-morrow morning?"
p2921
aV"Nay, friend, I think I shall tarry a day or two.
p2922
aVIs that lad thy son?"
p2923
aV"Tony, he asks if you are my son," said James, laughing.
p2924
aV"No, his name\u000ais Tony Rugg, while mine is James Woodley."
p2925
aV"Anthony, was thee born in this town?"
p2926
aVasked the tramp, boldly defying\u000adetection.
p2927
aV"No, sir," answered Tony.
p2928
aV"I only came here a few weeks ago."
p2929
aV"Yea, verily," was the only comment Rudolph made.
p2930
aV"I'd like to choke the boy.
p2931
aVI can hardly keep my hands off him," he\u000asaid to himself.
p2932
aV"But I'd better be going.
p2933
aVHe is looking at me closely.
p2934
aVHe might suspect something."
p2935
aV"Good-night," he said, and the two responded civilly to the salutation.
p2936
aV"Well, Tony, what do you think of Broadbrim?"
p2937
aVasked James.
p2938
aV"I don't know, there's something in his voice that sounds familiar to\u000ame."
p2939
aV"Perhaps you may have met him somewhere before," suggested the hostler.
p2940
aV"No, I am sure I have not.
p2941
aVI never met any Quaker before."
p2942
aV"Well, there's strange likenesses sometimes.
p2943
aVDid I ever tell you my\u000aadventure out in Maine?"
p2944
aV"No, what was it?"
p2945
aV"I went down East to see a sister of mine that is married down near\u000aAugusta.
p2946
aVWhen, as I was goin' through Portland, a woman came up and\u000amade a great ado about my deserting her.
p2947
aVShe took me for her husband,\u000aand came near having me arrested for desertion.
p2948
aVYou see I and her\u000ahusband was as like as two peas, that's what some of her neighbors\u000asaid."
p2949
aV"How did you get off?"
p2950
aV"Luckily I had documents in my pocket showing who I was.
p2951
aVBesides, my\u000abrother-in-law happened to be in the city, and he identified me."
p2952
aVRudolph sat in the public room of the hotel for a time, and then\u000ahe went up to his room, partly to be out of the way of possible\u000arecognition, partly to think how he could manage to get Tony into\u000ahis clutches once more, without betraying himself, or exciting any\u000ainterference.
p2953
aVHe had a back room, the window of which looked out upon the\u000astable-yard.
p2954
aVHe seated himself at this window, and in this position\u000acould easily see and hear all that passed there.
p2955
aVTony and the hostler were lounging about, the latter smoking a clay\u000apipe, their work being done for the day.
p2956
aV"Tony," said the hostler, "I almost forgot to tell you, you're to go to\u000aThornton to-morrow."
p2957
aV"What for?"
p2958
aV"There's a top-buggy Mr. Porter has sold to a man there.
p2959
aVYou're to take\u000ait over, and lead the horse back."
p2960
aV"How far is it?"
p2961
aV"About five miles."
p2962
aV"All right.
p2963
aVI'd just as leave go as stay here.
p2964
aVCan I find the road\u000aeasily?"
p2965
aV"There's no trouble about that.
p2966
aVIt's straight all the way.
p2967
aVPart of it\u000aruns through the woods--about a mile, I should say."
p2968
aV"Did Mr. Porter say when he wanted me to start?"
p2969
aV"About nine o'clock; by that time you'll be through your chores."
p2970
aV"Well, I'm willing."
p2971
aVRudolph heard this conversation with no little pleasure.
p2972
aV"It's the very chance I was waiting for," he said to himself.
p2973
aV"I'll lie\u000ain wait for him as he comes back.
p2974
aVI can easily hide in the woods."
p2975
aVCHAPTER XXIII.
p2976
aVTHE NEGLECTED WELL.
p2977
aVRudolph took care to breakfast in good season the next morning.
p2978
aVHe felt\u000athat this day was to make his fortune.
p2979
aVThe deed which would entitle him\u000ato a life support was to be perpetrated on that day.
p2980
aVHe shuddered a\u000alittle when he reflected that in order to compass this a life must be\u000asacrificed, and that the life of the boy who had been for years under\u000ahis guardianship, who had slept at his side, and borne with him the\u000aperils and privations of his adventurous career.
p2981
aVHe was a reckless man,\u000abut he had never before shed blood, or at any rate taken the life of a\u000ahuman being.
p2982
aVHe would have been less than human if the near approach of\u000asuch a crime had not made him nervous and uncomfortable.
p2983
aVBut against this feeling he fought strenuously.
p2984
aV"What's the odds?"
p2985
aVhe said to himself.
p2986
aV"The boy's got to die some time\u000aor other, and his dying now will make me comfortable for life.
p2987
aVNo\u000amore hungry tramps for me.
p2988
aVI'll settle down and be respectable.
p2989
aVEight\u000ahundred dollars a year will relieve me from all care, and I shall only\u000aneed to enjoy myself after this."
p2990
aVRudolph must have had strange notions of respectability to think it\u000acould be obtained by crime; but in fact his idea was that a man who\u000acould live on his own means was from that very power respectable, and\u000athere are plenty of persons of a higher social grade who share in this\u000adelusion.
p2991
aVAt a few minutes after nine Tony set out on his journey.
p2992
aVIt never\u000aoccurred to him that the old Quaker in suit of sober drab, who sat on\u000athe piazza and saw him depart, was a man who cherished sinister designs\u000aupon him.
p2993
aVIn fact, he had forgotten all about him, and was intent upon\u000ahis journey alone.
p2994
aVMost boys like to drive, and our friend Tony was no\u000aexception to this general rule.
p2995
aVHe thought it much better than working\u000aabout the stable-yard.
p2996
aV"Take care of yourself, Tony," said James, the hostler, in a friendly\u000atone.
p2997
aV"Oh, yes, I'll do that," said Tony, little dreaming how necessary the\u000aadmonition was likely to prove.
p2998
aV"I may as well be starting too," thought Rudolph, and some ten minutes\u000aafterward he started at a walk along the road which led to Thornton.
p2999
aV"I'll keep on as far as the woods," he thought, "and then I'll form\u000amy plans.
p3000
aVThe boy must not escape me, for I may never have as good a\u000achance to dispose of him again."
p3001
aVAbout two miles on began the woods to which reference has already been\u000amade.
p3002
aVThe tramp selected this as probably the best part of the road to\u000aaccomplish his criminal design.
p3003
aVThey extended for nearly a mile on either side of the road, and this\u000awas likely to facilitate his purpose.
p3004
aV"I'll explore a little," thought Rudolph.
p3005
aV"I shall have plenty of time\u000abefore the boy comes back."
p3006
aVSome forty rods from the road on the right hand side, the tramp\u000adiscovered a ruined hut, which had once belonged to a recluse who had\u000afor years lived apart from his kind.
p3007
aVThis had now fallen into decay,\u000afor the former occupant had been for some time dead, and no one had\u000abeen tempted to succeed him.
p3008
aVThe general appearance of the building satisfied Rudolph that it was\u000adeserted.
p3009
aVImpelled partly by curiosity, he explored the neighborhood of\u000athe house.
p3010
aVA rod to the east there was a well, open to the view, the curb having\u000adecayed, and being in a ruined condition, Rudolph looked down into it,\u000aand judged that it might be about twenty feet deep.
p3011
aVA diabolical suggestion came to him.
p3012
aVIf he could only lure Tony to this\u000awell and dispose of him forever.
p3013
aV"I'll do it," he muttered to himself, and started to return to the\u000aroad, where he hoped to intercept our hero.
p3014
aVPoor Tony!
p3015
aVhe little dreamed of the danger that menaced him.
p3016
aVCHAPTER XXIV.
p3017
aVTHE DEED IS DONE.
p3018
aVTony drove rapidly to Thornton and sought the purchaser of the buggy.
p3019
aVThere was a delay of half an hour in finding him, but at last his\u000abusiness was done, and he set out for home.
p3020
aVIt was not quite so amusing leading the horse as sitting in a buggy and\u000adriving him.
p3021
aVBut all our pleasures have to be paid for, and Tony was\u000aready to pay the price of this one.
p3022
aVAfter all, he reflected, it was\u000aquite as amusing as working about the stable yard, especially after it\u000aoccurred to him to mount the animal and thus spare himself fatigue.
p3023
aVEverything went smoothly till he entered the woody part of the road.
p3024
aV"Now I shall be home soon," he said to himself.
p3025
aV"But, hallo!
p3026
aVwho's\u000athat?"
p3027
aVas a figure stepped out from the side of the road.
p3028
aV"Oh, it's the\u000aQuaker.
p3029
aVI wonder what brought him here?"
p3030
aV"Friend, is thee in a hurry?"
p3031
aVasked the impostor.
p3032
aV"I suppose I ought to get back as soon as I can," said Tony.
p3033
aV"Why,\u000awhat's up?"
p3034
aV"Thee is the boy from the hotel, is thee not?"
p3035
aVasked Rudolph.
p3036
aV"Yes.
p3037
aVYou're the Quaker gentleman that is stopping there?"
p3038
aV"Yes."
p3039
aV"Well, what do you want of me?"
p3040
aV"There's a man in the woods that has fallen down a well, and I fear he\u000ais badly hurt."
p3041
aV"A man fallen down a well!"
p3042
aVexclaimed Tony.
p3043
aV"Yes."
p3044
aV"Where is the well?"
p3045
aV"Back in the woods."
p3046
aV"How did you find him?"
p3047
aV"I was walking for amusement when I heard groans, and looking down I\u000acould see the poor man."
p3048
aVTony never thought of doubting this statement, and said, in a tone of\u000agenuine sympathy: "Poor fellow!"
p3049
aV"Will thee go with me and help get him out?"
p3050
aVasked the Quaker.
p3051
aV"Yes," said Tony, readily, "I'll do it.
p3052
aVNever mind if I am a little\u000alate.
p3053
aVWhere shall I put the horse?"
p3054
aV"Lead him into the woods and tie him to a tree."
p3055
aV"All right.
p3056
aVI guess that'll be the best way."
p3057
aVThe horse was disposed of as had been suggested, and the two set forth\u000aon what Tony supposed to be their charitable errand.
p3058
aV"I don't see what made you go into the woods?"
p3059
aVsaid our hero, a little\u000apuzzled.
p3060
aV"I was brought up in the woods, my young friend.
p3061
aVIt reminds me of the\u000atime when I was a boy like thee."
p3062
aV"Oh, that's it.
p3063
aVWell, it was lucky for the man, that is if we can get\u000ahim out.
p3064
aVDid you speak to him?"
p3065
aV"Yes, verily."
p3066
aV"And did he answer?"
p3067
aV"He groaned.
p3068
aVI think he was insensible.
p3069
aVI saw that I should need help,\u000aand I came to the road again.
p3070
aVLuckily thee came by."
p3071
aV"Had you been waiting long?"
p3072
aV"Only five minutes," answered Rudolph.
p3073
aVIn reality he had been compelled to wait near an hour, much to his\u000adisgust.
p3074
aVIn fact, he had been led to fear that there might be some\u000aother road by which one could return from Thornton, and that Tony had\u000ataken it.
p3075
aVShould this be the case, his elaborate trap would be useless.
p3076
aVThey had come quite near the ruined dwelling, and already the curb of\u000athe well was visible.
p3077
aV"Is that the well?"
p3078
aVasked Tony.
p3079
aV"Yes," answered the Quaker.
p3080
aV"Let us hurry, then," said Tony.
p3081
aVBut the time had come when Tony was to have revealed to him the real\u000acharacter of his companion.
p3082
aVA branch, which hung unusually low, knocked\u000aoff the hat and wig of the pseudo Quaker, and Tony was petrified with\u000adismay when he saw revealed the black, cropped head and sinister face\u000aof Rudolph, the tramp.
p3083
aV"Rudolph!"
p3084
aVhe exclaimed, stopping short in his amazement.
p3085
aV"Yes," said the tramp, avowing himself, now that he saw disguise was\u000auseless; "it's Rudolph.
p3086
aVAt last I have you, you young scamp!"
p3087
aVand he\u000aseized the boy's arm as in the grip of a vise.
p3088
aVTony tried to shake off the grip, but what could a boy do against an\u000aathletic man.
p3089
aV"It's no use," said the tramp, between his teeth, "I've got you, and I\u000adon't mean to let you go."
p3090
aV"What do you mean to do, Rudolph?"
p3091
aVasked Tony, uneasily.
p3092
aV"What do I mean to do?
p3093
aVI mean to make you repent of what you've done to\u000ame, you young whelp."
p3094
aV"What have I done?"
p3095
aV"What haven't you done?
p3096
aVYou've betrayed me, and sold me to my enemies.
p3097
aVThat's what you've done."
p3098
aV"I've only done what I was obliged to do.
p3099
aVI don't want to do you any\u000amore harm.
p3100
aVLet me go, and I won't meddle with you any more, nor say a\u000aword about you at the hotel."
p3101
aV"Really," said Rudolph, with a disagreeable sneer, "I feel very much\u000aobliged to you.
p3102
aVYou are very kind, upon my soul.
p3103
aVSo you won't tell them\u000aat the hotel that the Quaker gentleman is only a tramp after all."
p3104
aV"No, I will say nothing about you."
p3105
aV"I don't think you are to be trusted, boy."
p3106
aV"Did you ever know me to tell a lie, Rudolph?"
p3107
aVasked Tony, proudly.
p3108
aV"I\u000adon't pretend to be a model boy, but there's one thing I won't do, and\u000athat is lie."
p3109
aV"I think I had better make sure that you don't say anything about me,"\u000asaid the tramp, significantly.
p3110
aV"How?"
p3111
aVasked Tony.
p3112
aV"I don't mean to let you go back to the hotel at all."
p3113
aV"But I must go back.
p3114
aVI must drive the horse back."
p3115
aV"That's of no importance."
p3116
aV"Yes, it is," persisted Tony, anxiously.
p3117
aV"They will think I have stolen\u000ait."
p3118
aV"Let them think so."
p3119
aV"But I don't want them to think me a thief."
p3120
aV"I can't help it."
p3121
aV"What are you going to do with me?
p3122
aVWhere are we going?"
p3123
aV"Before I tell you that I will tell you something more.
p3124
aVYou have often\u000aasked me who you were."
p3125
aV"You always told me I was your son."
p3126
aV"It was not true," said Rudolph, calmly.
p3127
aV"You are not related to me."
p3128
aV"I felt sure of it."
p3129
aV"Oh, you did!"
p3130
aVsneered the tramp.
p3131
aV"You are glad that you are not my\u000ason!"
p3132
aV"Who am I?"
p3133
aV"I will tell you this much, that you are the heir to a fortune."
p3134
aV"I the heir to a fortune!"
p3135
aVexclaimed Tony, in natural excitement.
p3136
aV"Yes; and I could help you to secure it if I pleased."
p3137
aVTony knew not what to say or to think.
p3138
aVWas it possible that he--Tony,\u000athe tramp--was a gentleman's son, and heir to a fortune?
p3139
aVIt was almost\u000aincredible.
p3140
aVMoreover, what was the object of Rudolph in imparting this\u000asecret, and at this time, when he sought revenge upon him.
p3141
aV"Is this true?"
p3142
aVhe asked.
p3143
aV"Perfectly true."
p3144
aV"And you know my real name and family?"
p3145
aV"Yes, I do."
p3146
aV"Oh, Rudolph, tell me who I am," Tony said, imploringly.
p3147
aV"Help me to\u000athe fortune which you say I am entitled to, and I will take care that\u000ayou are rewarded."
p3148
aVRudolph surveyed the boy, whom he still held in his firm grasp, and\u000awatched his excitement with malicious satisfaction.
p3149
aV"There is one objection to my doing that, boy," he said.
p3150
aV"What is that?"
p3151
aV"I'll tell you," he hissed, as his grasp grew tighter, and his dark\u000aface grew darker yet with passion, "_I hate you!_"\u000a\u000aThis he uttered with such intensity that Tony, brave as he was, was\u000astartled and dismayed.
p3152
aV"Then why did you tell me?"
p3153
aVhe asked.
p3154
aV"That you might know what you are going to lose--that you might repent\u000abetraying me," answered Rudolph, rapidly.
p3155
aV"You ask me what I am going\u000ato do with you?
p3156
aVI am going to throw you down that well, and leave you\u000athere--to die!"
p3157
aVThen commenced a struggle between the man and boy.
p3158
aVTony knew what he\u000ahad to expect, and he fought for dear life.
p3159
aVRudolph found that he had\u000aundertaken no light task, but he, too, was desperate.
p3160
aVHe succeeded at\u000alast in dragging Tony to the well-curb, and, raising him in his sinewy\u000aarms, he let him fall.
p3161
aVThen, without waiting to look down, he hurried out of the wood with all\u000aspeed.
p3162
aVHe reached the hotel, settled his bill, and paid to have himself\u000acarried over to the nearest railroad station.
p3163
aVNot until he was fairly seated in the cars, and was rushing through\u000athe country at the rate of thirty miles an hour, did he pause to\u000acongratulate himself.
p3164
aV"Now for an easy life!"
p3165
aVhe ejaculated.
p3166
aV"My fortune is made!
p3167
aVI shall\u000anever have to work any more."
p3168
aVCHAPTER XXV.
p3169
aV"I HOLD YOU TO THE BOND."
p3170
aVOn reaching New York, Rudolph made his way at once to the shop from\u000awhich he had obtained his Quaker dress.
p3171
aV"Has thee come back?"
p3172
aVasked the old man, in a jocular tone.
p3173
aV"Yea, verily," answered Rudolph.
p3174
aV"How do you like being a Quaker?"
p3175
aV"I've had enough of it.
p3176
aVI want you to take them back.
p3177
aVYou promised to\u000areturn me twenty-five dollars."
p3178
aV"Let me look at them," said the old man, cautiously.
p3179
aV"They've seen hard usage," he said.
p3180
aV"Look at that rip, and that spot."
p3181
aV"Humbug!"
p3182
aVanswered Rudolph.
p3183
aV"There's nothing but what you can set\u000astraight in half an hour, and five dollars is handsome pay for that."
p3184
aVBut the old man stood out for seven, and finally the tramp, though\u000agrumbling much, was obliged to come to his terms.
p3185
aV"Where have you been?"
p3186
aVasked the old man, whose curiosity was aroused\u000aas to what prompted Rudolph to obtain the disguise.
p3187
aV"That's my business," said Rudolph, who had his reasons for secrecy, as\u000awe know.
p3188
aV"I meant no offense--I only wondered if you left the city."
p3189
aV"Yes, I've been into New Jersey," answered the tramp, who thought it\u000apolitic to put the customer on the wrong scent.
p3190
aV"You see I've got an\u000aold uncle--a Quaker--living there.
p3191
aVThe old man's got plenty of money,\u000aand I thought if I could only make him think me a good Quaker, I should\u000astand a good chance of being remembered in his will."
p3192
aV"I see--a capital idea.
p3193
aVDid it work?"
p3194
aV"I can't tell yet.
p3195
aVHe gave me four dollars and his blessing for the\u000apresent," said Rudolph, carelessly.
p3196
aV"That's a lie every word of it," said the old man to himself, after\u000athe tramp went out.
p3197
aV"You must try to fix up a more probable story next\u000atime, Mr. Rudolph.
p3198
aVHe's been up to some mischief, probably.
p3199
aVHowever,\u000ait's none of my business, I've made seven dollars out of him, and that\u000apays me well--yes, it pays me well."
p3200
aVWhen Rudolph left the costumer's, it occurred to him that the tramp's\u000adress which he had resumed had better be changed, partly because he\u000athought it probable that a journey lay before him.
p3201
aVHe sought out a\u000alarge ready-made clothing establishment on Fulton street, and with the\u000amoney which had been returned to him obtained a respectable-looking\u000asuit, which quite improved his appearance.
p3202
aVHe regarded his reflection\u000ain a long mirror with considerable satisfaction.
p3203
aVHe felt that he would\u000anow be taken for a respectable citizen, and that in discarding his old\u000adress he had removed all vestiges of the tramp.
p3204
aVIn this, however, he\u000awas not wholly right.
p3205
aVHis face and general expression he could not\u000achange.
p3206
aVA careful observer could read in them something of the life he\u000ahad lead.
p3207
aVStill he was changed for the better, and it pleased him.
p3208
aV"Now," he reflected, "I had better go and see Mrs. Harvey Middleton.
p3209
aVI\u000ahave done the work, and I shall claim the reward."
p3210
aVHe hurried to the St. Nicholas, and, experienced now in the ways of\u000aobtaining access to a guest, he wrote his name on a card and sent it up.
p3211
aV"The lady will see you," was the answer brought back by the servant.
p3212
aV"Of course she will," thought Rudolph.
p3213
aV"She'll want to know whether\u000ait's all settled, and she has no further cause for fear."
p3214
aVMrs. Middleton looked up as he entered.
p3215
aV"Sit down, Mr. Rugg," she said, politely.
p3216
aVHer manner was cool and composed; but when the servant had left the\u000aroom, she rose from her chair, and in a tone which showed the anxiety\u000awhich she had till then repressed, she asked, abruptly: "Well, Mr.\u000aRugg, have you any news for me?"
p3217
aV"Yes, ma'am, I have," he answered, deliberately.
p3218
aV"What is it?
p3219
aVDon't keep me in suspense," she said, impatiently.
p3220
aV"The job's done," said Rudolph briefly.
p3221
aV"You mean that the boy--"\u000a\u000a"Accidentally fell down a well, and was killed," said the visitor,\u000afinishing the sentence.
p3222
aV"Horrible!"
p3223
aVmurmured the lady.
p3224
aV"Wasn't it?"
p3225
aVsaid Rudolph, with a grin.
p3226
aV"He must have been very\u000acareless."
p3227
aVMrs. Middleton did not immediately speak.
p3228
aVThough she was responsible\u000afor this crime, having instigated it, she was really shocked when it\u000awas brought home to her.
p3229
aV"You are sure he is dead?"
p3230
aVshe said, after a pause.
p3231
aV"When a chap pitches head-first down a well thirty feet deep, there\u000aisn't much hope for him, is there?"
p3232
aV"No, I suppose not.
p3233
aVWhere did this accident happen?"
p3234
aVasked the lady.
p3235
aV"That ain't important," answered Rudolph.
p3236
aV"It's happened--that's all\u000ayou need to know.
p3237
aVTony won't never come after that estate of his."
p3238
aV"It would have done him little good.
p3239
aVHe was not fitted by education to\u000aassume it."
p3240
aV"No; but he might have been educated.
p3241
aVBut that's all over now.
p3242
aVIt's\u000ayours.
p3243
aVNobody can take it from you."
p3244
aV"True!"
p3245
aVsaid Mrs. Middleton, and a look of pleasure succeeded the\u000amomentary horror.
p3246
aV"You will be ready to testify that the boy is dead?"
p3247
aV"There won't be any danger, will there?
p3248
aVThey won't ask too many\u000aquestions?"
p3249
aV"As to that, I think we had better decide what we will say.
p3250
aVIt won't be\u000anecessary to say how the boy died."
p3251
aV"Won't it?"
p3252
aV"No.
p3253
aVIndeed, it will be better to give a different account."
p3254
aV"Will that do just as well?"
p3255
aV"Yes.
p3256
aVYou can say, for instance, that he died of small-pox while under\u000ayour care in St. Louis, or any other place."
p3257
aV"And that I tended him to the last with the affection of a father,"\u000aadded Rudolph, grinning.
p3258
aV"To be sure.
p3259
aVYou must settle upon all the details of the story, so as\u000anot to be caught in any discrepancies."
p3260
aV"What's that?"
p3261
aVasked the tramp, rather mystified.
p3262
aV"Your story must hang together.
p3263
aVIt mustn't contradict itself."
p3264
aV"To be sure.
p3265
aVHow long are you going to stay in New York?"
p3266
aV"There is no further occasion for my staying here.
p3267
aVI shall sail to\u000aEngland in a week."
p3268
aV"Will it be all right about the money?"
p3269
aVasked Rudolph, anxiously.
p3270
aV"Certainly."
p3271
aV"How am I to be sure of that?"
p3272
aV"The word of a lady, sir," said Mrs. Middleton, haughtily, "ought to be\u000asufficient for you."
p3273
aV"That's all very well, but suppose you should get tired of paying me\u000athe money?"
p3274
aV"Then you could make it very disagreeable for me by telling all you\u000aknow about the boy.
p3275
aVHowever, there will be no occasion for that.
p3276
aVI\u000ashall keep my promise.
p3277
aVWill you be willing to sail for England next\u000aweek."
p3278
aV"Do you mean that I am to go with you?"
p3279
aV"I mean that you are to go.
p3280
aVYour testimony must be given on the other\u000aside, in order to make clear my title to the estate."
p3281
aV"I see, ma'am.
p3282
aVIf I'd known that I wouldn't have had no fears about the\u000amoney."
p3283
aV"You need have none, Mr. Rugg," said Mrs. Middleton, coldly.
p3284
aV"The fact\u000ais, we are necessary to each other.
p3285
aVEach can promote the interests of\u000athe other."
p3286
aV"That's so, ma'am.
p3287
aVLet's shake hands on that," said Rudolph, advancing\u000awith outstretched hand.
p3288
aV"No, thank you," said Mrs. Middleton, coldly.
p3289
aV"You forget yourself,\u000asir.
p3290
aVDo not forget that I am a lady, and that you are--"\u000a\u000a"We are equal, ma'am in this matter," said Rudolph, offended.
p3291
aV"You\u000aneedn't shrink from shaking hands with me."
p3292
aV"That is not in the agreement," said Mrs. Middleton, haughtily.
p3293
aV"I\u000ashall do what I have agreed, but except so far as it is necessary in\u000athe way of business, I wish you to keep yourself away from me.
p3294
aVWe\u000abelong to different grades in society."
p3295
aV"Why didn't you say that the other day, ma'am?"
p3296
aVsaid Rudolph, frowning.
p3297
aV"Because I didn't suppose it to be necessary.
p3298
aVYou did not offer to\u000ashake hands with me then.
p3299
aVBesides, at that time you had not--"\u000a\u000a"Pushed the boy down the well, if that's what you mean," said Rudolph,\u000abluntly.
p3300
aV"Hush!
p3301
aVdon't refer to that.
p3302
aVI advise you this for your own sake."
p3303
aV"And for the sake of somebody else."
p3304
aV"Mr. Rugg, all this discussion is idle.
p3305
aVIt can do no good.
p3306
aVFor whatever\u000aservice you have rendered, you shall be well paid.
p3307
aVThat you understand.
p3308
aVBut it is best that we should know as little of each other henceforth\u000aas possible.
p3309
aVIt might excite suspicion, as you can understand."
p3310
aV"Perhaps you are right, ma'am," said Rudolph, slowly.
p3311
aV"Call here day after to-morrow, and I will let you know by what\u000asteamer I take passage for England, that you may obtain a ticket.
p3312
aVGood\u000aafternoon."
p3313
aVRudolph left the lady's presence not wholly pleased.
p3314
aV"Why wouldn't she shake my hand?"
p3315
aVhe muttered to himself.
p3316
aV"She's as\u000adeep in it as I am."
p3317
aVCHAPTER XXVI.
p3318
aVTONY'S ESCAPE.
p3319
aVWe must now return to our young hero, who was certainly in a critical\u000aposition.
p3320
aVThough strong of his age, the reader will hardly be surprised\u000athat he should have been overpowered by a man like Rudolph.
p3321
aVWhen the false Quaker's hat and wig were taken off, though he was at\u000afirst surprised, he for the first time understood why the man's face\u000aand voice had seemed familiar to him from the time they first met.
p3322
aVHe struggled in vain against the fate in store for him.
p3323
aVHe felt that\u000awith him it was to be a matter of life and death, and taken by surprise\u000athough he was, he was on the alert to save his life if he could.
p3324
aVThe well curb was partially destroyed, as we have said, but the rope\u000astill hung from it.
p3325
aVAt the instant of his fall, Tony managed while in\u000atransit to grasp the rope by one hand.
p3326
aVHe swung violently from one side\u000ato the other, and slipped a few feet downward.
p3327
aVThis Rudolph did not\u000asee, for as soon as he had hurled the boy into the well he hurried away.
p3328
aVTony waited for the rope to become steady before attempting to ascend\u000ahand over hand.
p3329
aVUnfortunately for his purpose the rope was rotten, and\u000abroke just above where he grasped it, precipitating him to the bottom\u000aof the well.
p3330
aVBut he was already so far from the opening that his fall\u000awas not over ten feet.
p3331
aVLuckily also the water was not over two feet\u000ain depth.
p3332
aVTherefore, though he was jarred and startled by the sudden\u000adescent, he was not injured.
p3333
aV"Well," thought Tony, "I'm as low as I can get--that's one comfort.
p3334
aVNow\u000ais there any chance of my getting out?"
p3335
aVHe looked up, and it gave him a peculiar sensation to look up at the\u000ablue sky from the place where he stood.
p3336
aVHe feared that Rudolph was\u000astill at hand and would resist any efforts he might make to get out of\u000athe well.
p3337
aV"If he don't interfere I'm bound to get out," he said to himself,\u000apluckily.
p3338
aVHis feet were wet, of course, and this was far from comfortable.
p3339
aVHe made a brief examination of the situation, and then decided upon his\u000aplan.
p3340
aVThe well, like most in the country, was provided by a wall of\u000astones, piled one upon another.
p3341
aVIn parts it looked rather loose, and\u000aTony shuddered as he thought of the possibility of the walls falling,\u000aand his being buried in the ruins.
p3342
aV"It would be all up with me, then," he thought, "I must get out of\u000athis as soon as I can.
p3343
aVIf I can only climb up as far as the rope I can\u000aescape."
p3344
aVThis, in fact, seemed to be his only chance.
p3345
aVUsing the wall as a\u000aladder, he began cautiously to ascend.
p3346
aVMore than once he came near\u000afalling a second time, but by greatest exertion he finally reached the\u000arope.
p3347
aVHe did not dare to trust to it entirely, but contrived to ascend\u000aas before, clinging to the rope with his hands.
p3348
aVHe was in constant fear\u000athat it would break a second time, but the strain upon it was not so\u000agreat, and finally, much to his delight, he reached the top.
p3349
aVHe breathed a deep sigh of relief when he found himself once more on\u000a_terra firma_.
p3350
aVHe looked about him cautiously, under the apprehension\u000athat Rudolph might be near by, and ready to attack him again.
p3351
aVBut, as\u000awe know, his fears were groundless.
p3352
aV"He made sure that I was disposed of," thought Tony.
p3353
aV"What could have\u000ainduced him to attempt my life?
p3354
aVCan it be true, as he said, that I am\u000aheir to a fortune?
p3355
aVWhy couldn't he tell me?
p3356
aVI would have paid him well\u000afor the information when I got my money.
p3357
aVThen he said he knew who I\u000awas--I care more for that than the money."
p3358
aVBut Tony could not dwell upon these thoughts.
p3359
aVThe claims of duty were\u000aparamount.
p3360
aVHe must seek the horse, and go back to the hotel.
p3361
aVHe had\u000abeen detained already for nearly three-quarters of an hour, and they\u000awould be wondering what had become of him.
p3362
aVHe made his way as quickly as possible to where he had tied the horse.
p3363
aVBut he looked for him in vain.
p3364
aVHe had been untied and led away--perhaps\u000astolen.
p3365
aVTony felt assured that the horse of himself could not leave the\u000aspot.
p3366
aV"It must be Rudolph," he said to himself.
p3367
aV"He has made off with the\u000ahorse.
p3368
aVNow I am in trouble.
p3369
aVWhat will Mr. Porter say to me?"
p3370
aVTony was in error, as we know, in concluding that Rudolph had carried\u000aaway the horse.
p3371
aVThe tramp had no use for him.
p3372
aVBesides, he knew that\u000asuch a proceeding would have exposed him to suspicion, which it was\u000avery important for him to avoid.
p3373
aVWho, then, had taken the horse?
p3374
aVThat is a question which we are able to\u000aanswer, though Tony could not.
p3375
aVFifteen minutes before Sam Payson, whose place Tom had taken, with a\u000acompanion, Ben Hardy, while wandering through the woods had espied a\u000ahorse.
p3376
aV"Hallo!"
p3377
aVsaid Ben, "here's a horse."
p3378
aV"So it is," said Sam.
p3379
aV"It's rather odd that he should be tied here."
p3380
aV"I wonder whose it is?"
p3381
aVSam had been examining him carefully, and had recognized him.
p3382
aV"It's Mr. Porter's Bill.
p3383
aVDon't you see that white spot?
p3384
aVThat's the way\u000aI know him.
p3385
aVI have harnessed that horse fifty times."
p3386
aV"But how did he come here?
p3387
aVThat's the question?"
p3388
aV"I'll tell you," said Sam.
p3389
aV"I was at the hotel this morning, and heard\u000athat that boy Tony was to go over to Thornton with him."
p3390
aV"That don't explain why he is tied here, does it?"
p3391
aV"Tony must have tied him while he was taking a tramp in the woods.
p3392
aVWouldn't Porter be mad if he knew it?"
p3393
aV"I shouldn't wonder if Tony would get bounced."
p3394
aV"Nor I. I tell you what, Ben, I've a great mind to untie the horse, and\u000atake him back myself."
p3395
aV"What's the good?
p3396
aVIt would be an awful job.
p3397
aVWe came out here to have\u000asome fun," grumbled Ben.
p3398
aV"This would be fun to me.
p3399
aVI'll get Tony into trouble, and very likely\u000aget back the place he cheated me out of.
p3400
aVI guess it'll pay."
p3401
aV"All right, Sam.
p3402
aVI didn't think of that.
p3403
aVI'd like to see how Tony looks\u000awhen he comes back, and finds the horse gone."
p3404
aV"It'll serve him right," said Sam.
p3405
aV"What business had he to interfere\u000awith me, I'd like to know."
p3406
aV"If you're going to do it you'd better hurry up.
p3407
aVHe may go back any\u000atime."
p3408
aV"That's so.
p3409
aVHere goes, then."
p3410
aVIn a trice Bill was untied, and Sam taking the halter led him away.
p3411
aVWhen Tony came up he was not in sight.
p3412
aVThough Tony felt convinced that Rudolph had carried away the horse, he\u000afelt it to be his duty to look about for it.
p3413
aVThere was a bare chance\u000athat he might find it somewhere in the wood.
p3414
aVIn this way he lost\u000aconsiderable time.
p3415
aVHad he started for the hotel immediately he would\u000avery likely have overtaken the two boys.
p3416
aVSam kept on his way, and finally arrived at the hotel.
p3417
aVAs he led the horse into the stable-yard James, the hostler, exclaimed\u000ain surprise:\u000a\u000a"How came you by that horse, Sam Payson?"
p3418
aV"Is that the way you thank me for bringing him back?"
p3419
aVasked Sam.
p3420
aV"He left the stable under the charge of Tony Rugg this morning."
p3421
aV"Pretty care he takes of him, then."
p3422
aV"What do you mean?
p3423
aVWhere did you find him?"
p3424
aV"Down in the woods?"
p3425
aV"What woods?"
p3426
aV"Between here and Thornton."
p3427
aV"Wasn't Tony with him?"
p3428
aV"No."
p3429
aV"Are you sure of that?
p3430
aVAre you sure you two boys didn't attack Tony and\u000atake the horse away?"
p3431
aVdemanded James, suspiciously.
p3432
aV"No, we didn't.
p3433
aVIf you don't believe me, you may ask Ben."
p3434
aV"How was it, Ben?"
p3435
aVhe asked.
p3436
aV"Just as Sam has said.
p3437
aVWe found the horse alone in the woods.
p3438
aVWe\u000athought he might be stolen, and we brought him home.
p3439
aVIt was a good deal\u000aof trouble, for it's full two miles."
p3440
aVJames looked from one to the other in perplexity.
p3441
aV"I don't understand it at all," he said.
p3442
aV"It don't look like Tony to\u000aneglect his duty that way."
p3443
aV"You've got too high an opinion of that boy entirely," said Sam,\u000asneeringly.
p3444
aV[Illustration: Tony sprung forward and seized the would-be murderer by\u000athe arm.

p3446
aVCHAPTER XXVII.
p3447
aVTONY IS DISCHARGED.
p3448
aVPresently Tony came into the yard.
p3449
aVHe was looking very sober.
p3450
aVHe had\u000alost the horse, and he didn't know how to excuse himself.
p3451
aVHe didn't\u000afeel that he had been to blame, but he suspected that he should be\u000ablamed nevertheless.
p3452
aV"What did you do with the horse, Tony?"
p3453
aVasked James.
p3454
aV"He was stolen from me," answered Tony.
p3455
aV"How could that be?"
p3456
aV"I expect it was the Quaker."
p3457
aV"The Quaker!"
p3458
aVrepeated James, in amazement.
p3459
aV"Are you sure you're not\u000acrazy--or drunk?"
p3460
aV"Neither one," said Tony.
p3461
aV"It's a long story and----"\u000a\u000a"You must tell it to Mr. Porter then.
p3462
aVHe wants to see you right off.
p3463
aVBut I'll tell you for your information that the horse is here."
p3464
aV"Is here?
p3465
aVWho brought it?"
p3466
aV"Sam Payson brought it a short time since."
p3467
aV"Sam Payson!
p3468
aVWhere did he say he found it?"
p3469
aV"In the woods."
p3470
aV"Then he might have left it there," said Tony, indignantly.
p3471
aV"What\u000abusiness had he to untie it, and give me all this trouble?"
p3472
aV"You can speak to Mr. Porter about that."
p3473
aV"Where is he?"
p3474
aV"In the office."
p3475
aVTony entered the office.
p3476
aVMr. Porter regarded him with a frown.
p3477
aV"How is this, Tony?"
p3478
aVhe began.
p3479
aV"You leave my horse in the woods to be\u000abrought home by another boy.
p3480
aVHe might have been stolen, do you know\u000athat?"
p3481
aV"I've been deceived, and led into a trap," said Tony.
p3482
aV"What on earth do you mean?
p3483
aVWho has deceived and trapped you?"
p3484
aV"The Quaker who was stopping here.
p3485
aVHas he come back?"
p3486
aV"He has settled his bill and left the hotel.
p3487
aVWhat cock-and-bull story\u000ais this you have hatched up?"
p3488
aV"It is a true story, Mr. Porter.
p3489
aVThis man was not a Quaker at all.
p3490
aVHe\u000awas a tramp."
p3491
aV"Take care what you say, Tony.
p3492
aVDo you take me for a fool?"
p3493
aV"He is a man I used to know.
p3494
aVWhen I was coming home he was waiting for\u000ame in the woods, only I didn't know who he really was.
p3495
aVHe told me there\u000awas a man who had fallen into a well in the woods, and he wanted my\u000ahelp to get him out.
p3496
aVSo I tied the horse and went with him.
p3497
aVI wouldn't\u000ahave left him but for the story of the man in the well."
p3498
aV"Go on," said the landlord.
p3499
aV"I warn you I don't believe a word of this\u000awonderful story of yours."
p3500
aV"I can't help it," said Tony, desperately.
p3501
aV"It's true."
p3502
aV"Go on, and I'll give you my opinion of it afterward."
p3503
aV"Just before we got to the well a branch took off his hat and wig, and\u000aI saw that he was no Quaker, but my enemy, Rudolph Rugg."
p3504
aV"Rudolph Rugg!
p3505
aVA very good name for a romance."
p3506
aVTony proceeded:\u000a\u000a"Then I tried to get away, but it was too late.
p3507
aVThe man seized me and\u000athrew me down the well.
p3508
aVBut first he told me that he knew who I was,\u000aand that I was heir to a large fortune."
p3509
aV"Indeed!
p3510
aVHow happens it that you are not at the bottom of the well\u000astill?"
p3511
aV"I got out."
p3512
aV"So I see; but how?"
p3513
aV"I climbed up by the stones till I reached the rope, and then I found\u000ait easy.
p3514
aVI hurried to where I had left the horse, but it was gone.
p3515
aVI\u000asupposed that the Quaker had taken it, but James tells me Sam Payson\u000afound it and brought it back."
p3516
aV"Look here, boy," said the landlord, sternly, "do you expect me to\u000abelieve this romance of yours?"
p3517
aV"I don't know whether you will or not, sir.
p3518
aVAll I can say is that it is\u000athe exact truth."
p3519
aV"I cannot keep you in my employ any longer.
p3520
aVI have been deceived by\u000ayou, and should no longer trust you.
p3521
aVYou certainly have mistaken your\u000avocation.
p3522
aVYou are not fit to be a stable boy."
p3523
aV"I should like to know what I am fit for," said Tony, despondently.
p3524
aV"I will tell you, then.
p3525
aVJudging from the story you have told me, I\u000ashould think you might succeed very well in writing a romance.
p3526
aVI don't\u000aknow whether it pays, but you can try it."
p3527
aV"Some time you will find out that I have told the truth," said Tony.
p3528
aV"Perhaps so, but I doubt it."
p3529
aV"When do you want me to go?"
p3530
aV"You can stay till to-morrow morning.
p3531
aVWait a minute.
p3532
aVHere is a\u000afive-dollar bill.
p3533
aVThat is a fair price for the time you have been with\u000ame."
p3534
aVAs Tony was going out he came near having a collision with Sam Payson.
p3535
aVSam looked at him inquiringly.
p3536
aV"Have you been discharged?"
p3537
aVhe asked.
p3538
aV"Yes," said Tony.
p3539
aV"It was your fault.
p3540
aVWhat made you take that horse?"
p3541
aV"I was afraid Mr. Porter might lose it.
p3542
aVIs he in?"
p3543
aV"Yes.
p3544
aVYou can apply for my place, if you want to."
p3545
aV"I mean to."
p3546
aVSam went in, and addressed the landlord.
p3547
aV"I brought your horse back," he said.
p3548
aV"Thank you.
p3549
aVHere's two dollars for your trouble."
p3550
aVSam tucked it away with an air of satisfaction.
p3551
aV"Tony tells me he is going away."
p3552
aV"Yes.
p3553
aVHe don't suit me."
p3554
aV"Wouldn't I suit you?"
p3555
aVasked Sam, in an ingratiating tone.
p3556
aV"No; I've tried you, and you won't suit," was the unexpected reply.
p3557
aV"But I brought back the horse," pleaded Sam, crest-fallen.
p3558
aV"I've paid you for that," said the landlord.
p3559
aV"Didn't I pay you enough?"
p3560
aV"Yes, sir; but I thought you'd take me back again."
p3561
aV"I know you too well, Sam Payson, to try any such experiment.
p3562
aVThe Widow\u000aClark told me yesterday that she wanted to get her boy into a place,\u000aand I am going to offer it to him."
p3563
aV"He don't know anything about horses," said Sam.
p3564
aV"He will soon learn.
p3565
aVHe is a good boy, and industrious.
p3566
aVI am sure he\u000awill suit me better than you."
p3567
aV"I wish I hadn't brought back his old horse," muttered Sam, as he left\u000athe office and went back into the yard.
p3568
aVHe hoped to triumph over Tony\u000aby telling him that he had taken his place, but the opportunity was not\u000aallowed him.
p3569
aV"Well, Sam, are you going to take my place?"
p3570
aVasked Tony.
p3571
aV"No, I'm not," said Sam.
p3572
aV"Didn't you ask for it?"
p3573
aV"The old man had promised it to another boy," said Sam, sourly.
p3574
aV"He's been pretty quick about it, then," said James.
p3575
aV"A boy that don't know the first thing about horses," grumbled Sam.
p3576
aV"Who is it?"
p3577
aV"Joe Clark."
p3578
aV"He's a good boy; I'm glad he's coming, though I'm sorry to lose Tony."
p3579
aV"Thank you, James," said Tony.
p3580
aV"I'd like to stay, but I can't blame Mr.\u000aPorter for not believing my story.
p3581
aVIt was a strange one, but it's true\u000afor all that."
p3582
aVJames shrugged his shoulders.
p3583
aV"Then you believe you're heir to a fortune, as he told you?"
p3584
aV"Yes; he had no reason to tell me a lie."
p3585
aV"What's that?"
p3586
aVasked Sam.
p3587
aV"The Quaker gentleman who was here told Tony that he was heir to a\u000alarge fortune."
p3588
aV"Ho, ho!"
p3589
aVlaughed Sam, boisterously.
p3590
aV"That's a likely story, that is."
p3591
aV"Why isn't it?"
p3592
aVasked Tony, frowning.
p3593
aV"You heir to a fortune--a clodhopper like you!
p3594
aVOh!
p3595
aVI shall split!"
p3596
aVsaid\u000aSam, giving way to another burst of merriment.
p3597
aV"I am no more a clodhopper than you are," said Tony, "and I advise you\u000anot to laugh too much, or I may make you laugh on the other side of\u000ayour mouth."
p3598
aV"It'll take more than you to do it," said Sam, defiantly.
p3599
aV"I have done it already, Sam Payson, and I'm ready to try it again\u000abefore I leave town."
p3600
aV"I wouldn't dirty my hands with you," said Sam, scornfully.
p3601
aV"You'd better not."
p3602
aVWhen Sam had gone, Tony turned to James.
p3603
aV"I wonder whether I shall ever see you again, James?"
p3604
aVhe said,\u000athoughtfully.
p3605
aV"I hope so, Tony.
p3606
aVI'm sorry you're going; but you couldn't expect Mr.\u000aPorter to believe such a story as that."
p3607
aV"Then you don't believe it, James?
p3608
aVI'll come back some day just to\u000aprove to you that it is true."
p3609
aV"Come back at any rate; I shall be glad to see you.
p3610
aVWhen do you go?"
p3611
aV"To-morrow morning."
p3612
aV"Where shall you go first?"
p3613
aV"To New York; but I'll help you till I go."
p3614
aVSo Tony did his work as usual for the remainder of the day.
p3615
aVHe felt\u000arather sober.
p3616
aVJust as he had found a home his evil genius, in the\u000acharacter of Rudolph, appeared and deprived him of it.
p3617
aVCHAPTER XXVIII.
p3618
aVTHE WORLD BEFORE HIM.
p3619
aVThough Tony was out of a place he was considerably better off than he\u000ahad generally been.
p3620
aVHe had five dollars in his pocket for the first\u000atime in his life.
p3621
aVA few weeks ago he would have considered himself rich\u000awith this amount, and would have been in high spirits.
p3622
aVBut now he took\u000aa different view of life.
p3623
aVHe had known what it was to have a settled\u000ahome, and to earn an honest living, and he had learned to like it.
p3624
aVBut\u000afortune was against him, and he must go.
p3625
aV"Good-by, James," he said, soberly, to the hostler the next morning.
p3626
aV"Good-by, Tony, and good luck," said the kind-hearted hostler.
p3627
aV"I hope I shall have good luck, but I don't expect it," said Tony.
p3628
aV"Pooh, nonsense!
p3629
aVYou're young, and the world is before you."
p3630
aV"That's so, James, but so far the world has been against me."
p3631
aV"Come here a minute, Tony," said James, lowering his voice.
p3632
aVAs Tony approached, he thrust a bank-note hastily into his hand.
p3633
aV"Take it," he said, quickly.
p3634
aV"I don't need it, and you may."
p3635
aVTony looked at the bill, and found it was a ten-dollar note.
p3636
aV"You're very kind, James," he said, touched by a kindness to which he\u000awas unaccustomed, "but I can't take it."
p3637
aV"Why not?
p3638
aVI shan't need it."
p3639
aV"Nor I, James.
p3640
aVI've got some money.
p3641
aVIt isn't much, but I'm used to\u000aroughing it.
p3642
aVI've done it all my life.
p3643
aVI always come down on my feet\u000alike a cat."
p3644
aV"But you may get hard up."
p3645
aV"If I do, I'll let you know."
p3646
aV"Will you promise that?"
p3647
aV"Honor bright."
p3648
aVSo James took back the money reluctantly, and Tony bade him good-by.
p3649
aVIt was a rainy day when Tony arrived in New York.
p3650
aVThe stores were\u000adeserted, and the clerks lounged idly behind the counter.
p3651
aVOnly those\u000awho were actually obliged to be out appeared in the streets.
p3652
aVIf Tony's\u000ahopes had been high they would have been lowered by the dreary weather.
p3653
aVHe wandered aimlessly about the streets, having no care about his\u000aluggage for he had brought none, looking about him listlessly.
p3654
aVHe found\u000ahimself after a while in the lower part of Broadway, not far from the\u000aBattery.
p3655
aVIt is here, as my city readers know, the most of the European\u000asteamer lines have their offices.
p3656
aVAt once Tony saw a figure that attracted his eager attention.
p3657
aVIt was Rudolph Rugg, his old comrade, and now bitter enemy.
p3658
aV"Where is he going?"
p3659
aVthought Tony.
p3660
aVThis question was soon solved.
p3661
aVRudolph entered the office of the Anchor Line of steamers.
p3662
aV"What can he want there?"
p3663
aVthought Tony.
p3664
aV"I'll watch him."
p3665
aVHe took a position near by, yet far enough off to avoid discovery,\u000aand waited patiently for Rudolph to reappear.
p3666
aVHe waited about fifteen\u000aminutes.
p3667
aVThen he saw the tramp come out with a paper in his hand, which\u000ahe appeared to regard with satisfaction.
p3668
aVHe turned and went up Broadway.
p3669
aVAs soon as he thought it safe Tony crossed the street and entered the\u000aoffice.
p3670
aVHe made his way up to the counter and inquired the price of\u000apassage.
p3671
aVThe rates were given him.
p3672
aV"Can you tell me," he asked, carelessly, "if a Mr. Rugg is going across\u000aon one of your steamers?"
p3673
aV"Mr. Rugg?
p3674
aVWhy, it is the man who just left the office."
p3675
aV"Did he buy a passage ticket?"
p3676
aV"Yes."
p3677
aV"When does he sail?"
p3678
aV"On Saturday."
p3679
aV"And where does he go?"
p3680
aV"To Liverpool, of course.
p3681
aVCan I sell you a ticket?"
p3682
aV"I haven't decided," said Tony.
p3683
aV"If you go, you will find it to your advantage to go by our line."
p3684
aV"I'll go by your line, if I go at all," said Tony.
p3685
aV"I wonder whether\u000ahe'd be so polite if he knew I had but three dollars and a quarter in\u000amy pocket?"
p3686
aVsaid our hero to himself.
p3687
aVThen he began to wonder how it happened that Rudolph was going.
p3688
aVFirst,\u000ait was a mystery where he could have obtained the money necessary for\u000athe purchase of a ticket.
p3689
aVNext, what could be his reason for leaving\u000aAmerica.
p3690
aV"Probably he has picked somebody's pocket," thought Tony.
p3691
aVThat disposed of the difficulty, but, as we know, Tony was mistaken.
p3692
aVIt\u000awas money that he had received for a worse deed, but Tony never thought\u000aof connecting the state of Rudolph's purse with the attempt that had\u000abeen made upon his own life.
p3693
aVWhen Tony came to think of it he felt glad that Rudolph was going\u000aabroad.
p3694
aVHe felt that his own life would be safer with an ocean flowing\u000abetween him and the man who latterly had exhibited such an intense\u000ahatred for him.
p3695
aVAs to his motive, why perhaps he thought that he would\u000abe safer in London than in New York.
p3696
aVTony bethought himself of securing a temporary home.
p3697
aVHe was not a\u000astranger in New York, and knew exactly where to go.
p3698
aVThere was a house\u000anot far from Greenwich street, where he had lodged more than once\u000abefore, and where he was known.
p3699
aVIt was far from a fashionable place,\u000abut the charge was small, and that was a necessary consideration with\u000aTony.
p3700
aVHe rang the bell, and the proprietor, a hard-favored woman of fifty,\u000acame to open it.
p3701
aV"How do you do, Mrs.
p3702
aVBlodgett?"
p3703
aVsaid Tony.
p3704
aV"Why, it's Tony," said the woman, not unkindly.
p3705
aV"Where have you been\u000athis long time?"
p3706
aV"In the country," answered our hero.
p3707
aV"And where is your father?"
p3708
aV"Do you mean the man I used to be with?"
p3709
aV"Yes.
p3710
aVHe was your father, wasn't he?"
p3711
aV"No.
p3712
aVHe was no relation of mine," said Tony, hastily.
p3713
aV"We used to go\u000atogether, that is all."
p3714
aV"Where is he?"
p3715
aV"I don't know exactly.
p3716
aVWe had a falling out, and we've parted."
p3717
aV"Well, Tony, what can I do for you?"
p3718
aV"Have you got any cheap room to let, Mrs.
p3719
aVBlodgett?"
p3720
aV"I've got a room in the attic.
p3721
aVIt's small, but if it'll suit you, you\u000acan have it for a dollar a week."
p3722
aV"It's just the thing," said Tony, in a tone of satisfaction.
p3723
aV"Can I go\u000aright up?"
p3724
aV"Yes, if you want to.
p3725
aVI generally want a week's pay in advance, but\u000ayou've been here before----"\u000a\u000a"No matter for that.
p3726
aVHere's the money," said Tony.
p3727
aV"I'll show you the way up."
p3728
aV"All right.
p3729
aVI guess I'll lie down awhile.
p3730
aVI've been about the streets\u000aall day, and am pretty tired."
p3731
aVThe room was quite small, and the furniture was shabby and well-worn;\u000abut Tony was not particular.
p3732
aVHe threw himself on the bed, and soon fell\u000aasleep.
p3733
aVHow long he slept he did not know, but when he woke up the room was\u000aquite dark.
p3734
aVHe stretched, and did not immediately remember where he\u000awas; but it flashed upon him directly.
p3735
aV"I wonder what time it is?"
p3736
aVhe asked himself.
p3737
aV"I must have slept a long\u000atime.
p3738
aVI feel as fresh as a lark.
p3739
aVI'll get up a take and tramp."
p3740
aVWhen he went down stairs he found that it was already ten o'clock.

aV"I feel as fresh as if it were morning," thought Tony.
p3742
aV"I'll go out on\u000aBroadway and watch some of the theatres when the people come out."
p3743
aVTen o'clock seems late in the country; it is the usual hour for\u000aretiring for many families; but in the city it is quite different.
p3744
aVThere are still many to be seen in the streets, and for many it is the\u000acommencement of a season of festivity.
p3745
aVTony walked for half an hour.
p3746
aVHe was so thoroughly rested that he\u000afelt no fatigue.
p3747
aVPresently he stepped into a crowded billiard-room,\u000aand seating himself, began to watch a game between a young man of\u000atwenty-five and a man probably fifteen years his senior.
p3748
aVThe first was\u000aevidently a gentleman by birth and education; his dress and manners\u000aevinced this.
p3749
aVThe other looked like an adventurer, though he was\u000awell-dressed.
p3750
aV"Come, let us play for drinks," said the elder.
p3751
aV"I've drank enough," said the young man.
p3752
aV"Nonsense.
p3753
aVYou can stand a little more."
p3754
aV"Just as you say."
p3755
aVThe game terminated in favor of the elder, and the drinks were brought.
p3756
aVThis went on for some time.
p3757
aVThe young man was evidently affected.
p3758
aVFinally he threw down his cue, and said;\u000a\u000a"I won't play again."
p3759
aV"Why not?"
p3760
aV"My hand is unsteady.
p3761
aVI have drank too much."
p3762
aV"I've drank as much as you, but I am all right."
p3763
aV"You can stand more than I. I'll settle for the drinks and games and go\u000ahome."
p3764
aV"Shan't I see you home?"
p3765
aVasked the elder.
p3766
aV"I don't want to trouble you."
p3767
aV"No trouble at all."
p3768
aVThe young man paid at the bar, displaying a well-filled pocketbook.
p3769
aVThere was something in his companion's expression which made Tony\u000asuspicious.
p3770
aVHe formed a sudden resolve.
p3771
aV"I'll follow them," he said, and when they left the room he was close\u000abehind them.
p3772
aVCHAPTER XXIX.
p3773
aVA STRANGE ADVENTURE.
p3774
aVThe young man leaned on the arm of his companion.
p3775
aVHe was affected\u000aby the potations in which he had indulged, and was sensible of his\u000acondition.
p3776
aV"I ought not to have drank so much," he said, in unsteady accents.
p3777
aV"Pooh!
p3778
aVit's nothing," said the other, lightly.
p3779
aV"Where are you stopping?"
p3780
aV"St.
p3781
aVNicholas."
p3782
aV"We'd better walk; it will do you good to walk."
p3783
aV"Just as you say."
p3784
aV"Of course, I would only advise you for your good."
p3785
aV"I know it; but old fellow, why did you make me drink so much?"
p3786
aV"I thought you could stand it better.
p3787
aVI'm as cool as a cucumber."
p3788
aVHe pressed the young man's arm, and led him into a side street.
p3789
aV"What's that for?
p3790
aVThis ain't the way to St.
p3791
aVNicholas."
p3792
aV"I know it."
p3793
aV"Why don't you go up Broadway?"
p3794
aV"You are not fit to go in yet.
p3795
aVYou need a longer walk, so that your\u000acondition will not be noticed when you go in."
p3796
aV"Go along old fellow; you're right."
p3797
aVStill Tony kept behind.
p3798
aVAll seemed right enough, but somehow he could\u000anot help feeling suspicious of the older man.
p3799
aV"I'll watch him," he thought, "and if he attempts any mischief I'll\u000ainterfere."
p3800
aVThe two men walked in a westerly direction, crossing several streets.
p3801
aV"Look here," said the young man, "we'd better turn back."
p3802
aVNow was the time.
p3803
aVThe other looked swiftly around, but did not notice Tony, who was\u000atracking him in the darkness.
p3804
aV"Give me your watch and money at once, or I'll blow your brains out."
p3805
aV"Look here, you're only trying to play a joke on me."
p3806
aV"You're mistaken.
p3807
aVI'm a desperate man.
p3808
aVI will do as I say."
p3809
aV"Then you're a villain," said the young man, with spirit.
p3810
aV"You've made\u000ame drunk in order to rob me."
p3811
aV"Precisely.
p3812
aVYour money or your life.
p3813
aVThat's about what I mean."
p3814
aV"I'll call the police."
p3815
aV"If you do it will be your last word.
p3816
aVNow make up your mind."
p3817
aVThe young man, instead of complying, endeavored to break away, but in\u000ahis intoxication he had lost half his strength, and was no match for\u000athe other.
p3818
aV"You fool!
p3819
aVyour blood be on your own hands!"
p3820
aVsaid his companion, and he\u000adrew a pistol from his side pocket.
p3821
aVAn instant and he would have fired, but Tony was on the alert.
p3822
aVHe\u000asprang forward, seized the would-be murderer by the arm, and the pistol\u000awent off, but the bullet struck a brick wall on the opposite side of\u000athe street.
p3823
aV"Police!"
p3824
aVshouted Tony, at the top of his lungs.
p3825
aV"Confusion!"
p3826
aVexclaimed the villain.
p3827
aV"I must be getting out of this."
p3828
aVHe turned to fly, but Tony seized him by the coat, and he struggled\u000afiercely, but in vain.
p3829
aV"Let go, you young scoundrel!"
p3830
aVhe shouted, "or I'll shoot you."
p3831
aV"With an unloaded pistol?"
p3832
aVasked Tony.
p3833
aV"That don't scare much."
p3834
aVA quick step was heard, and a policeman turned the corner.
p3835
aV"What's the matter?"
p3836
aVhe asked.
p3837
aV"I charge this man with an attempt at murder," said Tony.
p3838
aV"The boy is right," said the young man.
p3839
aV"They are both lying," said the adventurer, furiously.
p3840
aV"It's a plot\u000aagainst me."
p3841
aV"I know you, Bill Jones," said the policeman, after a careful scrutiny\u000aof the man's features.
p3842
aV"You're a hard ticket.
p3843
aVCome along with me.
p3844
aVYou\u000atwo must go with me to prefer your charge."
p3845
aV"Let me have your arm, my boy," said the young man; "I'm ashamed to own\u000athat I need your help.
p3846
aVIt is the last time I will allow liquor to get\u000athe better of me."
p3847
aV"I guess you're about right there," said Tony.
p3848
aV"You've had a narrow\u000aescape."
p3849
aV"I owe my life to you," said the young man, warmly.
p3850
aV"How did you happen\u000ato come up just in the nick of time?"
p3851
aV"I suspected the man meant you no good.
p3852
aVI followed you from the\u000abilliard saloon, where I saw you playing."
p3853
aV"You were sharper than I. I never suspected harm.
p3854
aVYou have done me the\u000agreatest possible service."
p3855
aV"Curse the young brat!"
p3856
aVmuttered the man in custody.
p3857
aV"I'd like a good\u000achance to wring your neck."
p3858
aV"I've no doubt of it," said Tony.
p3859
aV"I'll keep out of your way."
p3860
aVThe station house was not far off.
p3861
aVThe party entered.
p3862
aVThe charge was\u000aformally made, and Tony and the young man went out.
p3863
aV"Won't your father and mother feel anxious about your being out so\u000alate?"
p3864
aVasked George Spencer, for this was the young man's name.
p3865
aV"I don't think they will," answered Tony.
p3866
aV"I haven't got any for that\u000amatter."
p3867
aV"Who do you live with then?"
p3868
aV"I take care of myself."
p3869
aV"Have you no one belonging to you?"
p3870
aV"Not one."
p3871
aV"Are you poor?"
p3872
aVasked Spencer, for the first time taking notice of\u000aTony's rather shabby apparel.
p3873
aV"Oh, no," said our hero.
p3874
aV"I've got a little over two dollars in my\u000apocket."
p3875
aV"Is that all?"
p3876
aV"Yes, and it's a good deal more than I generally have."
p3877
aV"You don't say so.
p3878
aVHow do you make your living?"
p3879
aV"Any way I can.
p3880
aVAny way that's honest."
p3881
aV"And don't you ever get discouraged--down in the mouth?"
p3882
aV"Not often," answered Tony.
p3883
aV"I've always got along, and I guess\u000asomething will turn up for me.
p3884
aVBut there's one thing I'm sorry for."
p3885
aV"What's that?"
p3886
aV"I would like to get some sort of an education; I don't know much."
p3887
aV"Can you read?"
p3888
aV"A little, and write a little.
p3889
aVI mostly picked it up myself."
p3890
aVThe young man whistled.
p3891
aV"Have you any place to sleep to-night?"
p3892
aV"I've hired an attic room for a week."
p3893
aV"What do you pay?"
p3894
aV"A dollar a week."
p3895
aV"Of course, it's a poor room?"
p3896
aV"Yes; but it's all I can expect, and better than I often have.
p3897
aVWhy,\u000aI've slept in barns and under haystacks plenty of times."
p3898
aV"What is your name?"
p3899
aV"Tony Rugg."
p3900
aV"Well, Tony, you must come and stop with me to-night."
p3901
aV"With you?"
p3902
aV"Yes; at the St. Nicholas Hotel.
p3903
aVYou can help me get there, and share\u000amy room."
p3904
aVTony hesitated.
p3905
aV"Do you mean it?"
p3906
aVhe asked.
p3907
aV"Why shouldn't I?"
p3908
aV"Because you're a gentleman, and I--do you know what they call me?"
p3909
aV"What?"
p3910
aV"Tony, the Tramp."
p3911
aV"It is your misfortune and not your fault.
p3912
aVI repeat my invitation--will\u000ayou come?"
p3913
aV"I will," answered Tony.
p3914
aVHe saw that the young man was in earnest, and he no longer persisted in\u000ahis refusal.
p3915
aV"To-morrow morning I will talk with you further about your affairs.
p3916
aVI\u000awant to do something for you."
p3917
aV"You are very kind."
p3918
aV"I ought to be.
p3919
aVHaven't you saved my life?
p3920
aVBut there is the hotel."
p3921
aVTony and his new friend entered the great hotel.
p3922
aVIt was brilliantly\u000alighted, though it was now nearly midnight.
p3923
aVMr. Spencer went up to the desk.
p3924
aV"My key," he said; "No.
p3925
aV169."
p3926
aV"Here it is, sir."
p3927
aV"This young man will share my room; I will enter his name."
p3928
aVThe clerk looked at Tony in surprise.
p3929
aVHe looked rather shabby for a\u000aguest of the great caravansery.
p3930
aV"Has he luggage?"
p3931
aVasked the clerk.
p3932
aV"None to-night; I will pay his bill."
p3933
aV"All right, sir."
p3934
aVThey got into the elevator, and presently came to a stop.
p3935
aVMr. Spencer\u000aopened the door of 169.
p3936
aVIt was a good-sized and handsomely furnished chamber, containing two\u000abeds.
p3937
aV"You will sleep in that bed, Tony," said Spencer.
p3938
aV"I feel dead tired.
p3939
aVWill you help me off with my coat?"
p3940
aVScarcely was the young man in bed than he fell asleep.
p3941
aVTony lay awake\u000asome time, thinking of his strange adventure.
p3942
aV"It's the first time in my life," he said to himself, "when I've had\u000atwo beds--one here and the other at my lodgings.
p3943
aVWhat would Rudolph say\u000aif he knew I was stopping at a fashionable hotel, instead of being at\u000athe bottom of the well, where he threw me?"
p3944
aVCHAPTER XXX.
p3945
aVBREAKFAST AT THE ST. NICHOLAS.
p3946
aVWhen Tony woke up in the morning he looked about him with momentary\u000abewilderment, wondering where he was.
p3947
aVGeorge Spencer was already awake.
p3948
aV"How did you sleep, Tony?"
p3949
aVhe asked.
p3950
aV"First rate."
p3951
aV"It must be late.
p3952
aVPlease look at my watch and tell me what time it is."
p3953
aV"Half-past eight," said Tony, complying with his request.
p3954
aV"Why, it's\u000alate."
p3955
aV"Not very.
p3956
aVI didn't get up until ten yesterday.
p3957
aVWell, what do you say\u000ato getting up and having some breakfast?"
p3958
aV"Am I to breakfast with you, Mr.
p3959
aVSpencer?"
p3960
aV"To be sure you are, unless you have another engagement," added\u000aSpencer, jocosely.
p3961
aV"If I have it can wait," said Tony.
p3962
aV"How much do they charge here for\u000aboard, Mr.
p3963
aVSpencer?"
p3964
aV"Four or five dollars a day.
p3965
aVI really don't know exactly how much."
p3966
aV"Four or five dollars a day!"
p3967
aVexclaimed Tony, opening his eyes in\u000aamazement.
p3968
aV"How much I shall cost you!"
p3969
aV"I expect you will cost me a good deal, Tony," said the young man.
p3970
aV"Do\u000ayou know, I have a great mind to adopt you!"
p3971
aV"Do you really mean it, Mr.
p3972
aVSpencer?"
p3973
aV"Yes; why shouldn't I. I like what I have seen of you, and I have\u000aplenty of money."
p3974
aV"It must be a nice thing to have plenty of money," said Tony,\u000athoughtfully.
p3975
aV"There is danger in it, too, Tony.
p3976
aVI am ashamed to tell you how much I\u000ahave spent in gambling and dissipation."
p3977
aV"I wouldn't do it, Mr. Spencer," said Tony, soberly.
p3978
aV"Capital advice, Tony.
p3979
aVI am going to keep you with me for fear I might\u000aforget, that is, if you think you will like me well enough to stay."
p3980
aV"I am sure to like you, Mr. Spencer, but you may get tired of me."
p3981
aV"I'll let you know when I do, Tony.
p3982
aVHow much income do you think I\u000ahave?"
p3983
aV"A thousand dollars!"
p3984
aVguessed Tony, who considered that this would be a\u000avery large income.
p3985
aVSpencer laughed.
p3986
aV"It is over ten thousand," he said.
p3987
aV"Ten thousand!"
p3988
aVexclaimed Tony.
p3989
aV"How can you spend it all?"
p3990
aV"I did spend it all, last year, Tony, and got a thousand dollars in\u000adebt.
p3991
aVI gambled, and most of it went that way.
p3992
aVBut I'll leave that off.
p3993
aVI shall have you to take up my time, now."
p3994
aV"Did you know that man you played billiards with last night, Mr.
p3995
aVSpencer?"
p3996
aV"I made his acquaintance in a gambling house, and I was well punished\u000afor keeping company with such a man."
p3997
aVTony was now nearly dressed.
p3998
aV"You didn't get your clothing from a fashionable tailor, I should\u000ajudge," said his new guardian.
p3999
aV"No," said Tony, "I haven't been to fashionable tailors much."
p4000
aV"After breakfast I must go with you and see you properly clothed.
p4001
aVIf\u000ayou are to be my ward, I must have your appearance do me credit."
p4002
aV"How very kind you are to me, Mr. Spencer," said Tony, gratefully.
p4003
aV"I\u000adon't know how to repay you."
p4004
aV"You've done something in that way already."
p4005
aV"It seems like a dream that a poor boy like me should be adopted by a\u000arich gentleman."
p4006
aV"It is a dream you won't wake up from very soon.
p4007
aVNow if you are ready\u000awe will go down to breakfast."
p4008
aVTony hung back.
p4009
aV"Won't you be ashamed to have me seen with you in these clothes?"
p4010
aVhe\u000aasked.
p4011
aV"Not a bit.
p4012
aVBesides you will soon be in better trim.
p4013
aVCome along, Tony."
p4014
aVThey went down together, and entered the breakfast room.
p4015
aVA considerable\u000anumber of persons were there.
p4016
aVSeveral stared in surprise at Tony as he\u000aentered and took his seat.
p4017
aVOur hero noticed it, and it made him nervous.
p4018
aV"Do you see how they look at me?"
p4019
aVhe said.
p4020
aV"Don't let it affect your appetite, Tony," said his friend.
p4021
aV"When you\u000aappear among them again you will have no reason to feel ashamed."
p4022
aVA speech which Tony heard from a neighboring table did not serve to\u000areassure him.
p4023
aVAn over-dressed lady of fifty said to a tall, angular young lady, her\u000adaughter:\u000a\u000a"Elvira, do you see that very common-looking boy at the next table?"
p4024
aV"Yes, ma."
p4025
aV"He looks low.
p4026
aVHe is not as well dressed as our servants.
p4027
aVIt is very\u000astrange they should let him eat at an aristocratic hotel like this."
p4028
aV"Isn't he with that gentleman, ma?"
p4029
aV"It looks like it.
p4030
aVHe maybe the gentleman's servant.
p4031
aVI really think it\u000aan imposition to bring him here."
p4032
aVMr. Spencer smiled.
p4033
aV"Don't mind it, Tony," he said.
p4034
aV"I know those people by sight.
p4035
aVThey\u000aare parvenus.
p4036
aVI suppose you don't understand the word.
p4037
aVThey are vulgar\u000apeople who have become rich by a lucky speculation.
p4038
aVThey will change\u000atheir tune presently.
p4039
aVWhat will you have for breakfast?"
p4040
aV"There's such a lot of things," said Tony, "I don't know what to\u000achoose."
p4041
aV"You'll get used to that.
p4042
aVI'll order breakfast for both."
p4043
aVThe waiter appeared, and Mr. Spencer gave the order.
p4044
aVThe waiter looked uncomfortable.
p4045
aV"Mr. Spencer," he said, "it's against the rules for you to bring your\u000aservant to the table with you."
p4046
aV"I have not done so," said Mr. Spencer, promptly.
p4047
aV"This young gentleman\u000ais my ward."
p4048
aV"Oh, excuse me," said the waiter, confused.
p4049
aV"Has any one prompted you to speak to me about him?"
p4050
aV"Those ladies at the next table."
p4051
aV"Then those ladies owe an apology to my ward," said the young man, loud\u000aenough for the ladies to hear.
p4052
aVThe shot told.
p4053
aVThe ladies looked confused and embarrassed, and Tony and\u000ahis guardian quietly finished their breakfast.
p4054
aVThere was another lady who noticed Tony, and this was Mrs. Harvey\u000aMiddleton.
p4055
aVShe was to sail for England in the afternoon.
p4056
aVAs Tony and Mr. Spencer were going out of the breakfast-room, they met\u000aher entering.
p4057
aVShe started at the sight of Tony, and scanned his face eagerly.
p4058
aV"Who are you, boy?"
p4059
aVshe asked, quickly, laying her hand on his arm.
p4060
aVTony was too surprised to answer, and Mr. Spencer answered for him.
p4061
aV"It is my ward, madame," he answered.
p4062
aV"He has been roughing it in the\u000acountry, which accounts for the state of his wardrobe."
p4063
aV"O, I beg pardon, sir," said Mrs. Middleton.
p4064
aV"I thought his face looked\u000afamiliar."
p4065
aV"You see, Tony, that your appearance attracts attention," said Mr.\u000aSpencer, laughing.
p4066
aV"Now we'll go out, and I'll get you a fit-out."
p4067
aVThey went to a well-known clothier's, and Mr. Spencer purchased two\u000ahandsome suits for our hero, one of which he put on at once.
p4068
aVAt another\u000aplace a plentiful supply of under-clothing was purchased.
p4069
aVNext a hat\u000aand shoes were procured.
p4070
aVTony's hair was cut, he took a bath, and\u000ain a couple of hours he was transformed into a young gentleman of\u000adistinguished appearance.
p4071
aV"Really, Tony, I shouldn't have known you," said his friend.
p4072
aV"I shouldn't have known myself," said Tony.
p4073
aV"I almost think it must be\u000asome other boy.
p4074
aVWho'd think I was Tony, the Tramp, now?"
p4075
aV"You are not to be a tramp any longer.
p4076
aVI have not yet formed my plans\u000afor you, but I shall soon.
p4077
aVI suppose, Tony, your education has been\u000aneglected."
p4078
aV"I should think it had," answered Tony.
p4079
aV"I'm as ignorant as a horse."
p4080
aV"Then you ought to learn something."
p4081
aV"I wish I could."
p4082
aV"You shall, but, as I said, I must arrange details later."
p4083
aV*       *       *       *       *       *       *\u000a\u000aAbout this time Rudolph and Mrs. Middleton were conversing, preparatory\u000ato starting for the steamer.
p4084
aV"You are sure the boy is dead?"
p4085
aVshe said.
p4086
aV"Sure?
p4087
aVI ought to be.
p4088
aVDidn't I see him dead with my own eyes?"
p4089
aV"I saw a boy this morning who looked as I suppose the boy would have\u000alooked--of the same age, too."
p4090
aV"Where did you see him?"
p4091
aV"He was with a gentleman, coming out of the breakfast-room as I was\u000aentering it."
p4092
aV"It couldn't have been he," said Rudolph, positively.
p4093
aV"Even if he were\u000aalive, he wouldn't be here.
p4094
aVBut he's dead, I tell you.
p4095
aVThere's no doubt\u000aof it."
p4096
aV"There are strange resemblances," said the lady.
p4097
aV"But, of course, it\u000acouldn't have been the boy.
p4098
aVIndeed, the gentleman with him told me that\u000ait was his ward."
p4099
aVRudolph laughed.
p4100
aV"Tony wasn't likely to have a gentleman for a guardian," he said.
p4101
aVBut Rudolph would have felt less easy in his mind if he had known that\u000athe boy whom he supposed dead at the bottom of a well was really in the\u000ahotel at that very moment.
p4102
aVCHAPTER XXXI.
p4103
aVTONY AND HIS GUARDIAN SET UP HOUSEKEEPING.
p4104
aV"Now, Tony," said George Spencer, after dinner, "I want to tell you\u000awhat plans I have formed for you and myself.
p4105
aVI have got tired of hotel\u000alife, and want a home.
p4106
aVI shall seek a couple of handsomely-furnished\u000arooms up town, make it social and pleasant with books and pictures, and\u000awe will settle down and enjoy ourselves."
p4107
aV"I am afraid you will get tired of me, Mr. Spencer," said Tony,\u000amodestly.
p4108
aV"I am too ignorant to be much company for you."
p4109
aV"Ignorance, like poverty, can be remedied," said the young man.
p4110
aV"I\u000ashall obtain a private tutor for you, and expect you to spend some\u000ahours daily in learning."
p4111
aVTony's face brightened up.
p4112
aV"That is just what I would like," he said.
p4113
aV"You would like it better than going to school?"
p4114
aV"Yes, for at school I should be obliged to go into a class with much\u000ayounger boys."
p4115
aV"While with a tutor you can go on as fast as you please."
p4116
aV"Yes, sir."
p4117
aV"To-night we both need a little recreation.
p4118
aVSuppose we go to some place\u000aof amusement.
p4119
aVHave you ever been to Barnum's?"
p4120
aV"Yes, sir, but I didn't take a reserved seat."
p4121
aV"I suppose not."
p4122
aV"I sat in the upper gallery."
p4123
aV"To-night you shall be fashionable.
p4124
aVHave you a pair of kid gloves?"
p4125
aV"The last pair I had is worn out," said Tony, laughing.
p4126
aV"Then you must have another pair.
p4127
aVWe will get a pair on our way there."
p4128
aVIt was already time to start.
p4129
aVAt eight o'clock Tony found himself occupying an orchestra chair near\u000athe stage, his hands encased in a pair of gloves of faultless fit,\u000aand looking enough like a young patrician to pass muster among his\u000afashionable neighbors.
p4130
aV"How does it seem, Tony?"
p4131
aVasked Spencer, smiling.
p4132
aV"Tip-top," answered Tony: "but how queer kid gloves feel.
p4133
aVI never had a\u000apair on in my life before."
p4134
aV"There are the two ladies who found fault with your appearance at the\u000abreakfast table this morning."
p4135
aV"They are looking at me through an opera-glass."
p4136
aV"Wondering if you can be the same boy.
p4137
aVI have no doubt they are puzzled\u000ato account for your transformation."
p4138
aVMr. Spencer was right.
p4139
aVThe two ladies were at the same moment\u000aexchanging remarks about our hero.
p4140
aV"Goodness, Elvira!
p4141
aVthere is that boy that was at breakfast this morning\u000aat the hotel."
p4142
aV"The boy that was so shabbily dressed, mamma?
p4143
aVWhere?"
p4144
aV"Just to the left.
p4145
aVHe isn't shabby now.
p4146
aVSee how he is decked out.
p4147
aVWho\u000awould have thought it?"
p4148
aV"It's queer, isn't it?"
p4149
aV"I think we must have been mistaken about him.
p4150
aVHe looks like a young\u000agentleman now.
p4151
aVBut why should he have worn such clothes before?"
p4152
aV"I can't tell, I am sure."
p4153
aV"That's a nice-looking young man, Elvira.
p4154
aVI wish he would take a fancy\u000ato you."
p4155
aV"La!
p4156
aVmamma, how you talk," said Elvira, bridling and smiling.
p4157
aV"Depend upon it, Tony, those ladies will be polite to you if they get a\u000achance," said Spencer, laughing.
p4158
aV"It makes a great deal of difference how a boy is dressed," said Tony.
p4159
aV"You are right, Tony.
p4160
aVRemember you are fashionable now."
p4161
aV"There's a gentleman in front that I know," said Tony, suddenly.
p4162
aV"Where."
p4163
aV"The man with a partly bald head."
p4164
aV"How do you know him?"
p4165
aV"He was staying two or three days at the country hotel where I was\u000astable boy."
p4166
aV"Do you think he would know you now?"
p4167
aV"May I see?"
p4168
aV"Yes, but don't let him find you out.
p4169
aVIt won't do in society to let it\u000abe known that you were ever a stable-boy."
p4170
aV"All right."
p4171
aVTony leaned over, and addressing the gentleman, said:\u000a\u000a"Would you be kind enough to lend me your programme a minute, sir?"
p4172
aV"Certainly," was the reply.
p4173
aVThen, looking at Tony: "Your face looks\u000avery familiar.
p4174
aVWhere have I seen you before?"
p4175
aV"Perhaps at the St. Nicholas, sir," said Tony; "I am stopping there."
p4176
aV"No; I never go to the St. Nicholas.
p4177
aVBless me!
p4178
aVYou're the very image of\u000aa boy I have seen somewhere."
p4179
aV"Am I?"
p4180
aVsaid Tony.
p4181
aV"I hope he was good-looking?"
p4182
aV"He was; but he was not dressed like you.
p4183
aVIn fact--I remember now--he\u000awas employed as stable-boy in a country hotel."
p4184
aV"A stable boy!"
p4185
aVexclaimed Tony, with comic horror.
p4186
aV"I hope you don't\u000athink I am the boy."
p4187
aV"Of course not.
p4188
aVBut really the resemblance is striking."
p4189
aV"Mr. Spencer," said Tony, "this gentleman has met a stable boy who\u000alooks like me."
p4190
aV"I really beg your pardon," said the gentleman; "I meant no offense."
p4191
aV"My ward would not think of taking offense," said Mr. Spencer,\u000acourteously.
p4192
aVTony smiled to himself; he had a strong sense of humor, and was much\u000aamused.
p4193
aVIt is needless to say that he enjoyed the performance--all the more so\u000afrom his luxurious seat and nearness to the stage.
p4194
aV"It's a good deal better than sitting in the gallery," he said, in a\u000awhisper to his companion.
p4195
aV"I should think so.
p4196
aVI never sat up there, Tony."
p4197
aV"And I never sat anywhere else."
p4198
aVAs they were leaving the house, they found themselves close to the\u000aladies whom they had noticed at breakfast.
p4199
aVElvira chanced to drop her handkerchief, probably intentionally.
p4200
aVTony stooped and picked it up.
p4201
aVThough he had led the life of a tramp,\u000ahe had the instincts of a gentleman.
p4202
aV"Thank you, young gentleman," said Elvira.
p4203
aV"You are very polite."
p4204
aV"Oh, don't mention it," said Tony.
p4205
aV"Really, Mamma, he is a born gentleman," said Elvira, later, to her\u000amother.
p4206
aV"How could we make such a mistake."
p4207
aV"His clothes were certainly very shabby, my dear."
p4208
aV"Very likely he had been out hunting or something.
p4209
aVWe must not judge so\u000ahastily next time."
p4210
aVThe ladies were foiled in their intentions of cultivating the\u000aacquaintance of Tony and his guardian, as two days later they left\u000athe hotel, and installed themselves in an elegant boarding-house on\u000aMadison avenue.
p4211
aV"Now," said Mr. Spencer, "we must go to work."
p4212
aV"I must," said Tony.
p4213
aV"And I too," said Spencer.
p4214
aV"What can you have to do?"
p4215
aV"I have received a proposal to invest a part of my money--only\u000aone-fourth--in a business down town, and shall accept.
p4216
aVI don't need\u000ato increase my income, but I think I shall be less likely to yield to\u000atemptation if I have some fixed employment.
p4217
aVI shall be so situated\u000athat I can do as much or as little as I please.
p4218
aVAs to yourself I have\u000aput an advertisement in a morning paper for a teacher, and expect some\u000aapplicants this morning.
p4219
aVI want you to choose for yourself."
p4220
aV"I am afraid I shan't be a very good judge of teachers.
p4221
aVShall I examine\u000athem to see if they know enough?"
p4222
aV"I think, from what you say of your ignorance, that any of them will\u000aknow enough to teach you for the present.
p4223
aVThe main thing is to select\u000aone who knows how to teach, and whom you will like."
p4224
aV"I wish you were a teacher, Mr.
p4225
aVSpencer."
p4226
aV"Why?"
p4227
aV"Because then I should have a teacher whom I liked."
p4228
aV"Thank you, Tony," said the young man, evidently gratified.
p4229
aV"The liking\u000ais mutual.
p4230
aVI think myself fortunate in having you for my companion."
p4231
aV"The luck is on my side, Mr. Spencer.
p4232
aVWhat would I be but for you.
p4233
aVI\u000awouldn't be a tramp any more, for I am tired enough of that, but I\u000ashould have to earn my living as a newsboy or a bootblack, and have no\u000achance of getting an education."
p4234
aVSo the relations between Tony and his new friend became daily more\u000aclose, until Mr. Spencer came to regard him as a young brother, in\u000awhose progress he was warmly interested.
p4235
aVA tutor was selected, and Tony began to study.
p4236
aVHis ambition was roused.
p4237
aVHe realized for the first time how ignorant he was, and it is not too\u000amuch to say that he learned in one month as much as most boys learn in\u000athree.
p4238
aVHe got rid of the uncouth words he had acquired in early life,\u000aand adapted his manners to the new position which he found himself\u000aoccupying in society.
p4239
aVMr. Spencer, too, was benefited by his new\u000afriend.
p4240
aVHe gave up drink and dissipation, and contented himself with\u000apleasures in which he could invite Tony to participate.
p4241
aVMeanwhile Mrs. Harvey Middleton and Rudolph had arrived in England, and\u000awe must leave our hero, for a time and join them.
p4242
aVCHAPTER XXXII.
p4243
aVHOME AGAIN.
p4244
aVWhen Mrs. Harvey Middleton reached England, she delayed but a day\u000ain London to attend to necessary business.
p4245
aVThis business was solely\u000aconnected with her mission to America.
p4246
aVRudolph Rugg accompanied her to\u000athe chambers of a well-known lawyer, and testified to having had the\u000acharge of Tony, closing with the description of his death.
p4247
aVOf course\u000anothing was said of the well, or about his having thrown him in, for\u000aRudolph was not a fool.
p4248
aVThe details of a probable story had been got\u000aup by Mrs. Middleton and Rugg in concert.
p4249
aVAccording to them and the\u000awritten testimony, Tony had been run over by a train on the Erie\u000arailway, and a newspaper paragraph describing such an accident to an\u000aunknown boy was produced in corroboration.
p4250
aVIt was an ingenious fabrication, and Mrs. Middleton plumed herself upon\u000ait.
p4251
aV"Poor boy!"
p4252
aVshe said, with a hypocritical sigh, "his was a sad fate."
p4253
aV"It was, indeed," said the lawyer; "but," he added, dryly, "you have no\u000acause to regret it, since it secures the estate."
p4254
aV"Don't mention it, Mr. Brief.
p4255
aVIt is sad to profit by such a tragedy."
p4256
aV"You don't take a business view of it, madame.
p4257
aVSuch things happen, and\u000aif we can't prevent them, we may as well profit by them."
p4258
aV"Of course I will not refuse what has fallen in my way," said Mrs.\u000aMiddleton; "but I had formed the plan, if I found the boy alive, of\u000abringing him home and educating him for his position.
p4259
aVHe would not have\u000alet me want."
p4260
aV"Don't she do it well, though?"
p4261
aVthought Rudolph, who heard all this\u000awith a cynical admiration for the ex-governess.
p4262
aV"If I was a gentleman,\u000aI'd make up to her, and make her Mrs. Rugg if she'd say the word."
p4263
aV"You think this man's evidence will substantiate my claim to the\u000aestate?"
p4264
aVshe asked, after a pause.
p4265
aV"I should say there was no doubt on that point, unless, of course, his\u000aevidence is impeached or contradicted."
p4266
aV"That is hardly likely, Mr. Brief.
p4267
aVThe poor man suffered much at the\u000adeath of the boy, to whom he was ardently attached."
p4268
aV"So you loved the boy, Mr.
p4269
aVRugg?"
p4270
aVsaid the lawyer.
p4271
aV"Oh, uncommon," said Rudolph.
p4272
aV"He was my pet, and the apple of my eye.
p4273
aVWe was always together, Tony and I."
p4274
aV"And I suppose he loved you."
p4275
aV"He couldn't bear me out of his sight; he looked upon me as a father,\u000asir."
p4276
aV"If he'd come into the estate, he would probably have provided for\u000ayou," suggested the lawyer, watching him keenly.
p4277
aV"It's likely, sir.
p4278
aVI wish he had."
p4279
aV"So it's a personal loss to you--the death of the boy."
p4280
aV"Yes, sir."
p4281
aV"Mrs. Middleton probably will not forget your services to the boy."
p4282
aV"No, sir.
p4283
aVI shall, of course, do something for Mr. Rugg, though not as\u000amuch, perhaps, as my poor cousin would have done.
p4284
aVMr. Rugg, will you\u000asee me to my carriage?"
p4285
aV"Certainly, ma'am."
p4286
aVMrs. Middleton was anxious to go away.
p4287
aVThe conversation had taken a\u000aturn which she did not like.
p4288
aVIt almost seemed as if the lawyer was\u000atrying to find out something, and she thought it best to get Rudolph\u000aaway from the influence, lest Mr. Brief should catechise him, and draw\u000aout something to her disadvantage.
p4289
aV"Mr. Rugg," she said, as they were going down stairs, "I advise you not\u000ato go near Mr. Brief again."
p4290
aV"Why not, ma'am?"
p4291
aV"These lawyers are crafty.
p4292
aVBefore you knew what he was after, he would\u000aextract the secret from you, and there would be trouble for both of us."
p4293
aV"Do you think so, ma'am?
p4294
aVI didn't see nothing of it?"
p4295
aV"I think he suspects something.
p4296
aVThat matters nothing if it does not go\u000abeyond suspicion.
p4297
aVUnless he can impeach your testimony and draw you\u000ainto contradictions, we are safe, and you are sure of an income for\u000alife."
p4298
aV"You needn't be afraid for me, ma'am.
p4299
aVWe are in the same boat."
p4300
aVShe frowned a little at the familiar tone in which he spoke.
p4301
aVIt\u000awas as if he put himself on an equality with her.
p4302
aVBut it was true,\u000anevertheless, and it was unpleasant for her to think of.
p4303
aVWas there nothing else that was unpleasant?
p4304
aVDid she not think of the\u000apoor boy who, as she thought, was killed, and at her instigation?
p4305
aVYes,\u000ashe thought often of him, but as much as she could she kept the subject\u000aaway from her thoughts.
p4306
aV"He's better off," she said to herself.
p4307
aV"He didn't know anything of the\u000aproperty, and he wasn't fit to possess it.
p4308
aVAll the troubles of life are\u000aover for him."
p4309
aV"What are your plans, Mr.
p4310
aVRugg?"
p4311
aVshe asked.
p4312
aV"I have a mind to go down to Middleton Hall with you, ma'am.
p4313
aVI used to\u000alive there years ago, and I might find some of my old cronies."
p4314
aV"For that very reason you must not go," she said, hastily.
p4315
aV"They\u000awould be asking you all sorts of questions, and you'd be letting out\u000asomething."
p4316
aV"They wouldn't get nothing out of me."
p4317
aV"If you made no answer it would be as bad.
p4318
aVThey would suspect you."
p4319
aV"And you, too."
p4320
aV"Precisely."
p4321
aV"It's rather hard, Mrs. Middleton, I can't see my old friends."
p4322
aV"You can make new ones.
p4323
aVA man with money can always find friends."
p4324
aV"That's true, ma'am," said Rudolph, brightening up.
p4325
aV"Then you'd\u000arecommend me to stay in London?"
p4326
aV"In London, or anywhere else that you like better.
p4327
aVOnly don't come\u000awithin twenty miles of Middleton Hall."
p4328
aV"Well, ma'am, you're wiser than I am, and you know better what it's\u000abest to do."
p4329
aV"Of course I do.
p4330
aVYou are safe in being guided by me."
p4331
aV"But about the money, ma'am.
p4332
aVHow am I to get that if I don't see you?"
p4333
aV"Once a quarter I will pay in forty pounds to your account at any bank\u000ayou choose.
p4334
aVYou can let me know."
p4335
aV"All right, ma'am.
p4336
aVIt's strange to me to think of having a bank\u000aaccount."
p4337
aV"It need not be strange henceforth.
p4338
aVAnd now, Mr. Rugg, we must part.
p4339
aVI must hasten down to Middleton Hall to look after the estate.
p4340
aVI have\u000abeen absent from it now for nearly three months."
p4341
aV"I suppose you are in a hurry to see your young man," said Rudolph,\u000awith a grin.
p4342
aV"Mr. Rugg," said the lady, haughtily, "I beg you will make no reference\u000ato my private affairs.
p4343
aVYou speak as if I were a nursery maid."
p4344
aV"I beg your pardon, ma'am.
p4345
aVNo offense was meant."
p4346
aV"Then none is taken.
p4347
aVBut remember my caution."
p4348
aVShe stepped into the hansom which was waiting for her, and Rudolph\u000aremained standing on the sidewalk.
p4349
aV"She's puttin' on airs," said the tramp, frowning.
p4350
aV"She forgets all\u000aabout her bein' a governess once, without five pounds in the world.
p4351
aVShe\u000aacts as if she were a lady born.
p4352
aVI don't like it.
p4353
aVShe may try her airs\u000aon others, but not on Rudolph Rugg.
p4354
aVHe knows a little too much about\u000aMrs. Harvey Middleton.
p4355
aVRich as you are, you're in his power, and if he\u000awas so inclined he could bring you down from your high place, so he\u000acould."
p4356
aVBut Rudolph's anger was only transient.
p4357
aVHe was too astute not to\u000aunderstand clearly that he could not harm Mrs. Middleton without\u000aharming himself quite as much.
p4358
aVAs things stood, he was securely\u000aprovided for.
p4359
aVNo more tramping about the country for him in all\u000aweathers.
p4360
aVHe had enough to lodge and feed him, and provide all the beer\u000aand tobacco he could use.
p4361
aVThis was certainly a comfortable reflection.
p4362
aVSo he sought out a comfortable lodging and installed himself before\u000anight, determined to get what enjoyment he could out of London and the\u000aincome he had so foully won.
p4363
aVAnd Mrs. Middleton, she, too, congratulated herself.
p4364
aVShe leaned back in the cab and gave herself up to joyful anticipations\u000aof future happiness and security.
p4365
aV"Thank Heaven, I have got rid of that low fellow," she ejaculated,\u000ainwardly.
p4366
aV"I never want to see the brute again.
p4367
aVHe was necessary to\u000amy purpose, and I employed him, but I should be glad if he would get\u000adrowned, or be run over, or end his miserable life in some way, so that\u000aI might never see or hear of him again."
p4368
aVBut the thought of Rudolph did not long trouble her.
p4369
aVShe thought rather\u000aof the handsome Captain Lovell, whom she loved, and to marry whom she\u000ahad committed this crime, and the hard woman's face softened, and a\u000asmile crept over it.
p4370
aV"I shall soon see him, my Gregory," she murmured.
p4371
aV"He will soon be\u000amine, and I shall be repaid for my long, wearisome journey."
p4372
aVCHAPTER XXXIII.
p4373
aVCAPTAIN GREGORY LOVELL.
p4374
aVA carriage drove rapidly up the avenue leading to Middleton Hall.
p4375
aVThe hall was not large, but was handsome and well proportioned, and\u000alooked singularly attractive, its gray walls forming a harmonious\u000acontrast with the bright green ivy that partially covered them, and the\u000abroad, smooth lawn that stretched out in front.
p4376
aVMrs. Middleton regarded her home with unmingled satisfaction.
p4377
aVIt was\u000ato be her home now as long as she lived.
p4378
aVNow that the boy was dead no\u000aone could wrest it from her.
p4379
aVShe would live there, but not in solitary\u000agrandeur.
p4380
aVThe news of her success would bring Captain Gregory Lovell\u000ato her side, and their marriage would follow as soon as decency would\u000apermit.
p4381
aVIf afterward he should desire to have the name of the residence\u000achanged to Lovell Hall, Mrs. Middleton decided that she would not\u000aobject.
p4382
aVWhy should she?
p4383
aVShe had no superstitious love for her present\u000aname, while Lovell had for her the charm which love always gives to the\u000aname of the loved one.
p4384
aVThe housekeeper, stout and matronly, received her mistress at the door.
p4385
aV"Welcome home, Mrs. Middleton," she said; "how long it seems since you\u000awent away."
p4386
aV"How do you do, Sarah," said her mistress, graciously.
p4387
aV"I can assure\u000ayou I am glad to be back."
p4388
aV"You will find everything in order, mum, I hope and believe," said\u000aSarah.
p4389
aV"We expected to see you sooner."
p4390
aV"I hoped to be back sooner, but the business detained me longer than I\u000adesired."
p4391
aV"And did you succeed, mum, if I may be so bold," inquired the\u000ahousekeeper, curiously.
p4392
aV"As I expected, Sarah.
p4393
aVI found that the poor boy was dead."
p4394
aV"Indeed, mum."
p4395
aV"I hoped to bring him back with me, according to my poor husband's\u000adesire, but it was ordered otherwise by an inscrutable Providence."
p4396
aVSarah coughed.
p4397
aV"It is very sad," she said, but she looked curiously at her mistress.
p4398
aVShe knew very well that this sad news rejoiced the heart of Mrs.\u000aMiddleton, and the latter knew that she could not for a moment impose\u000aupon her clear-sighted housekeeper.
p4399
aVBut the farce must be kept up for\u000athe sake of appearances.
p4400
aV"Come up to my chamber with me, Sarah.
p4401
aVI want to ask you what has been\u000agoing on since I went away?
p4402
aVHave you heard from Lady Lovell's family?
p4403
aVAre they all well?"
p4404
aVLady Lovell was the mother of Captain Gregory Lovell, and the question\u000awas earnestly put.
p4405
aV"They are all well except the captain," answered Sarah.
p4406
aV"Is he sick?"
p4407
aVdemanded her mistress, turning upon her swiftly.
p4408
aV"No, mum; I only meant to say that the captain was gone away."
p4409
aV"Gone away!
p4410
aVWhen?
p4411
aVWhere?"
p4412
aV"He's ordered to India, I believe, mum.
p4413
aVHe went away a month ago."
p4414
aVMrs. Middleton sank into her chair, quite overcome.
p4415
aVHer joy was\u000aclouded, for the reward of her long and toilsome journey was snatched\u000afrom her.
p4416
aV"Did he not leave any message?"
p4417
aVshe asked.
p4418
aV"Did he not call before he\u000awent away?"
p4419
aV"Yes, mum.
p4420
aVHe left a note."
p4421
aV"Give it to me quick.
p4422
aVWhy did you not mention it to me before?"
p4423
aV"It's the first chance I got, mum.
p4424
aVThe letter is in my own chamber.
p4425
aVI\u000atook the best care of it.
p4426
aVI will get it directly."
p4427
aV"Do go, Sarah."
p4428
aVMrs. Middleton awaited the return of Sarah with nervous impatience.
p4429
aVPerhaps the captain had thrown her over, after all, and, loving him as\u000ashe did, this would have torn the heart of the intriguing woman, who,\u000acold and selfish as she was so far as others were concerned, really\u000aloved the handsome captain.
p4430
aVSarah speedily reappeared with the letter.
p4431
aV"Here it is, mum," she said.
p4432
aV"I have taken the best care of it."
p4433
aVMrs. Middleton tore it open with nervous haste This is the way it ran:\u000a\u000a\u000a     "MY DEAR JANE--I am about to set out for India--not\u000a     willingly, but my regiment is ordered there, and I must obey or\u000a     quit the service.
p4434
aVThis, as you well know, I cannot do; for apart\u000a     from my official pay, I have but a paltry two hundred pounds a\u000a     year, and that is barely enough to pay my tailor's bill.
p4435
aVI am\u000a     sorry to go away in your absence.
p4436
aVIf I were only sure you would\u000a     bring home good news, I could afford to sell my commission and\u000a     wait.
p4437
aVBut it is so uncertain that I cannot take the risk.
p4438
aV"I need not say, my dear Jane, how anxious I am to have all the\u000a     impediments to our union removed.
p4439
aVI am compelled to be mercenary.
p4440
aVIt is, alas!
p4441
aVnecessary for me, as a younger son, to marry a woman\u000a     with money.
p4442
aVI shall be happy, indeed, if interest and love go\u000a     hand in hand, as they will if your absolute claim to your late\u000a     husband's estate is proved beyond a doubt.
p4443
aVI append my India\u000a     address, and shall anxiously expect a communication from you on\u000a     your return.
p4444
aVIf you have been successful, I will arrange to return\u000a     at once, and our union can be solemnized without delay.
p4445
aVOnce more,\u000a     farewell.
p4446
aV"Your devoted\u000a     "GREGORY LOVELL."
p4447
aVMrs. Middleton, after reading this letter, breathed a sigh of relief.
p4448
aVHe was still hers, and she had only to call him back.
p4449
aVThere would be a\u000avexatious delay, but that must be submitted to.
p4450
aVShe had feared to lose\u000ahim, and this apprehension, at least, might be laid aside.
p4451
aVTo some the letter would have seemed too mercenary.
p4452
aVEven Mrs. Middleton\u000acould not help suspecting that, between love and interest, the latter\u000awas far the most powerful in the mind of Captain Lovell.
p4453
aVBut she\u000apurposely closed her eyes to this unpleasant suspicion.
p4454
aVShe was in love\u000awith the handsome captain, and it was the great object of her life to\u000abecome his wife.
p4455
aVShe decided to answer the letter immediately.
p4456
aVHer desk was at hand, and she opened it at once, and wrote a brief\u000aletter to her absent lover:\u000a\u000a\u000a     "DEAR GREGORY--I have just returned.
p4457
aVI am deeply\u000a     disappointed to find you absent, for, my darling, I have\u000a     succeeded.
p4458
aVI have legal proof--proof that cannot be disputed--that\u000a     the boy, my husband's cousin, is dead.
p4459
aVThe poor boy was\u000a     accidentally killed.
p4460
aVI have the sworn affidavit of the man who\u000a     took him to America, and who was his constant companion there.
p4461
aV"It is a sad fate for the poor boy.
p4462
aVI sincerely deplore his\u000a     tragical end--he was run over by a train of cars--yet (is it\u000a     wicked?
p4463
aV), my grief is mitigated by the thought that it removes all\u000a     obstacle to our union.
p4464
aVI do not for an instant charge you with\u000a     interested motives.
p4465
aVI am sure of your love, but I also comprehend\u000a     the necessities of your position.
p4466
aVYou have been brought up as a\u000a     gentleman, and you have the tastes of a gentleman.
p4467
aVYou cannot\u000a     surrender your social position.
p4468
aVIt is necessary that, if you\u000a     marry, you should have an adequate income to live upon.
p4469
aVMy darling\u000a     Gregory, I am proud and happy in the thought that I can make you\u000a     such.
p4470
aVYou know my estate.
p4471
aVThe rental is two thousand pounds, and\u000a     that is enough to maintain our social rank.
p4472
aVCome home, then, as\u000a     soon, as you receive this letter.
p4473
aVI am awaiting you impatiently,\u000a     and can hardly reconcile myself to the delay that must be.
p4474
aVMake it\u000a     as short as possible, and let me hear from you at once.
p4475
aV"Your own,\u000a     "JANE MIDDLETON."
p4476
aVThere was unexpected delay in the reception of this letter.
p4477
aVIt was\u000athree months before it came into the hands of Captain Lovell.
p4478
aVWhen at\u000alength it was received, he read it with a mixture of emotions.
p4479
aV"Decidedly," he said, removing the cigar from his mouth, "the old girl\u000ais fond of me.
p4480
aVI wish I were fond of her, for I suppose I must marry\u000aher.
p4481
aVIt will be rather a bad pill to swallow, but it is well gilded.
p4482
aVTwo thousand pounds a year are not to be thrown away by a fellow in my\u000astraits.
p4483
aVThe prospect might be brighter, but I suppose I have no right\u000ato complain.
p4484
aVIt will make me comfortable for life.
p4485
aVI must take care to\u000ahave the estate settled upon me, and then the sooner the old girl dies\u000athe better."
p4486
aVSo Captain Lovell wrote at once, saying that he would return home as\u000asoon as he could make arrangements for doing so--that every day would\u000aseem a month till he could once more embrace his dear Jane.
p4487
aVThe letter\u000awas signed, "Your devoted Gregory."
p4488
aVMrs. Middleton read it with unfeigned delight.
p4489
aVHer plans had succeeded,\u000aand the reward would soon be hers.
p4490
aVBut there was fresh delay.
p4491
aVArrangements to return could not be made so\u000aeasily as Captain Lovell anticipated.
p4492
aVIt was seven months from the day\u000aMrs. Middleton reached England when Captain Lovell was driven to his\u000ahotel in London.
p4493
aVMeanwhile events had occurred which were to have an\u000aeffect upon Mrs. Middleton's plans.
p4494
aVCHAPTER XXXIV.
p4495
aVTONY ASTONISHES HIS OLD FRIENDS.
p4496
aV"Tony," said George Spencer one evening, "you have been making\u000awonderful progress in your studies.
p4497
aVIn six months you have accomplished\u000aas much as I did at boarding school in two years when at your age."
p4498
aV"Do you really mean it, Mr.
p4499
aVSpencer?"
p4500
aVsaid Tony, gratified.
p4501
aV"I am quite in earnest."
p4502
aV"I am very glad of it," said Tony.
p4503
aV"When I began I was almost\u000adiscouraged.
p4504
aVI was so much behind boys of my age."
p4505
aV"And now your attainments raise you above the average.
p4506
aVYour tutor told\u000ame so yesterday when I made inquiries."
p4507
aV"I am rejoiced to hear it, Mr. Spencer, I was very much ashamed of\u000amyself at first, and I did not like to speak before your friends for\u000afear they would find out what sort of a life I led.
p4508
aVThat is what made\u000ame work so hard."
p4509
aV"Well, Tony, you may congratulate yourself on having succeeded.
p4510
aVI think\u000ayou can venture now to take a little vacation."
p4511
aV"A vacation!
p4512
aVI don't need one."
p4513
aV"Suppose it were spent in Europe?"
p4514
aV"What!"
p4515
aVexclaimed Tony, eagerly, "you don't think of our going abroad?"
p4516
aV"Yes.
p4517
aVThe house with which I am connected wants me to go abroad on\u000abusiness.
p4518
aVIf I go you may go with me if you would like it."
p4519
aV"Like it!"
p4520
aVexclaimed Tony, impetuously.
p4521
aV"There is nothing I would like\u000abetter."
p4522
aV"So I supposed," said George Spencer, smiling.
p4523
aV"I may as well tell you\u000athat our passage is taken for next Saturday, by the Russia."
p4524
aV"And this is Monday evening.
p4525
aVHow soon it seems!"
p4526
aV"There won't be much preparation to make--merely packing your trunk."
p4527
aV"Mr. Spencer," said Tony, "I want to ask a favor."
p4528
aV"What is it?"
p4529
aV"I have told you about being employed at a country hotel, just before I\u000acame to the city and found you."
p4530
aV"Yes."
p4531
aV"I would like to go back there for a day, just to see how all my old\u000afriends are."
p4532
aV"You don't mean to apply again for your old place?"
p4533
aV"Not unless you turn me off, and I have to find work somewhere."
p4534
aV"Turn you off, Tony!
p4535
aVWhy, I shouldn't know how to get along without\u000ayou.
p4536
aVYou are like a younger brother to me," said the young man,\u000aearnestly.
p4537
aV"Thank you, Mr. Spencer.
p4538
aVYou seem like an older brother to me.
p4539
aVSometimes I can hardly believe that I was once a tramp."
p4540
aV"It was your misfortune, Tony, not your fault.
p4541
aVSo you want to go back\u000aand view your former home?"
p4542
aV"Yes, Mr.
p4543
aVSpencer."
p4544
aV"Then you had better start to-morrow morning, so as to be back in good\u000atime to prepare for the journey."
p4545
aV"Do you know, Mr. Spencer," said Tony, "I've got an idea.
p4546
aVI'll go back\u000awearing the same clothes I had on when I left there."
p4547
aV"Have you got them still?"
p4548
aV"Yes, I laid them away, just to remind me of my old life.
p4549
aVI'll take my\u000aother clothes in a bundle, and after a while I can put them on."
p4550
aV"What is your idea in doing this, Tony?"
p4551
aVasked the young man.
p4552
aV"I want to give them a surprise."
p4553
aV"Very well, do as you please.
p4554
aVOnly don't stay away too long."
p4555
aV*       *       *       *       *       *\u000a\u000aTony proceeded to carry out the plan he had proposed.
p4556
aVHe traveled by rail to a village near by, and then with his bundle\u000asuspended to a stick, took up his march to the tavern.
p4557
aVHe entered the familiar stable yard.
p4558
aVAll looked as it did the day\u000ahe left.
p4559
aVThere was only one person in the yard, and that one Tony\u000arecognized at once as his old enemy, Sam Payson, who appeared to be\u000afilling his old position, as stable boy.
p4560
aV"Hallo, Sam!"
p4561
aVsaid Tony, whose entrance had not been observed.
p4562
aVSam looked up and whistled.
p4563
aV"What, have you come back?"
p4564
aVhe said, not appearing overjoyed at the\u000asight of Tony.
p4565
aV"Yes, Sam," said Tony.
p4566
aV"Where have you been all the time?"
p4567
aV"In New York part of the time."
p4568
aV"What have you been doing for a living?"
p4569
aV"Well, I lived with a gentleman there."
p4570
aV"What did you do--black his boots?"
p4571
aV"Not exactly."
p4572
aV"Did he turn you off?"
p4573
aV"No; but he's going to Europe next Saturday."
p4574
aV"So you're out of a place?"
p4575
aV"I have no employment."
p4576
aV"What made you come back here?"
p4577
aVdemanded Sam, suspiciously.
p4578
aV"I thought I'd like to see you all again."
p4579
aV"That don't go down," said Sam roughly.
p4580
aV"I know well enough what you're\u000aafter."
p4581
aV"What am I after?"
p4582
aV"You're after my place.
p4583
aVYou're hoping Mr. Porter will take you on\u000aagain.
p4584
aVBut it's no use.
p4585
aVThere ain't any chance for you."
p4586
aV"How long have you been back again, Sam?"
p4587
aV"Three months, and I am going to stay, too.
p4588
aVYou got me turned off once,\u000abut you can't do it again."
p4589
aV"I don't want to."
p4590
aV"Oh, no, I presume not," sneered Sam.
p4591
aV"Of course, you don't.
p4592
aVYou've got\u000aon the same clothes you wore away, haven't you?"
p4593
aV"Yes, it's the same suit, but I've got some more things in my bundle."
p4594
aV"I guess you haven't made your fortune, by the looks."
p4595
aV"The fact is, Sam, I haven't earned much since I went away."
p4596
aV"I knew you wouldn't.
p4597
aVYou ain't so smart as people think."
p4598
aV"I didn't know anybody thought me smart."
p4599
aV"James, the hostler, is always talking you up to me, but I guess I can\u000arub along as well as you."
p4600
aV"You talk as if I was your enemy, Sam, instead of your friend."
p4601
aV"I don't want such a friend.
p4602
aVYou're after my place, in spite of all you\u000asay."
p4603
aVJust then James, the hostler, came out of the stable.
p4604
aV"What, is it you, Tony?"
p4605
aVhe asked, cordially.
p4606
aV"Yes, James; I hope you're well."
p4607
aV"Tip-top; and how are you?"
p4608
aVasked the hostler, examining Tony,\u000acritically.
p4609
aV"I'm well."
p4610
aV"Have you been doing well?"
p4611
aV"I haven't wanted for anything.
p4612
aVI've been with a gentleman in New York."
p4613
aVHere Mr. Porter appeared on the scene.
p4614
aVHe too, recognized Tony.
p4615
aV"What!
p4616
aVback again, Tony?"
p4617
aVhe said.
p4618
aV"I thought I'd just look in, sir."
p4619
aV"Do you want a place!"
p4620
aV"What sort of a place?"
p4621
aV"Your old place."
p4622
aVSam heard this, and looked the picture of dismay.
p4623
aVHe took it for\u000agranted that Tony would accept at once, and privately determined that\u000aif he did he would give him a flogging, if it were a possible thing.
p4624
aVHe was both relieved and surprised when Tony answered:\u000a\u000a"I am much obliged to you, Mr. Porter, but I wouldn't like to cut out\u000aSam.
p4625
aVBesides, I have a place engaged in New York."
p4626
aV"I would rather have you than Sam, any day."
p4627
aV"Thank you, sir, but I've made an arrangement, and can't break it."
p4628
aV"How long are you going to stay here?"
p4629
aV"If you've a spare room, I'll stay over till to-morrow."
p4630
aV"All right.
p4631
aVGo into the office, and they'll give you one."
p4632
aV"I say, Tony," said Sam, after the landlord had gone, "you're a better\u000afellow than I thought you were.
p4633
aVI thought you'd take my place when it\u000awas offered you."
p4634
aV"You see you were mistaken, Sam.
p4635
aVI'll see you again."
p4636
aVTony went into the hotel--went up to a small chamber that had been\u000aassigned him, changed his clothes for a handsome suit in his bundle,\u000atook a handsome gold watch and chain from his pocket and displayed\u000athem on his vest, and then came down again.
p4637
aVAs he entered the yard again, Sam stared in amazement.
p4638
aV"It can't be you, Tony!"
p4639
aVhe said.
p4640
aV"Where'd you get them clothes, and\u000athat watch?"
p4641
aV"I came by them honestly, Sam."
p4642
aV"But I can't understand it," said Sam, scratching his head.
p4643
aV"Ain't you\u000apoor, and out of work?"
p4644
aV"I'm out of work, but not poor.
p4645
aVI've been adopted by a rich gentleman,\u000aand am going to sail for Europe on Saturday."
p4646
aV"Cracky!
p4647
aVwho ever heard the like?
p4648
aVWouldn't he adopt me, too?"
p4649
aV"I believe there is no vacancy," said Tony, smiling.
p4650
aV"Was that the reason you wouldn't take my place?"
p4651
aV"One reason."
p4652
aV"James!"
p4653
aVcalled Sam, "just look at Tony now."
p4654
aVJames stared, and when an explanation was made, heartily congratulated\u000aour hero.
p4655
aV"Sam," said Tony, producing a couple of showy neck-ties, "to prove to\u000ayou that I am not your enemy, I have brought you these."
p4656
aV"They're stunning!"
p4657
aVexclaimed the enraptured Sam.
p4658
aV"I always thought you\u000awas a good fellow, Tony.
p4659
aVAre they really for me?"
p4660
aV"To be sure they are, but I'm afraid, Sam, you didn't always think\u000aquite so well of me."
p4661
aV"Well, I do now.
p4662
aVYou're a trump."
p4663
aV"And, James, I've brought you a present too."
p4664
aVHere Tony produced a\u000ahandsome silver watch with a silver chain appended.
p4665
aV"It's to remember\u000ame by."
p4666
aV"I'd remember you without it, Tony, but I'm very much obliged too.
p4667
aVIt's\u000aa real beauty."
p4668
aVWhen the landlord was told of Tony's good fortune, he was as much\u000asurprised as the rest.
p4669
aVOur hero was at once changed to the handsomest\u000aroom in the hotel, and was made quite a lion during the remainder of\u000ahis stay.
p4670
aVThere is something in success after all.
p4671
aV"Good-by, Tony," said Sam heartily, when our hero left the next day.
p4672
aV"You're a gentleman, and I always said so."
p4673
aV"Thank you, Sam.
p4674
aVGood luck to you!"
p4675
aVresponded Tony, smiling.
p4676
aV"I'm a much finer fellow than when I was a tramp," he said to himself.
p4677
aV"Sam says so, and he ought to know.
p4678
aVI suppose it's the way of the\u000aworld.
p4679
aVAnd now for Europe!"
p4680
aVCHAPTER XXXV.
p4681
aVTONY'S BAD LUCK.
p4682
aVTwo weeks later Tony and his friend were guests at a popular London\u000ahotel, not far from Charing Cross.
p4683
aV"We will postpone business till we have seen a little of London," said\u000aGeorge Spencer.
p4684
aV"Luckily my business is not of a pressing character,\u000aand it can wait."
p4685
aV"You have been in London before, Mr. Spencer," said Tony.
p4686
aV"I am afraid\u000ayou will find it a bore going round with me."
p4687
aV"Not at all.
p4688
aVI spent a week here when a boy of twelve, and saw nothing\u000athoroughly, so I am at your disposal.
p4689
aVWhere shall we go first?"
p4690
aV"I should like to see Buckingham Palace, where the queen lives."
p4691
aV"She doesn't live there much.
p4692
aVHowever, we'll go to see it, but we'll\u000atake the Parliament House and Westminster Abbey on the way."
p4693
aVIn accordance with this programme they walked--for the distance was\u000abut short--to Westminster Abbey.
p4694
aVIt would be out of place for me to\u000adescribe here that wonderful church where so much of the rank and\u000atalent of past ages lies buried.
p4695
aVIt is enough to say that Tony enjoyed\u000ait highly.
p4696
aVHe afterward visited the Parliament House.
p4697
aVThis occupied\u000aanother hour.
p4698
aVWhen they came out Mr. Spencer said:\u000a\u000a"Tony, I have got to go to my banker's.
p4699
aVDo you care to come?"
p4700
aV"No, thank you, Mr. Spencer, I would rather walk round by myself."
p4701
aV"Very well, Tony, just as you please.
p4702
aVOnly don't get lost."
p4703
aV"I'll take care of that; I'm used to cities."
p4704
aV"You are not used to London.
p4705
aVIt is one of the blindest cities in the\u000aworld; it is a complete labyrinth."
p4706
aV"I don't mean to get lost.
p4707
aVYou'll find me at the hotel at four o'clock."
p4708
aV"Very well.
p4709
aVThat will be early enough."
p4710
aVSo George Spencer went his way, and Tony set out upon his rambles.
p4711
aVHe found plenty to amuse him in the various buildings and sights of the\u000agreat metropolis.
p4712
aVBut after awhile he began to wonder where he was.
p4713
aVHe\u000ahad strayed into a narrow street, scarcely more than a lane, with a row\u000aof tumble-down dwellings on either side.
p4714
aV"There's nothing worth seeing here," said our hero.
p4715
aV"I'll inquire my\u000away to Charing Cross."
p4716
aVHe went into a small beer house, and preferred his request.
p4717
aV"Charing Cross!"
p4718
aVrepeated the publican.
p4719
aV"It's a good ways from 'ere."
p4720
aV"How far?"
p4721
aVasked Tony.
p4722
aV"A mile easy, and there's no end of turns."
p4723
aV"Just start me, then," said Tony, "and I'll reach there.
p4724
aVWhich way is\u000ait?"
p4725
aV"Turn to the left when you go out of this shop."
p4726
aV"All right, and thank you."
p4727
aVTony noticed that there were three or four men seated at tables in\u000athe back part of the shop, but he had not the curiosity to look at\u000athem.
p4728
aVIf he had, he would have been startled, for among these men was\u000aRudolph Rugg, more disreputable than ever in appearance, for he had\u000abeen drinking deeply for the last six months.
p4729
aVHe stared at Tony as one\u000adazed, for he supposed him dead long ago at the bottom of a well three\u000athousand miles away.
p4730
aV"What's the matter, Rugg?"
p4731
aVasked his companion.
p4732
aV"You look as if you'd\u000aseen a ghost."
p4733
aV"So I have," muttered Rugg, starting for the door.
p4734
aV"Where are you going?"
p4735
aV"I've got a headache," said Rudolph.
p4736
aV"You've left your drink."
p4737
aV"I don't want it."
p4738
aV"What's come over him?"
p4739
aVsaid his late companion, in surprise.
p4740
aV"No matter.
p4741
aVHe'll be back soon."
p4742
aVRudolph swiftly followed Tony.
p4743
aVHe wanted to find out whether it was\u000areally the boy whom he had sought to murder or not.
p4744
aVThen what did his\u000aappearance in London mean?
p4745
aVWas he possibly in search of him--Rugg?
p4746
aVIt\u000awas wonderful, certainly.
p4747
aVHow had he obtained the means of coming to\u000aEngland?--as a gentleman, too, for Rudolph had not failed to notice\u000ahis rich clothes.
p4748
aVHad he obtained rich and powerful friends, and was he\u000ain search of the inheritance that had been wrongfully kept from him?
p4749
aVRudolph asked himself all these questions, but he could not answer one.
p4750
aV"If I could only ask him," he thought, "but that wouldn't be safe."
p4751
aVBy this time he had come in sight of Tony, who was walking along\u000aslowly, not feeling in any particular hurry.
p4752
aVAn idea struck Rudolph.
p4753
aVA boy who had been employed in begging was standing on the sidewalk.
p4754
aV"Gi'me a penny, sir," he said.
p4755
aVRudolph paused.
p4756
aV"Walk along with me, and I'll show you how you can earn half a crown,"\u000ahe said.
p4757
aV"Will you?"
p4758
aVsaid the boy, his face brightening.
p4759
aV"Yes, I will, and you won't find it hard work, either."
p4760
aV"Go ahead, gov'nor."
p4761
aV"Do you see that boy ahead?"
p4762
aV"That young gentleman?"
p4763
aV"Yes," said Rudolph.
p4764
aV"I see him."
p4765
aV"I want you to manage to get him up to my room; it's No.
p4766
aV7 ---- street,\u000atop floor, just at the head of the stairs."
p4767
aV"Shall I tell him you want to see him?"
p4768
aV"No, he wouldn't come.
p4769
aVTell him your poor grandfather is sick in\u000abed--anything you like, only get him to come."
p4770
aV"S'posin' he won't come?"
p4771
aV"Then follow him, and find out where he is staying.
p4772
aVDo you understand?"
p4773
aV"Yes, gov'nor.
p4774
aVI'll bring him."
p4775
aV"Go ahead, and I'll hurry round to the room.
p4776
aVI'll be in bed."
p4777
aV"All right."
p4778
aVThe boy was a sharp specimen of the juvenile London beggar.
p4779
aVHe was up\u000ato the usual tricks of his class, and quite competent to the task which\u000aRudolph had engaged him to perform.
p4780
aVHe came up to Tony, and then began to whimper.
p4781
aV"What's the matter, Johnny?"
p4782
aVsaid Tony, addressing him by the usual New\u000aYork name for an unknown boy.
p4783
aV"Oh, my poor grandfather is so sick," said the boy.
p4784
aV"What's the matter with him?"
p4785
aV"I don't know.
p4786
aVI guess he's goin' to die."
p4787
aV"Why don't you send for a doctor?"
p4788
aV"He wouldn't come--we're so poor."
p4789
aV"Do you live near here?"
p4790
aV"Oh, yes, sir; only a little way."
p4791
aV"I want to go to Charing Cross--is it much out of the way?"
p4792
aV"No, sir; it's right on the way there."
p4793
aV"Then, if you'll show me the way to Charing Cross afterward, I will\u000ago round with you and look at your grandfather.
p4794
aVPerhaps I can do\u000asomething for him."
p4795
aV"Oh, sir, how kind you are!
p4796
aVI know'd you was a gentleman when I fust\u000asaw you."
p4797
aV"When was your grandfather taken sick?"
p4798
aV"Two days ago," said the boy.
p4799
aV"Is he in bed?"
p4800
aV"Yes, sir.
p4801
aVLeastways, he was when I came out.
p4802
aVWe didn't have no\u000abreakfast."
p4803
aV"I am sorry for that.
p4804
aVDon't you want to buy something to take to him?"
p4805
aV"If you'll give me a shillin', sir, I'll ask him what he can eat.
p4806
aVSick\u000afolks can't eat the same things as the rest of us."
p4807
aV"To be sure.
p4808
aVYou are right.
p4809
aVWell, here's a shilling."
p4810
aV"The boy little thinks that I have known many a time what it is to\u000abe without breakfast or money to buy any," thought Tony.
p4811
aV"I'll do\u000asomething for the poor man, if only to show how grateful I am for my\u000aown good fortune."
p4812
aVHe followed the boy for about ten minutes, until they reached rather a\u000ashabby building.
p4813
aVThis was No.
p4814
aV7.
p4815
aV"Come right up after me," said the boy.
p4816
aVThe two went up till they reached the room indicated by Rudolph.
p4817
aVThe\u000aboy pushed the door open.
p4818
aVA sound of groaning proceeded from the bed.
p4819
aV"Grandfather, I've brought a kind young gentleman," said the boy.
p4820
aV"Come here," muttered the person in bed.
p4821
aVTony came up to the bed.
p4822
aVIn an instant Rudolph had thrown off the clothes and had him seized by\u000athe arm.
p4823
aV"There's your money, boy.
p4824
aVGo!"
p4825
aVhe said to the other, flinging a\u000ahalf-crown.
p4826
aV"I've got you at last!"
p4827
aVhe shouted.
p4828
aV"Now, you young villain, I'll get\u000aeven with you!"
p4829
aVHis face was almost fiendish with rage, as he uttered these words.
p4830
aVCHAPTER XXXVI.
p4831
aV"I HATE YOU!"
p4832
aVTo say that Tony was not startled would not be true.
p4833
aVWithout a moment's\u000awarning he found himself in the power of his old enemy--completely in\u000ahis power, knowing, too, the desperate character of the man, which\u000awould let him stick at nothing.
p4834
aVRudolph enjoyed his evident surprise.
p4835
aV"I've been waiting for this," he said.
p4836
aV"It's a great joy to me to have\u000ayou here in my power."
p4837
aVBy this time Tony had collected himself, and had become composed.
p4838
aV"Rudolph," he said, "what makes you hate me so?"
p4839
aV"Haven't you tried to injure me--didn't you get me arrested?
p4840
aVDo you\u000aforget that night in the old miser's hut?"
p4841
aV"No, I don't forget it, but you forced me to act as I did.
p4842
aVBut even if\u000aI did injure you, you took your revenge."
p4843
aV"When, and how?"
p4844
aV"When you threw me into the well.
p4845
aVHow could you do such a dark deed?
p4846
aVWhat had I done that you should seek to murder me?"
p4847
aV"How did you get out?"
p4848
aVasked Rudolph, giving way to curiosity.
p4849
aV"I climbed out."
p4850
aV"How?"
p4851
aV"By means of the wall that lined the well.
p4852
aVFinally I got hold of the\u000arope."
p4853
aV"So that was the way, was it?
p4854
aVI ought to have made surer of your fate."
p4855
aV"How could you do that?"
p4856
aV"By throwing some rocks down on you," answered the tramp, with a\u000amalignant frown.
p4857
aV"I am glad I have not such a wicked disposition as you, Rudolph," said\u000aTony, looking at him fixedly.
p4858
aV"Take care how you insult me, boy!"
p4859
aVsaid Rudolph, angrily.
p4860
aV"I have no wish to insult you.
p4861
aVNow tell me why you have lured me here?
p4862
aVI suppose you hired the boy."
p4863
aV"I did, and he did the work well," said the tramp, triumphantly.
p4864
aV"Well, now I am here, what do you want of me?"
p4865
aV"First, tell me how you happen to be in London?
p4866
aVDid you know I was\u000ahere?"
p4867
aV"I knew you crossed the Atlantic."
p4868
aV"How?"
p4869
aV"I saw you buy your ticket."
p4870
aV"What?"
p4871
aVexclaimed the tramp, in surprise.
p4872
aV"Did you reach New York so\u000asoon?"
p4873
aV"Yes.
p4874
aVI lost my situation at the inn, for they did not believe my story\u000aabout having been thrown down the well by a Quaker."
p4875
aVRudolph laughed.
p4876
aV"It was a good disguise," he said.
p4877
aV"So they discharged you?
p4878
aVThat was\u000agood."
p4879
aV"I did not think so at the time, but it proved to be the luckiest thing\u000athat could happen to me."
p4880
aV"How was that?"
p4881
aV"It led me to go to New York.
p4882
aVThere I found a rich and generous friend.
p4883
aVI have been with him ever since."
p4884
aV"As a servant?"
p4885
aV"No; as his adopted brother.
p4886
aVHe supplied me with teachers, and in\u000alittle more than six months I have acquired as much as most boys do in\u000atwo or three years."
p4887
aV"So you have gone in for education, have you?"
p4888
aVsaid Rudolph, sneering.
p4889
aV"Yes.
p4890
aVCould I go in for anything better?"
p4891
aV"And you consider yourself a young gentleman, now, do you?"
p4892
aV"That is the rank I hold in society," said Tony, calmly.
p4893
aV"And you forget that you were once Tony, the Tramp?"
p4894
aV"No, Rudolph, I have not forgotten that.
p4895
aVIt was not my fault, and I am\u000anot ashamed of it.
p4896
aVBut I should be ashamed if I had not left that kind\u000aof life as soon as I was able."
p4897
aV"By Heaven, you shall go back to it!"
p4898
aVsaid Rudolph, malignantly.
p4899
aV"I never will," answered Tony, gently, but firmly.
p4900
aV"I will force you to it."
p4901
aV"Neither you nor any one else can force me to it.
p4902
aVI will black boots in\u000athe street first."
p4903
aV"That will suit me just as well," said the tramp, laughing maliciously.
p4904
aV"You have grown too proud.
p4905
aVI want to lower your pride, young popinjay."
p4906
aV"I am not afraid of anything you can do to me, Rudolph," said Tony,\u000abravely.
p4907
aV"Suppose I choose to kill you?"
p4908
aV"You won't dare do it.
p4909
aVWe are not in the woods now."
p4910
aVTony had hit the truth.
p4911
aVRudolph did not dare to kill him, though he\u000awould have been glad to.
p4912
aVBut he knew that he would himself be arrested,\u000aand he had more to live for now than formerly.
p4913
aVHe had an income,\u000aand comfortably provided for, and he did not choose to give up this\u000acomfortable and independent life.
p4914
aV"No," he said, "I won't kill you; but I will be revenged for all that.
p4915
aVFirst, I will keep you from that generous friend of yours."
p4916
aV"What will he think has become of me?"
p4917
aVthought Tony, uneasily.
p4918
aVA thought came to him.
p4919
aVHe would appeal to the man's love of money.
p4920
aV"Rudolph," he said, "I am afraid my friend will be uneasy about me.
p4921
aVIf\u000ayou will let me go I will give you ten pounds that I have in my pocket."
p4922
aV"I don't believe you have so much money," said Rudolph, cunningly.
p4923
aVTony fell into the snare unsuspectingly.
p4924
aVHe drew out his pocket-book\u000aand displayed two five-pound notes on the Bank of England.
p4925
aVRudolph quickly snatched them from him.
p4926
aV"They are mine already," he said, with a mocking laugh.
p4927
aV"So I see," said Tony, coolly; "but I was about to offer you fifty\u000apounds besides."
p4928
aV"Have you the money in your pocketbook?"
p4929
aV"No, I haven't, but I could get it from Mr.
p4930
aVSpencer."
p4931
aV"It don't go down, Tony," said Rudolph, shaking his head.
p4932
aV"I am not so\u000amuch in need of money as to pay so dearly for it.
p4933
aVListen to me.
p4934
aVIf you\u000ahave been lucky, so have I. I have an income, safe and sure, of one\u000ahundred and fifty pounds."
p4935
aV"You have!"
p4936
aVexclaimed Tony, surprised.
p4937
aV"Yes."
p4938
aV"Do you hold any position?"
p4939
aV"No; I merely promise to keep my mouth shut."
p4940
aV"Is it about me?"
p4941
aV"Yes.
p4942
aVThe long and short of it is that there is an English estate,\u000abringing in two thousand pounds rental, that of right belongs to you."
p4943
aV"To me--an estate of two thousand pounds a year?"
p4944
aVexclaimed Tony, in\u000aastonishment.
p4945
aV"Yes; the party who owns it pays me an income as hush money.
p4946
aVI have\u000aonly to say the word, and the estate will be yours, Tony."
p4947
aV"Say the word, Rudolph, and you shall have the same income," entreated\u000aTony.
p4948
aV"It isn't the money I so much care for, but I want to know who\u000aI am.
p4949
aVI want to be restored to my rightful place in society.
p4950
aVIs my\u000amother living?"
p4951
aV"No."
p4952
aV"Nor my father?"
p4953
aV"No."
p4954
aVTony looked sober.
p4955
aV"Then I should not care so much for the money.
p4956
aVStill it ought to be\u000amine."
p4957
aV"Of course it ought," said Rudolph, gloating over the boy's emotion.
p4958
aV"You shall lose nothing by telling me--by becoming my friend.
p4959
aVI will\u000anever refer to the past--never speak of what happened in America."
p4960
aV"No doubt," sneered Rudolph, "but it can't be."
p4961
aV"Why can't it be?"
p4962
aV"_Because I hate you!_" hissed the tramp, with a baleful look.
p4963
aV"Not\u000aanother word.
p4964
aVIt's no use, I shall lock you up here for the present,\u000awhile I am out.
p4965
aVWhen I come back I will let you know what I am going to\u000ado to you."
p4966
aVHe left the room, locking the door behind him.
p4967
aVTony sat down to reflect upon the strange position in which he was\u000aplaced.
p4968
aVCHAPTER XXXVII.
p4969
aVMRS. MIDDLETON AND HER LOVER.
p4970
aVWhen Rudolph left Tony imprisoned, he began to think over the situation\u000awith regard to his own interest.
p4971
aVHe was already dissatisfied with the income he received from Mrs.\u000aMiddleton; though at the time it seemed to him large, he found that he\u000acould easily spend more.
p4972
aVHe did not have expensive lodgings--in fact,\u000athey were plain, and quite within his means, but he drank and gambled,\u000aand both these amusements were expensive.
p4973
aVHe had already made up his\u000amind to ask for a larger income, and Tony's offer stimulated him to ask\u000aat once.
p4974
aV"If Mrs. Middleton won't, the boy will," he said to himself.
p4975
aVMrs. Middleton was in London.
p4976
aVIn fact, at that moment she was\u000aconversing with Captain Lovell, to whom she had been formally\u000abetrothed.
p4977
aVHe had satisfied himself that the prospects were all right,\u000aand then had renewed his offer.
p4978
aVThe marriage was to take place in a\u000amonth, and Mrs. Middleton was in town to make suitable preparations for\u000ait.
p4979
aVShe was perfectly happy, for she was about to marry a man she loved.
p4980
aVAs for Captain Lovell, he was well enough contented.
p4981
aVHe did not care\u000amuch for the lady as regards love, but he was decidedly in love with\u000aher property.
p4982
aV"It will make me comfortable for life," he said, with a shrug of the\u000ashoulders, "and after marriage I can pay as little attention to Mrs.\u000aLovell as I choose.
p4983
aVShe must be content with marrying my name."
p4984
aVThe widow had taken handsome apartments at a West End boarding house.
p4985
aVThere she received callers.
p4986
aVCaptain Lovell was lounging in an easy chair, looking rather bored.

aVHis\u000a_fiancee_ was inspecting an array of dry goods which had been sent in\u000afrom a fancy London shop.
p4988
aV"Don't you think this silk elegant, Gregory!"
p4989
aVshe asked, displaying a\u000apattern.
p4990
aV"Oh, ah, yes, I suppose so," he answered with a yawn.
p4991
aV"I would like to have your taste, Gregory."
p4992
aV"I have no taste, my dear Mrs. Middleton, about such matters."
p4993
aV"Don't you think it will become me?"
p4994
aV"Why, to be sure; everything becomes you, you know."
p4995
aVShe laughed.
p4996
aV"Would a yellow turban become me?"
p4997
aVshe asked.
p4998
aV"Well, perhaps not," he said, "but of course you know best."
p4999
aV"How little you men know about a lady's dress!"
p5000
aV"I should think so.
p5001
aVThe fact is, my dear Mrs. Middleton, that part of\u000amy education was neglected."
p5002
aV"When I am your wife, Gregory, I shall always appeal to your taste."
p5003
aV"Will you?"
p5004
aVhe said, rather frightened.
p5005
aV"'Pon my honor, I hope you\u000awon't now."
p5006
aV"And I shall expect you to consult me about your wardrobe."
p5007
aV"What, about my trousers and coats?
p5008
aVReally, that's very amusing; 'pon\u000amy honor it is."
p5009
aV"Don't you think I feel an interest in how my dear Gregory is dressed?"
p5010
aV"I don't know, I'm sure."
p5011
aV"But I do, and shall I tell you why?"
p5012
aV"If you want to."
p5013
aV"Because I love you," she said softly, and she rose from her chair, and\u000acrossing, laid her hand affectionately on his shoulder.
p5014
aVHe shrank, just the least in the world, and felt annoyed, but didn't\u000alike to say so.
p5015
aVShe might be angry, and though he did not love her, he\u000adid want to marry her, and so escape from his money troubles.
p5016
aV"Of course, I'm ever so much obliged to you," he said, "and all that\u000asort of thing."
p5017
aV"And you love me, Gregory, don't you?"
p5018
aVshe asked, tenderly.
p5019
aV"Did you ever!
p5020
aVI wish she'd stop," he said to himself.
p5021
aV"She makes me\u000aawful uncomfortable."
p5022
aV"Don't you love me, Gregory?"
p5023
aV"If I didn't love you, do you think I would have asked you to become\u000aMrs.
p5024
aVLovell?"
p5025
aVhe said, evading the question.
p5026
aV"To be sure, Gregory," she replied, trying to look satisfied.
p5027
aV"And now I must go; I must, 'pon my honor," he said, rising.
p5028
aV"You have been here so short a time," she pleaded.
p5029
aV"But I promised to be at the club.
p5030
aVI'm to meet a fellow officer, and\u000ait's the hour now."
p5031
aV"Then I must let you go.
p5032
aVBut you'll come again soon?"
p5033
aV"Yes, 'pon honor," and the captain kissed his hand to his _fiancee_.
p5034
aV"I wonder if he really loves me!"
p5035
aVshe said to herself, wistfully.
p5036
aVAt this moment the servant entered.
p5037
aV"Please, ma'am, there's a rough-looking man below, who says he wants to\u000asee you.
p5038
aVHis name is Rugg."
p5039
aV"Admit him," said Mrs. Middleton, looking annoyed.

p5041
aVA STORMY INTERVIEW.
p5042
aV"Why are you here Mr.
p5043
aVRugg?"
p5044
aVdemanded Mrs. Middleton, coolly.
p5045
aV"On business," said the tramp, throwing himself, uninvited upon the\u000asame chair from which Captain Lovell had just risen.
p5046
aVMrs. Middleton flushed with anger, but she did not dare to treat his\u000ainsolence as it deserved.
p5047
aV"What business can you have with me?"
p5048
aVshe asked, coldly.
p5049
aV"It's about the allowance."
p5050
aV"It was paid punctually, was it not?"
p5051
aV"Yes."
p5052
aV"Then you can have no business with me.
p5053
aVHave I not told you that you\u000aare not to call upon me at any time?
p5054
aVMy agent attends to that."
p5055
aV"I want the allowance raised," said Rudolph, abruptly.
p5056
aV"Raised?"
p5057
aV"Yes, you must double it."
p5058
aVMrs. Middleton was now really angry.
p5059
aV"I never heard such insolence," she said.
p5060
aV"You have taken your trouble\u000afor nothing.
p5061
aVI shall not give you a pound more."
p5062
aV"You'd better, Mrs. Middleton," said Rudolph, "or I may tell all I\u000aknow."
p5063
aV"You would only ruin yourself, and lose your entire income."
p5064
aV"I should ruin you, too."
p5065
aV"Not at all.
p5066
aVNo one would believe you against me.
p5067
aVBesides, are you\u000aready to be tried for murder?"
p5068
aV"Who has committed murder?"
p5069
aV"You have."
p5070
aV"Prove it."
p5071
aV"Didn't you kill the boy?"
p5072
aV"No."
p5073
aV"You swore to me he was dead."
p5074
aV"Suppose he didn't die."
p5075
aV"You are wasting your time, Mr. Rugg," said Mrs. Middleton, coldly.
p5076
aV"Of\u000acourse I understand your motives.
p5077
aVYou have been extravagant, and wasted\u000ayour money, hoping to get more out of me.
p5078
aVBut it is useless."
p5079
aV"You'll be sorry for this, ma'am," said Rugg, angrily.
p5080
aV"I don't think I shall.
p5081
aVBefore doing anything that _you_ will be sorry\u000afor, consider that to a man in your position the income I give you is\u000avery liberal."
p5082
aV"Liberal!
p5083
aVIt isn't one-tenth of what you get."
p5084
aV"Very true, but the case is different."
p5085
aV"You may believe me or not, but the boy is alive, and I know where he\u000ais."
p5086
aVMrs. Middleton did not believe one word of what he said.
p5087
aVShe was\u000aconvinced that Tony had been killed by the man before her, and was\u000aindignant at the trick which she thought he was trying to play upon\u000aher.
p5088
aVShe felt that if she yielded to his importunity, it would only be\u000athe beginning of a series of demands.
p5089
aVShe had courage and firmness, and\u000ashe decided to discourage him once for all in his exactions.
p5090
aV"I don't believe you," she said, "and I am not afraid."
p5091
aV"Then you won't increase my income," he said.
p5092
aV"No, I will not.
p5093
aVNeither now nor at any other time will I do it.
p5094
aVWhat I\u000ahave agreed to do I will do, but I will not give you a penny more.
p5095
aVDo\u000ayou understand me, Mr.
p5096
aVRugg?"
p5097
aV"I believe I do," said Rudolph, rising, "and I tell you you'll be sorry\u000afor what you are saying."
p5098
aV"I will take the risk," she said, contemptuously.
p5099
aVRudolph's face was distorted with passion as he left the room.
p5100
aV"I hate her more than the boy," he muttered.
p5101
aV"He shall have the estate."
p5102
aVCHAPTER XXXIX.
p5103
aVTONY'S ESCAPE.
p5104
aVWhen Tony found himself left a prisoner in his enemy's room, he did\u000anot immediately make an effort to escape, in fact, he did not feel\u000aparticularly alarmed.
p5105
aV"I am in a large city, and there are other lodgers in this building.
p5106
aVThere can be no danger.
p5107
aVI will wait awhile and think over what Rudolph\u000ahas told me.
p5108
aVCan it be true that I am heir to a large estate in\u000aEngland, and that he can restore me to it if he will?
p5109
aVHe can have no\u000amotive for deceiving me.
p5110
aVIt must be true."
p5111
aVTony felt that he would give a great deal to know more.
p5112
aVWhere was this\u000aestate, and who now held it?
p5113
aVIt occurred to him that some where about\u000athe room he might find some clew to the mystery.
p5114
aVHe immediately began\u000ato explore it.
p5115
aVRudolph was not a literary man.
p5116
aVHe had neither books nor papers whose\u000atell-tale testimony might convict him.
p5117
aVIn fact, the best of his\u000apersonal possessions was very small.
p5118
aVA few clothes were lying about\u000athe room.
p5119
aVTony decided to examine the pockets of these, in the hope of\u000adiscovering something in his interest.
p5120
aVFinally, he found in the pocket\u000aof a shooting coat a small memorandum book, in which a few entries,\u000achiefly of bets, had been made.
p5121
aVIn these Tony felt no interest, and he\u000awas about to throw down the book, when his eye caught this entry:\u000a\u000a"Dead broke.
p5122
aVMust write to Mrs. Middleton for more money."
p5123
aVTony's heart beat rapidly.
p5124
aVThis must be the person from whom Rudolph received his income, and, by\u000aconsequence the person who was in fraudulent possession of the estate\u000athat was rightfully his.
p5125
aV"Mrs.
p5126
aVMiddleton!"
p5127
aV"I wish I knew where she lives," thought our hero.
p5128
aV"No doubt there are\u000ahundreds of the name in England."
p5129
aVThis might be, but probably there was but one Mrs. Middleton in the\u000apossession of an estate worth two thousand pounds rental.
p5130
aV"I am on the track," thought Tony.
p5131
aV"Now let me get away, and consult\u000aGeorge Spencer."
p5132
aVIt was easier said than done.
p5133
aVThe door was locked, and it was too\u000astrong to break down.
p5134
aV"There must be somebody in the room below," thought Tony.
p5135
aV"I'll pound\u000atill they hear me."
p5136
aVHe jumped up and down with such force that it did attract attention in\u000athe room below.
p5137
aVPresently he heard a querulous voice at the key-hole:\u000a\u000a"What's the matter?
p5138
aVAre you mad?"
p5139
aV"No, but I'm locked in," said Tony.
p5140
aV"Can't you let me out?"
p5141
aV"I have no key to the door, but the landlady has."
p5142
aV"Won't you please to ask her to let me out?
p5143
aVI'll be ever so much\u000aobliged."
p5144
aV"Stop pounding then."
p5145
aV"I will."
p5146
aVScarcely two minutes had elapsed when a key was heard in the lock and\u000athe door was opened.
p5147
aV"How came you here, sir?"
p5148
aVasked the landlady, a short, stout\u000awoman--suspiciously.
p5149
aV"The gentleman locked me in--in a joke," said Tony.
p5150
aV"Maybe you're a burglar," said the landlady, eyeing him doubtfully.
p5151
aVTony laughed.
p5152
aV"Do I look like it?"
p5153
aVhe asked.
p5154
aV"Well, no," the landlady admitted, "but appearances are deceitful."
p5155
aV"Not with me, I assure you.
p5156
aVI am really sorry to put you to so much\u000atrouble to let me out.
p5157
aVWon't you accept of this?"
p5158
aVand Tony produced a\u000ahalf sovereign.
p5159
aV"Really, sir, I see that you are quite the gentleman," said the\u000alandlady, pocketing the piece with avidity.
p5160
aV"Can't I do anything for\u000ayou?"
p5161
aV"Only, if you'll be kind enough to give this to the gentleman when he\u000areturns."
p5162
aVTony hastily wrote a line on a card, and gave it to the now complacent\u000adame.
p5163
aVFifteen minutes after Tony's departure Rudolph returned.
p5164
aVHe sprang up stairs only to find the room empty and the bird flown.
p5165
aV"What's come of the boy!"
p5166
aVhe exclaimed in dismay; "how did he get out?"
p5167
aVHe summoned the landlady quickly.
p5168
aV"Do you know anything of the boy that was in my room, Mrs.
p5169
aVJones?"
p5170
aV"Yes, Mr. Rugg, I let him out.
p5171
aVHe said you locked him in in fun."
p5172
aV"Humph!
p5173
aVwhat else did he say?"
p5174
aV"He left this card for you."
p5175
aVRugg seized it hastily, and read with startled eyes:\u000a\u000a\u000a     "I am at Morley's.
p5176
aVCome and see me soon, or I will go to Mrs.\u000a     Middleton.
p5177
aV"TONY."
p5178
aV"Confusion?
p5179
aVwhere did the boy find out?"
p5180
aVthought the tramp.
p5181
aV"I must do\u000asomething, or I am ruined."
p5182
aVIt was a mystery to him how Tony had learned so much, and he naturally\u000aconcluded that he knew a good deal more.
p5183
aVHe felt that no time was to be\u000alost, and started at once for Morley's.
p5184
aVInquiring for Tony, he was at\u000aonce admitted to the presence of Tony and George Spencer.
p5185
aV"So you got my card!"
p5186
aVsaid Tony.
p5187
aV"Yes.
p5188
aVWhat do you know about Mrs.
p5189
aVMiddleton?"
p5190
aVdemanded Rudolph.
p5191
aV"That she possesses the estate that ought to be mine.
p5192
aVThat's about it,\u000aisn't it?"
p5193
aV"Yes," said Rudolph, "but you can't get it without me."
p5194
aV"Why not?"
p5195
aV"I was the man that was hired to abduct you when you was a boy."
p5196
aV"Can you prove that?"
p5197
aVasked Spencer.
p5198
aV"I can."
p5199
aV"Will your story be believed?"
p5200
aV"Yes.
p5201
aVThe tenantry will remember me.
p5202
aVI was one of them at the time."
p5203
aV"Are you ready to help my young friend here to recover his rights?"
p5204
aVasked Spencer.
p5205
aV"This morning I said no.
p5206
aVNow I say yes, if he'll do the fair thing by\u000ame."
p5207
aVA conference was entered into and a bargain was finally made.
p5208
aVRudolph\u000awas to receive two hundred pounds a year as a reward for his services,\u000aif successful.
p5209
aVWhen this arrangement had been completed, an appointment was made for\u000athe next morning; at which hour a lawyer of repute was also present.
p5210
aVAfter listening attentively to Rudolph's statement, he said, decisively:\u000a\u000a"Your young friend has a strong case, but I advise you to see Mrs.\u000aMiddleton privately.
p5211
aVIt may not be necessary to bring the matter into\u000acourt; and this would be preferable, as it would avoid scandal."
p5212
aV"I put myself in your hands," said Tony, promptly.
p5213
aV"Mrs. Harvey Middleton is in London," said the lawyer.
p5214
aV"I will call\u000athis afternoon."
p5215
aVCHAPTER XL.
p5216
aVALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL.
p5217
aVMrs. Harvey Middleton sat in her boudoir, trying to read a novel.
p5218
aVBut\u000ait failed to interest her.
p5219
aVShe felt uneasy, she scarcely knew why.
p5220
aVThe evening previous she had been at the Haymarket Theatre, and had\u000abeen struck by a boy's face.
p5221
aVTen feet from her sat Tony, with his\u000afriend, George Spencer.
p5222
aVHe looked wonderfully like his father, as she\u000aremembered him, and she was startled.
p5223
aVShe did not know Tony, but Rugg's\u000aangry warning struck her.
p5224
aV"Was he right?
p5225
aVCan this be the boy I have so much reason to dread?"
p5226
aVshe\u000aasked herself.
p5227
aVShe was thinking of this when the servant entered the room with a card.
p5228
aV"C. Barry," she repeated, "wishes to see Mrs. Middleton on business of\u000athe greatest importance."
p5229
aV"Ask him to come up," she said, uneasily.
p5230
aVIt was the lawyer, as the reader may have suspected.
p5231
aV"Mrs. Middleton," he said, with a bow, "I must apologize for my\u000aintrusion."
p5232
aV"You say your business is important," said the lady.
p5233
aV"It is--of the first importance."
p5234
aV"Explain yourself, I beg."
p5235
aV"I appear before you, madame, in behalf of your late husband's cousin,\u000aAnthony Middleton, who is the heir of the estate which you hold in\u000atrust."
p5236
aVIt was out now, and Mrs. Middleton was at bay.
p5237
aV"There is no such person," she said.
p5238
aV"The boy you refer to is dead."
p5239
aV"What proof have you of his decease?"
p5240
aV"I have the sworn statement of the man who saw him die."
p5241
aV"And this man's name?"
p5242
aV"Is Rudolph Rugg."
p5243
aV"I thought so.
p5244
aVMr. Rugg swore falsely.
p5245
aVHe is ready to contradict his\u000aformer statement."
p5246
aV"He has been tampered with!"
p5247
aVexclaimed Mrs. Middleton, pale with\u000apassion.
p5248
aV"That may be," said the lawyer; but he added, significantly, "Not by\u000aus."
p5249
aV"The boy is an impostor," said Mrs. Middleton, hotly.
p5250
aV"I will not\u000asurrender the estate."
p5251
aV"I feel for your disappointment, madame; but I think you are hasty."
p5252
aV"Who will believe the statement of a common tramp?"
p5253
aV"_You_ relied upon it before, madame.
p5254
aVBut we have other evidence,"\u000acontinued the lawyer.
p5255
aV"What other evidence?"
p5256
aV"The striking resemblance of my young friend to the family."
p5257
aV"Was--was he at the Haymarket Theatre last evening?"
p5258
aV"He was.
p5259
aVDid you see him?"
p5260
aV"I saw the boy I suppose you mean.
p5261
aVHe had a slight look like Mr.
p5262
aVMiddleton."
p5263
aV"He is his image."
p5264
aV"Suppose--suppose this story to be true, what do you offer me?"
p5265
aVasked\u000aMrs. Middleton, sullenly.
p5266
aV"An income of three hundred pounds from the estate," said the lawyer.
p5267
aV"If the matter comes to court, this Rugg, I am bound to tell you, has\u000aan ugly story to tell, in which you are implicated."
p5268
aVMrs. Middleton knew well enough what it meant.
p5269
aVIf the conspiracy should\u000abe disclosed, she would be ostracised socially.
p5270
aVShe rapidly made up her\u000amind.
p5271
aV"Mr. Barry," she said, "I will accept your terms, on a single\u000acondition."
p5272
aV"Name it, madame."
p5273
aV"That you will give me six weeks' undisturbed possession of the estate,\u000akeeping this matter secret meanwhile."
p5274
aV"If I knew your motive, I might consent."
p5275
aV"I will tell you in confidence.
p5276
aVWithin that time I am to be married.
p5277
aVThe abrupt disclosure of this matter might break off the marriage."
p5278
aV"May I ask the name of the bridegroom?"
p5279
aV"Captain Gregory Lovell."
p5280
aVThe lawyer smiled.
p5281
aVHe knew of Captain Lovell, and owed him a grudge.
p5282
aVHe\u000asuspected that the captain was mercenary in his wooing, and he thought\u000athat it would be a fitting revenge to let matters go on.
p5283
aV"I consent, upon my own responsibility," he said.
p5284
aV"Thank you," said Mrs. Middleton, with real gratitude.
p5285
aVShe would not lose the man she loved, after all.
p5286
aV*       *       *       *       *       *       *\u000a\u000aA month later the marriage of Captain Gregory Lovell, of Her Majesty's\u000aservice, and Mrs. Harvey Middleton, of Middleton Hall, was celebrated.
p5287
aVThere was a long paragraph in the Morning "Post," and Mrs. Lovell was\u000ahappy.
p5288
aVWhen, a week later, at Paris, the gallant captain was informed of the\u000atrick that had been played upon him, there was a terrible scene.
p5289
aVHe\u000acursed his wife, and threatened to leave her.
p5290
aV"But, Gregory, I have three hundred pounds income," she pleaded.
p5291
aV"We\u000acan live abroad."
p5292
aV"And I have sold myself for that paltry sum!"
p5293
aVhe said, bitterly.
p5294
aVBut he concluded to make the best of a bad bargain.
p5295
aVBetween them they\u000ahad an income of five hundred pounds, and on this they made shift\u000aabroad, where living is cheap.
p5296
aVBut the marriage was not happy.
p5297
aVHe was\u000abrutal at times, and his wife realized sadly that he had never loved\u000aher.
p5298
aVBut she has all the happiness she deserves, and so has he.
p5299
aVRudolph drank himself to death in six months.
p5300
aVSo the income which he\u000awas to receive made but a slight draft upon the Middleton estate.
p5301
aVAnd Tony!--no longer Tony the Tramp, but the Hon.
p5302
aVAnthony Middleton,\u000aof Middleton Hall--he has just completed a course at Oxford, and is\u000anow the possessor of an education which will help fit him for the\u000aresponsibilities he is to assume.
p5303
aVHis frank, off-hand manner makes him\u000aan immense favorite with the circle to which he now belongs.
p5304
aVHe says\u000alittle of his early history, and it is seldom thought of now.
p5305
aVHe has\u000amade a promise to his good friend, George Spencer, to visit the United\u000aStates, and will doubtless do so.
p5306
aVHe means at that time to visit once\u000amore the scenes with which he became familiar when he was A POOR\u000aBOY.
p5307
aVWHITMARSH'S REVENGE.
p5308
aVRoger Blake and Belcher Whitmarsh were both called quite good boys,\u000abut for different reasons.
p5309
aVAs their friends used sometimes to put it,\u000aBelcher was liked _because_ of his temper, and Roger was liked _in\u000aspite of_ his temper.
p5310
aVRoger was quick to fly into a passion, and as quick to get over it,\u000awhile Belcher was almost always good natured, but when once really\u000aoffended remembered the offense like an Indian.
p5311
aVThe broad play-green in front of the country schoolhouse, where the\u000aboys spent their term times together, was surrounded by trees and rocky\u000apasture lots.
p5312
aVA pretty brook ran through it.
p5313
aVOn the sides of the brook\u000aand in the rain-gulleys there were plenty of pebbles and small stones.
p5314
aVOne noon, when the boys had begun a trial of skill in firing stones at\u000aa mark, an unlucky turn was given to this small "artillery practice" by\u000athe thoughtless challenge of one of the youngsters to a playmate:\u000a\u000a"I stump you to hit _me_."
p5315
aVThe stones soon began to fly promiscuously, and the play grew more\u000alively than safe.
p5316
aVThe boys became excited and ran in all directions,\u000aexclaiming "Hit _me_, hit _me_!"
p5317
aVThe missiles were dodged with exultant\u000alaughter, and the shots returned with interest.
p5318
aVAs must be supposed, some of the players were really hit, and sore\u000aheads, and backs, and limbs made the sham skirmish before long a good\u000adeal like a real battle.
p5319
aVBelcher Whitmarsh was about the only really cool fellow on the ground.
p5320
aV"Come, fellows," he remonstrated, "this is getting dangerous.
p5321
aVWhat's\u000athe good of throwing stones when you're mad?
p5322
aVIt's poor play, any way."
p5323
aV"Ho, you're afraid," shouted Roger Blake, and in this he was joined by\u000aseveral others.
p5324
aVRoger had received one rather hard thump, and feeling quite fiery about\u000ait determined to be "even with somebody."
p5325
aVHe kept on hurling right and\u000aleft reckless of consequences.
p5326
aVBelcher paid no attention to the derision with which his words were\u000atreated.
p5327
aVHe was preparing, with one or two companions, to leave the\u000aplayground when he saw Roger near him with a heavy stone in his hand\u000adrawing back for a furious throw.
p5328
aVPartly in sport and partly out of regard for the lad aimed at, he\u000astepped behind the excited boy and caught his arm.
p5329
aVRoger whirled about instantly in a great heat.
p5330
aVAs Belcher stepped\u000aquickly backward, laughing, he let fly the stone at him with all his\u000aforce, crying:\u000a\u000a"Take it yourself, then!"
p5331
aVThe stone struck Belcher full in the face, breaking two of his front\u000ateeth and knocking him down.
p5332
aVSeeing what he had done, Blake sobered in an instant and ran to the aid\u000aof his fallen schoolfellow.
p5333
aV"I didn't mean to, Belcher," said Roger, bending over him remorsefully,\u000aand evidently afraid he had killed him.
p5334
aVThe boys began to express their indignation quite loudly, but Blake\u000amade no attempt to defend himself, only hanging over the injured lad,\u000aand declaring how sorry he was.
p5335
aV"Come," pleaded he, "try to get up, and let me help you down to the\u000aschoolhouse--I'll pay the doctor anything in the world to make you well\u000aagain."
p5336
aVBut Whitmarsh, as soon as he recovered a little, showed that he\u000aresented his sympathy as bitterly as he did his blow.
p5337
aVPushing away his hand spitefully, he staggered to his feet with the\u000ahelp of another boy, and holding his handkerchief to his bloody face\u000amoved off the green, sobbing with pain and revengeful rage.
p5338
aVBy the time school commenced he had been assisted to wash and bind up\u000ahis bleeding mouth, when he started for home, giving Roger a look which\u000awas very seldom seen on his face, but which meant plainly enough:\u000a\u000a"I'll have the worth of this out of your skin some day, see if I don't!"
p5339
aVThat afternoon the boys received a sound lecture from the teacher on\u000athe evil of throwing stones, and a penalty was imposed upon the leaders\u000ain the reckless sport, Roger among them, who, however, in consideration\u000aof his penitence, was only charged with a message to his parents,\u000amaking full confession and submitting his case entirely to their\u000ajudgment.
p5340
aVDays passed, and everything went on much as before at the school, save\u000athat Belcher Whitmarsh was missed, being at home healing his wound.
p5341
aVEvery day that his absence was noticed was to Roger's quick feelings\u000alike a new condemnation.
p5342
aVNo one was more pleased, then, than Roger Blake to see Belcher, after a\u000alittle more than a week had passed, back at his place in school.
p5343
aVHe soon found, however, that bygones were not to be bygones between\u000athem.
p5344
aVBelcher not only refused to respond to his hearty congratulations, but\u000ashowed by his manner and words (hissed through his broken teeth) that\u000aso far from forgiving Roger's offense he meant to lay it up against him.
p5345
aVSeveral times when thrown in close company with him Blake tried to\u000adisarm his dislike.
p5346
aV"Come," he would say, "now, Belch, shake hands and say quits."
p5347
aVBut Whitmarsh would only answer with a surly half threat, or grin\u000asignificantly, to expose the notch in his gums where the teeth were\u000agone.
p5348
aVThe boys saw this unreasonable dislike, and gradually transferred their\u000asympathy to Roger.
p5349
aVAt last the school closed, and though Belcher was not cordial the\u000awhole affair between the two lads seemed likely to be soon forgotten.
p5350
aVOne day during vacation, as Roger was picking whortleberries with two\u000aother boys in a lonely pasture, he was unexpectedly joined by Belcher,\u000awho had come thither on the same errand.
p5351
aVIt was not noticed that they greeted each other very differently from\u000athe usual manner of boys, and during the whole time they were together\u000aBelcher behaved himself in a way that made neither Blake nor his\u000acompanions feel any the less at ease for his company.
p5352
aVLeast of all had\u000athey any reason to suspect that he still harbored his old revenge.
p5353
aVA ruined house, many years deserted, stood in sight of the spot where\u000athe boys were picking, and growing tired of their work they agreed to\u000ago and examine the old building, and perhaps take a game of "hi spy"\u000athere.
p5354
aVAs they went over the house they found a trap-door opening into\u000aa small vault, which had evidently once been used for the family\u000acellar--for the ancient dwelling was rather cramped in size and\u000aaccommodations--and, boy-like, they all went down into the moldy hole.
p5355
aVAs the last boy was descending the rotten ladder tumbled to pieces\u000aunder his weight, and the adventurous youngsters found themselves\u000acaught like the fox and goat in the well.
p5356
aVPhilip Granger, however, being a lad of quick resources, soon hit upon\u000athe fox's plan of getting out, which was that each should climb the\u000ashoulders of a comrade, and when all but one were safely above ground\u000athese should join in pulling out the last.
p5357
aVThe plan was varied a little in practice, as it was awkward business to\u000adecide who of them should be the "goat."
p5358
aVPhil got up first, climbing over Frank Staples, and then aided his\u000ahelper out.
p5359
aVBelcher, who had made a ladder of Roger Blake, was performing the\u000apulling of his generous companion toward the opening, when a sudden\u000ayell was heard outside, and crying out "There come Dirk Avery and Ben\u000aTrench!"
p5360
aVFrank and Phil darted away, running as if for their lives.
p5361
aVSeized with their panic, Belcher instantly dropped Roger, and\u000aregardless of his terrified calls rushed from the hut in a twinkling.
p5362
aVThe jar of the hurried departure of the boys over the rickety floor\u000abrought down the trap-door with a bang, and Roger was left a prisoner\u000aindeed.
p5363
aVDirk Avery and Ben Trench were two bad characters who lived a sort of\u000ahalf-vagabond life, rarely doing any honest work, and whose savage\u000alooks and cruel natures made them the terror of all the children of the\u000aneighborhood.
p5364
aVTheir appearance in any place was the signal for a general stampede of\u000athe young people who happened to be about.
p5365
aVThere was not one in our\u000alittle whortleberry party who was not as much afraid of them as if they\u000ahad actually worn horns and hoofs.
p5366
aVOn this occasion they were out on a fishing tramp, and the contents\u000aof a bottle of cheap rum that each of them carried had made them more\u000awicked than usual.
p5367
aVAccordingly, they were in just the mood to take all possible advantage\u000aof the fright they had caused, and when the boys fled so precipitately\u000afrom the ruined house they pursued them with horrible threats and\u000ashouts of hoarse laughter.
p5368
aVFrank and Phil ran toward the lot where they had hidden their baskets,\u000athe loud voice of Dirk crying, "Skin the rascals!
p5369
aVWring their necks!"
p5370
aVDirk, however, soon overdid himself, for the two boys were fleet of\u000afoot, and saved their breath.
p5371
aVThey finally got away, with their berries.
p5372
aVBelcher struck a bee-line for home, forgetting his basket, and though\u000aBen gave him a hot chase he succeeded in distancing him.
p5373
aVPoor Roger!
p5374
aVFor some minutes after he found himself shut fast in the\u000avault his mortal fear of being found by the two roughs left him no\u000acourage to cry out, and gave him no time to think whether he ought to\u000ablame Belcher or not.
p5375
aVJudging his act by his own feelings then, he could not say but he\u000ashould have done the same.
p5376
aVBut the immediate fright soon passed, and he began to feel the real\u000amisery of his situation.
p5377
aVNobody but Whitmarsh knew where he was.
p5378
aVWhat if he _should_ leave him\u000athere, for the old grudge?
p5379
aVAnd then it came to him how singular it\u000awas that the one on whom he depended to help him out should be just\u000a_he_--the boy who had threatened him.
p5380
aVWearily enough passed the time to Roger down there in the dismal hole.
p5381
aVNeither shout nor scream would help him.
p5382
aVNo one lived within half a\u000amile of the house; or if his cries should chance to be heard it might\u000abe Avery and Trench, and they would certainly bring him more hurt than\u000agood.
p5383
aVSuddenly he heard footsteps.
p5384
aVA hand seized the trap-door and lifted it.
p5385
aVBelcher Whitmarsh's face looked into the vault.
p5386
aV"Hollo," said Roger joyfully, "I thought you'd be back before long.
p5387
aVNow\u000alet's get out of this--I've had enough of it, I'm sure."
p5388
aVBut Belcher only grinned, showing the vacancy in his front teeth, and\u000areplied coolly:\u000a\u000a"Want me to help you out?"
p5389
aV"Of course.
p5390
aVDon't be fooling now," pleaded Roger.
p5391
aV"Well," said Belcher, "I've thought it over, and seeing you're in there\u000aso nicely _I've concluded I won't_.
p5392
aVI've an old score against you.
p5393
aVPerhaps you'd like to pay it now."
p5394
aVWith that he dropped the trap-door, and made off.
p5395
aVHe had come after his basket of berries.
p5396
aVWould he be heartless enough\u000ato go home now and leave his schoolmate in that damp hole, pestilent\u000awith mildew and haunted, perhaps, by sliding adders and loathsome\u000acreatures?
p5397
aVMeantime the parents of Roger, when the hour passed at which he was\u000aexpected home, began to make inquiries for him.
p5398
aVFrank Staples and\u000aPhilip Granger, who both supposed he had climbed out of the vault and\u000aran away with Belcher from the hut, were much surprised when asked\u000awhere he was, and told that he had not returned.
p5399
aVTheir story of the encounter with Dirk Avery and Ben Trench made the\u000aparents still more anxious.
p5400
aVPossibly their boy had come to some harm at the hands of those drunken\u000aruffians.
p5401
aVWould Philip mind going over to the pasture again and showing\u000ajust where it all happened?
p5402
aVPhilip gladly consented, and getting leave from home accompanied Mr.\u000aBlake to the lot where they had gathered their berries.
p5403
aVRoger's basket was found untouched, precisely where he had been seen to\u000ahide it.
p5404
aVMr. Blake looked pale and Phil began to feel frightened.
p5405
aV"Let's go down to Mr. Whitmarsh's," said Mr. Blake, "and see Belcher."
p5406
aVIt was now about sundown, but as the old house lay not far out of the\u000away it was decided to visit it.
p5407
aVNo sooner had they reached it and looked in than Phil exclaimed, "The\u000atrap-door is shut.
p5408
aVI'm sure 'twas open when we left it."
p5409
aVIn a moment more they had uncovered the vault and found poor Roger.
p5410
aVOverjoyed, they helped him out, a good deal the worse for the hunger\u000aand fear he had undergone.
p5411
aVThe story of Belcher's mean revenge was soon noised abroad.
p5412
aVHe excused\u000ahimself by saying he meant to leave Roger only a little while for a\u000ajoke, but his father made him go to Mr. Blake's and apologize for his\u000awanton trick.
p5413
aVWe must do Belcher the justice to say that he performed the duty\u000apromptly and with apparent frankness and sincerity.
p5414
aVThere is no\u000adoubt, however, that he meant harm--not such serious harm as might\u000ahave occurred--but sufficient injury to his playfellow to satisfy his\u000amalignant feelings and glut his revenge.
p5415
aVThe spirit he exhibited was\u000athe same in kind, although not in degree, as that which makes a man a\u000amurderer.
p5416
aVA true man never allows anger to get the permanent control of his\u000afeelings.
p5417
aVHe knows its mean and dangerous tendencies, and remembers the\u000awords of Him who spake as never man spake: "If ye forgive not men their\u000atrespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."
p5418
aVTHE BOY IN THE BUSH.
p5419
aV"The impudent scoundrel!
p5420
aVJust look at this, mamma.
p5421
aVI should like to see\u000ahim at it," exclaimed Sydney Lawson in great wrath, as he handed his\u000amother a very dirty note which a shepherd had brought home.
p5422
aVOn coarse,\u000acrumpled grocer's paper these words were written in pencil:\u000a\u000a\u000a     "Master Sidney i Want your Mare the chesnit with the white starr,\u000a     soe You Send her to 3 Mile flat first thing Tomorrer Or i Shall\u000a     Have to cum an Fetch Her.
p5423
aV"WARRIGAL."
p5424
aV"Sam says," Sydney went on to say, "that the fellow was coward enough\u000ato give it him just down by the slip-panels.
p5425
aVHe wouldn't have dared to\u000atalk about sticking us up if he hadn't known father was away.
p5426
aVSend him\u000amy mare Venus!
p5427
aVI seem to see myself doing it!"
p5428
aVSidney Lawson, who made this indignant speech, was a tall, slim lad\u000aof fourteen.
p5429
aVHe and his mother had been left in charge of the station\u000awhile his father took some cattle to Port Philip.
p5430
aVSydney was very proud of his charge; he thought himself a man now, and\u000awas very angry that Warrigal, a well-known desperado, should think he\u000acould be frightened "like a baby."
p5431
aVWarrigal was a bushranger who with one or two companions wandered about\u000ain that part of New South Wales, doing pretty much as he liked.
p5432
aVThey\u000astopped the mail, and robbed draymen and horsemen on the road by the\u000atwo and three dozen together.
p5433
aVThe police couldn't get hold of them.
p5434
aVThe note that Sydney had received caused a great deal of excitement in\u000athe little station.
p5435
aVMiss Smith, who helped Mrs. Lawson in the house, and taught Sydney's\u000asisters and his brother Harry, was in a great fright.
p5436
aV"Oh!
p5437
aVpray send him the horse, Master Sydney," she cried, "or we\u000ashall all be murdered.
p5438
aVYou've got so many horses one can't make any\u000adifference."
p5439
aVMrs. Lawson was as little disposed as Sydney to let Mr. Warrigal do\u000aas he liked.
p5440
aVShe knew that her husband would have run the risk of\u000abeing "nabbed," if he had been at home, rather than have obeyed the\u000abushranger's orders; and that he would be very pleased if they could\u000amanage to defy the rascal.
p5441
aVStill it was a serious matter to provoke Messrs. Warrigal & Co. to pay\u000athe house a visit.
p5442
aVShe felt sure that Sydney would fight and she meant\u000ato fire at the robbers herself if they came; but would she and Sydney\u000abe able to stand against three armed men?
p5443
aVNot a shepherd, or stockman, or horse-breaker about the place was to\u000abe depended on; and Ki Li, the Chinaman cook, though a very good kind\u000aof fellow, would certainly go to bed in his hut if the robbers came\u000aby day, and stay in bed if the robbers came by night.
p5444
aVJohn Jones, the\u000aplowman, whose wife was Mrs. Lawson's servant, slept in the house, and\u000ahe was too honest to band with the bushrangers in any way; "but then,\u000ahe's such a _sheep_, you know, mamma," said Sydney.
p5445
aVThere was time to send word to the police in Jerry's Town; but who was\u000ato go?
p5446
aVKi Li would be afraid to go out in the dark, and John Jones would be\u000aafraid to ride anything but one of the plow horses, and that only at an\u000aamble.
p5447
aVIt wouldn't do for Sydney to leave the place, since he was the\u000aonly male on it who was to be depended upon, so what was to be done?
p5448
aVLittle Harry had heard his mother and brother talking; and as soon as\u000ahe made out their difficulty he looked up and said:\u000a\u000a"Why, mamma, _I_ can go.
p5449
aVSyd, lend me your stock-whip and let me have\u000aGuardsman."
p5450
aVNeither mother nor brother had any fear about Harry's horsemanship, but\u000athey scarcely liked to turn the little fellow out for a long ride by\u000anight.
p5451
aVHowever, he knew the way well enough, and if he did not fall in with\u000aany of the Warrigal gang nobody would harm him.
p5452
aVSo Sydney put the saddle and bridle on Guardsman and brought him\u000around to the garden-gate, where Harry stood flicking about Sydney's\u000astock-whip very impatiently, while his mamma kissed him and tied a\u000acomforter round his neck.
p5453
aVHarry shouted "Good-night," gave Guardsman his head, and was off like a\u000awild boy.
p5454
aVSydney stabled Venus, his favorite mare, and--an unusual\u000aprecaution--turned the key in the rusty padlock; and when he had given\u000aa look about the outbuildings it was time for him to go in to supper\u000aand family prayers.
p5455
aVHe read the chapter and Mrs. Lawson read the prayers.
p5456
aVShe was a brave\u000awoman, but with her little girls about her and her little boy away she\u000acouldn't keep her voice from trembling a little when she said, "Lighten\u000aour darkness, we beseech thee, O Lord; and by Thy great mercy defend us\u000afrom all perils and dangers of this night."
p5457
aVSydney went into his mother's bedroom and looked at the blunderbuss\u000athat stood by the bedhead (Mrs. Lawson had selected the blunderbuss as\u000aher weapon, because she thought she "must be sure to hit with that big\u000athing") and he showed her once more how to pull the trigger.
p5458
aVThen he bade her "good-night," and went along the veranda to his own\u000alittle room at one end, where he locked himself in, and drew the charge\u000aof his rifle and loaded it again, and looked at the chambers of his\u000arevolver, and put the caps on, and laid it down on a chair, ready to\u000ahis hand.
p5459
aVWhen his preparations were completed he said his prayers and tumbled\u000ainto bed with his clothes on.
p5460
aVHarry wasn't expected home until the next day.
p5461
aVHe had been told to\u000asleep at the tavern in Jerry's Town, when he had left his message at\u000athe barracks, and come home at his leisure in the morning.
p5462
aVAbout four miles from Wonga-Wonga, the dreariest part of the road to\u000aJerry's Town, begins a two-mile stretch of dismal scrub.
p5463
aVHarry put his\u000aheels into Guardsman's sides to make him go even faster than he was\u000agoing when they got into the scrub, and was pleased to hear a horse's\u000ahoofs coming toward him from the other end.
p5464
aVHe thought it was a neighbor riding home to the next station; but it\u000awas Warrigal.
p5465
aVAs soon as Harry pulled up Guardsman to chat a minute,\u000aWarrigal laid hold of the bridle and pulled Harry on to the saddle\u000abefore him.
p5466
aV"Let's see, you're one of the Wonga-Wonga" (that was the name of his\u000afather's station) "kids, ain't you?"
p5467
aVsaid the robber.
p5468
aV"And where are\u000ayou off to this time of night?
p5469
aVOh, oh, to fetch the traps, I guess; but\u000aI'll put a stop to that little game."
p5470
aVJust then Harry gave a _coo-ey_.
p5471
aVHe couldn't give a very loud one, for\u000ahe was lying on a sack on the robber's horse; but it made Warrigal very\u000asavage.
p5472
aVHe put the cold muzzle of a pistol against Harry's face and said, "You\u000ascreech again, youngster, and you won't do it no more."
p5473
aVAnd then Warrigal took Harry and the horses into the scrub, and gagged\u000aHarry with a bit of iron he took out of his pocket, and tied him up to\u000aa crooked old honeysuckle-tree with a long piece of rope he carried in\u000ahis saddle-bags.
p5474
aV"Don't frighten yourself, I'll tell yer mar where you are, and you'll\u000abe back by breakfast," said Warrigal, as he got on Guardsman and rode\u000aoff, driving his own tired horse before him.
p5475
aVNext morning, just as the day was breaking, Warrigal and his two mates,\u000awith crape masks on, rode up to Wonga-Wonga.
p5476
aVThey made as little noise as they could; but the dogs began to bark and\u000awoke Sydney.
p5477
aVWhen he woke, however, Warrigal had got his little window open, and was\u000acovering him with a pistol.
p5478
aVSydney put out his hand for his revolver, and though Warrigal shouted,\u000a"Throw up your hands, boy, or I'll shoot you through the head," he\u000ajumped out of bed and fired.
p5479
aVHe missed Warrigal, and Warrigal missed him; but Warrigal's bullet\u000aknocked Sydney's revolver out of his hand, and one of Warrigal's\u000amates made a butt against the bedroom door and smashed it; and he and\u000aWarrigal rushed into the room, and threw Sydney down on the bed, and\u000apinioned his arms with a sheet.
p5480
aVThe other bushranger was watching the horses.
p5481
aVBy this time the whole station was aroused.
p5482
aVThe men peeped out of their\u000ahuts, half frightened, half amused; not one of them came near the\u000ahouse.
p5483
aVJohn Jones and his wife piled their boxes against their room\u000adoor, and then crept under the bed.
p5484
aVMiss Smith went into hysterics; and Gertrude and her sisters couldn't\u000ahelp looking as white as their night-dresses.
p5485
aVMrs. Lawson had fired off her blunderbuss, but it had only broken\u000atwo panes of the parlor window, and riddled the veranda posts; so\u000aWonga-Wonga was at the bushrangers' mercy.
p5486
aVThey ransacked the house, and took possession of any little plate, and\u000ajewelry, and other portable property they could find.
p5487
aVWhen the robbers\u000ahad packed up what they called the "swag," and put it on one of their\u000ahorses, they pulled Ki Li out of bed, and made him light a fire, and\u000acook some chops and boil some tea.
p5488
aVThen they marched Mrs. Lawson, and Miss Smith, and Sydney, and his\u000asisters, and Mr. and Mrs. Jones, and Ki Li, into the keeping-room, and\u000asat down to breakfast, with pistols in their belts, and pistols laid,\u000alike knives and forks, on the table.
p5489
aVThe bushrangers tried to be funny, and pressed Mrs. Lawson and the\u000aother ladies to make themselves at home, and take a good meal.
p5490
aVOne of\u000athe robbers was going to kiss Miss Smith; but Sydney, pinioned as he\u000awas, ran at him, and butted him like a ram.
p5491
aVHe was going to strike Sydney; but Gertrude ran between them, calling\u000aout, "Oh, you great coward!"
p5492
aVand Warrigal felt ashamed, and told the\u000aman to sit down.
p5493
aV"We call him Politeful Bill," Warrigal remarked, in apology; "but he\u000aain't much used to ladies' serciety."
p5494
aVWhen breakfast was over, Warrigal asked Sydney where the mare was.
p5495
aV"Find her yourself," said Sydney.
p5496
aV"Well, there won't be much trouble about that," answered Warrigal.
p5497
aV"She's in the stable, I know; and you've locked her in, for I tried\u000athe door.
p5498
aVI suppose you are too game to give up the key, my young\u000afighting-cock?
p5499
aVBut since you're so sarcy, Master Sydney, you shall see\u000ame take your mare.
p5500
aVYou might as well ha' sent her instead of sending\u000afor the police, and then I shouldn't ha' got the bay horse too;" and he\u000apointed to Guardsman, hung up on the veranda.
p5501
aVThere was no time to ask what had become of Harry.
p5502
aVWarrigal hurried Sydney by the collar to the stable, while the other\u000amen mounted their horses, and unhooked Guardsman, to be ready for their\u000acaptain.
p5503
aVWarrigal blew off the padlock with his pistol; but Venus was fractious,\u000aand wouldn't let him put on her halter.
p5504
aVWhile he was dodging about the\u000astable with her, Sydney heard hoofs in the distance.
p5505
aVNearer and nearer\u000acame the _tan-ta-ta-tan-ta-ta-tan-ta-ta_.
p5506
aVFour bluecoats galloped up to the slip-panels, three troopers and a\u000asergeant; the sergeant with Harry on his saddlebow.
p5507
aVIn a second Harry was down, and in three seconds the slip-panels were\u000adown too.
p5508
aVThe waiting bushrangers saw the morning sun gleaming on their carbines,\u000aas the police dashed between the aloes and the prickly pears, and\u000aletting Guardsman go, were off like a shot.
p5509
aVSydney banged to the stable door; and, setting his back against it,\u000ashouted for help.
p5510
aVHis mother, Gertrude, and even John Jones, as the\u000apolice were close at hand, ran to his aid; and up galloped the troopers.
p5511
aVWarrigal fired a bullet or two through the door, and talked very big\u000aabout not being taken alive; but he thought better of it, and in an\u000ahour's time he was jogging off to Jerry's Town with handcuffs on, and\u000ahis legs tied under his horse's belly.
p5512
aVIf Warrigal had not taken up little Harry, most likely he would not\u000ahave been caught; for when Harry had got to Jerry's Town, he would have\u000afound all the troopers away except one.
p5513
aVIn the scrub, however, Harry\u000aheard the sergeant and his men returning from a wild-goose chase they\u000ahad been sent on by the bush telegraphs; and managing at last to spit\u000athe gag out of his mouth, he had given a great _co-oo-oo-oo-oo-ey_.
p5514
aVAfter that night Miss Smith always called Sydney _Mr._ Sydney; and\u000aSydney let Harry ride Venus as often as he liked.
p5515
aVTHE MIDNIGHT RIDE.
p5516
aVIt was half-a-dozen years before the war that Godfrey Brooks made a\u000avisit to his Cousin Sydney in Virginia.
p5517
aVIt was his first glimpse of\u000aplantation life, and he was not sparing of his questions or comments.
p5518
aVBoys in a strange place find it hard to carry about with them the\u000apoliteness or reticence which are such easy fitting garments at home.
p5519
aVThe two boys were standing on the piazza one sunny morning looking down\u000ato the distant swamp.
p5520
aV"You mean to tell me," said Godfrey hotly, "that gentlemen hunted their\u000arunaway slaves out of the swamp with bloodhounds?
p5521
aVBloodhounds?"
p5522
aV"No, I don't.
p5523
aVGentlemen, of course, do no such dirty work.
p5524
aVIn the\u000afirst place, our people (we don't call them slaves) never run away.
p5525
aVWhy, bless you, old Uncle Peter there, was a boy with my grandfather,\u000aand I'm sure I like him a deal better.
p5526
aVOf all the hundreds of men and\u000awomen my father owns, there's not one that don't respect and love him.
p5527
aVBut there's a class of whites who are not so respected, and when their\u000apeople escape they bring them back--that's all."
p5528
aV"It's brutal," muttered Godfrey.
p5529
aV"A man has a right to reclaim his property," said Syd coolly.
p5530
aVNow neither of the boys knew much of the intrinsic merits of the\u000aquestion.
p5531
aVThey only echoed the words and arguments their elders threw\u000aback and forth unceasingly.
p5532
aVWhen Syd began to give the details of\u000athe late hunt after a runaway horse-thief in the swamp, therefore,\u000aGodfrey's moral indignation cooled in the borrowed ardor of the chase.
p5533
aV"You see," Syd said in conclusion, "Boosey was really a criminal of\u000athe worst sort, as well as a slave, and he belonged to old Johnson.
p5534
aVJohnson's the man that owns the hounds.
p5535
aVThat's his place beyond the\u000ahill.
p5536
aVHe's a whiskey distiller, and raises slaves for the market.
p5537
aVOh,\u000aof course he's tabooed.
p5538
aVEven a decent laborer looks down on a man that\u000araises slaves for the market."
p5539
aVThe boys went out fishing presently, and Godfrey looked with a thrill\u000aof horror into the dark thicket of laurel and poisonous ivy as they\u000apassed where Boosey was still hidden.
p5540
aVDown in his secret soul there\u000awas an idea of the fierce and terrible zest of hunting anything--even\u000aa man--with a bloodhound, through that tragic dusk and quagmire.
p5541
aVIt\u000awould be akin to the gladiatorial combats between man and beast of old\u000aRome, or the bull-fights of the plaza, which his gentle Cousin Anne had\u000alearned to relish in Madrid.
p5542
aV"What do you say to riding over to Col.
p5543
aVPage's to-night?"
p5544
aVsaid Syd at\u000asupper.
p5545
aV"The girls want to practice some new music before the next\u000aparty.
p5546
aVIt's only six now.
p5547
aVWe can ride over in an hour."
p5548
aV"All right," said Godfrey.
p5549
aV"Remember, boys," said Dr. Brooks, "you are to be at home and in bed by\u000aten."
p5550
aVFor Syd's father, while he bestowed horses, guns, every accessory\u000ato pleasure upon his son with an unstinting hand, yet held a tight rein\u000aon him and never allowed him to fancy that he was a man and not in\u000areality a child.
p5551
aV"We'll be home by ten, sir," the boys said promptly.
p5552
aVNow Godfrey was but a schoolboy, and at home only snubbed and kept\u000ain place by a half-dozen grown brothers and sisters.
p5553
aVThis riding out\u000aat night, therefore, on a pony, which for the time was his own; this\u000acalling on young ladies to whom he was known as Mr. Brooks, of New\u000aYork, was an ecstatic taste of adult freedom which almost intoxicated\u000athe boy.
p5554
aVWhen nine o'clock came, and Syd beckoned him from the sofa,\u000awhere he was reading "Locksley Hall" to Miss Amelia Page, he rose so\u000aunwillingly as to cause Joe Page to look from his game of backgammon.
p5555
aV"It's too bad in the doctor to put your cousin into strict prison\u000aregulations, Syd," he said.
p5556
aV"I'll go, however, and see about your\u000ahorses."
p5557
aVHe came back with a queer twinkle in his eye.
p5558
aV"Sam declares he hitched\u000athem securely; but they're gone now.
p5559
aVSit down, boys, sit down.
p5560
aVYou may\u000aas well make the best of it.
p5561
aVThe fellows are after them.
p5562
aVThey'll be\u000ahere by and by."
p5563
aVSyd looked annoyed.
p5564
aV"I believe Joe unhitched them, himself.
p5565
aVI promised\u000afather I'd be back early."
p5566
aVHowever he sat down quietly and waited.
p5567
aVGodfrey had no annoyance to hide.
p5568
aVIt wanted but ten minutes to eleven o'clock that night when the ponies\u000awere brought to the door, and the boys, after many hand-shakings and\u000acordial invitations, were allowed to depart for home.
p5569
aVThen the glow of gallantry and manhood began to cool in Godfrey's\u000abosom, and the unpleasant tremor to take its place which was wont to\u000aovercome him when he was late at school.
p5570
aV"I say, Syd, I wish we were at home," he said, mounting.
p5571
aV"I wish we were," gloomily.
p5572
aV"Will your father be very angry?"
p5573
aV"It isn't that.
p5574
aVBut I never broke my word to him before, never.
p5575
aVI know\u000awhat he thinks of a man that breaks his word.
p5576
aVThe road is heavy.
p5577
aVIt's a\u000agood ride for an hour and a half," shutting his watch with a snap.
p5578
aV"Is there no short cut?"
p5579
aV"Yes, there's one," looking at him dubiously; "but it's through\u000aJohnson's place."
p5580
aV"The dogs--they're not loose, eh?"
p5581
aV"That I don't know.
p5582
aVHe keeps them chained in daytime, of course, but\u000awhether the scoundrel looses them at night or not I never heard.
p5583
aVIt\u000awould be just like him."
p5584
aVThe boys rode on in silence.
p5585
aVSuddenly Syd drew up with a jerk.
p5586
aV"Here's\u000athe gate into Johnson's, and I tell you what it is I must go this way,\u000adogs or no dogs.
p5587
aVI'm in honor bound to try to keep my promise as nearly\u000aas I can, no matter what lies in the way.
p5588
aVYou can ride down the hill;\u000aI'll wait for you at the house."
p5589
aV"No, sir; I'm with you," feeling himself every inch a man at the\u000achance of an adventure.
p5590
aV"Open the gate, Syd.
p5591
aVNow come on!"
p5592
aVand giving\u000atheir horses the rein they struck into a gallop down the road leading\u000aclose by Johnson's house and stables.
p5593
aVIt was so heavily covered with\u000atan-bark that the sound of the hoofs was deadened, and the boys spoke\u000ain whispers, afraid to stir the midnight silence.
p5594
aVSyd nodded toward a low kennel, back of the stables.
p5595
aV"There!"
p5596
aVhe motioned with his lips.
p5597
aV"There's where they were when they\u000atook them to hunt Boosey."
p5598
aVBut kennel and stables were silent and motionless in the cold moonlight.
p5599
aVThe tan-bark was replaced by pebbles near the house.
p5600
aVThe boys took\u000atheir ponies up on the short velvet turf, on which their swift feet\u000afell with a crisp, soft thud, a noise hardly sufficient to rouse the\u000amost watchful dog, but which drove the blood from Godfrey's cheeks.
p5601
aVHis\u000ashort-lived courage had oozed out.
p5602
aV"A man one could fight," he thought.
p5603
aV"But to be throttled like a beast\u000aby a dog."
p5604
aVThe gladiatorial fights of Rome did not thrill him so much\u000anow as the thought of them had sometimes done.
p5605
aVThud--thud.
p5606
aVEvery beat of the hoofs upon the grass sounded through the\u000aboys' brains.
p5607
aVThey were up to the kennels--past them--safe.
p5608
aVTwo minutes\u000apassed and not a sound.
p5609
aVGodfrey drew a long breath, when--hark!
p5610
aVA long, deep bay, like thunder, sounded through the night.
p5611
aV"God save us!
p5612
aVThey're loose and are after us," gasped Syd.
p5613
aVGlancing back they saw two enormous black shapes darting from behind\u000athe shadow of the porch, and coming down the slope behind them.
p5614
aV"Now, Pitch and Tar!"
p5615
aVsang out Syd, "it all rests on you."
p5616
aVHe shouted\u000aas cheerily, Godfrey thought, as though he were chasing a hare.
p5617
aVChasing\u000aand being chased were different matters, both the boys thought; though\u000athere was a reckless, gay defiance about the Southern boy which his\u000acousin lacked, courageous as he was.
p5618
aVThe ponies seemed to catch the meaning of Syd's call.
p5619
aVThey looked back.
p5620
aVTheir feet scarcely touched the sward, their nostrils were red, their\u000aeyes distended.
p5621
aVAfter the first fierce howl the dogs followed in silence.
p5622
aVThey had no\u000atime to give tongue; they had work to do.
p5623
aVA long stretch of pebbly road lay before the boys, then there was a\u000athick patch of bushes, and beyond, the gate.
p5624
aVThere was no doubt of the horses keeping up their pace.
p5625
aVTerror served\u000athem for muscle and blood.
p5626
aVBut the hounds were swifter of foot at any\u000atime.
p5627
aVThey gained with every minute.
p5628
aVThe distance was about fifty yards.
p5629
aV"Can we do it?"
p5630
aVGodfrey asked.
p5631
aVHis tongue was hot and parched.
p5632
aV"Of course we'll do it, unless the gate is locked."
p5633
aVAfter this new dread came they were silent.
p5634
aVGodfrey thought of home,\u000ahis mother, and poor little Nell; wished he had not snubbed her as he\u000aused to do.
p5635
aVSyd felt desperately in his pockets, where he found only a penknife.
p5636
aVWhy would not his father let him carry firearms as the other boys?
p5637
aVSuddenly turning to Godfrey he made a gesture, and turned his horse\u000afull on the hedge of privet.
p5638
aVIt leaped boldly--Godfrey's followed.
p5639
aVBut\u000athe hounds followed, relentless as fate, and dashed through the lower\u000abranches.
p5640
aVThey were closer than before.
p5641
aV"The gate!
p5642
aVthe gate!"
p5643
aVcried Syd.
p5644
aVHe had reached it and fumbled for the\u000abolt.
p5645
aVGodfrey, a dozen paces behind, fancied he felt the tramp of the\u000apowerful beasts shake the ground.
p5646
aVHe turned, saw them coming with open\u000ajaws, closer, closer.
p5647
aVWould the gate never open?
p5648
aVThere was a creak and crash, and it rolled\u000aback on its rusty hinges.
p5649
aVThe horses darted through so violently as to\u000athrow Godfrey on the ground.
p5650
aVWhen he looked up Syd was standing beside\u000ahim, and from the other side of the iron bars came the baffled roar of\u000athe angry beasts.
p5651
aVThe boys rode home without a word.
p5652
aV"What about reclaiming property by means of bloodhounds, Syd?"
p5653
aVasked\u000aGodfrey.
p5654
aV"It's brutal," cried Syd vehemently, and then he laughed.
p5655
aV"I tell you,\u000aGodfrey, one must actually take another man's place before he can be\u000aquite just to him, eh?"
p5656
aVA THOUSAND A YEAR.
p5657
aV"I am afraid Daniel must give up his studies," Mrs. Brooks said, sadly.
p5658
aV"I've been thinking how we are to meet the expenses of another year,\u000aand it seems quite impossible to get money enough to do so."
p5659
aV"Oh, it would be such a pity, and brother so nearly through," Susan\u000asaid, looking up in a distressed way.
p5660
aV"He mustn't leave college now,\u000awhen he is so near graduating!
p5661
aVThere _must_ be a way of helping him\u000athrough."
p5662
aVMrs. Brooks stooped to kiss the pale, tender face upturned to hers.
p5663
aV"You have a wise little head, Susan, but I am afraid there is a problem\u000ahere you cannot solve," said the widow, mournfully.
p5664
aV"How much will be needed?"
p5665
aV"At least a hundred dollars besides what he will earn himself.
p5666
aVYou know\u000athere are always extra expenses for the graduating class."
p5667
aVSusan's countenance fell.
p5668
aVIt was a great sum in her estimation, and it\u000awas already difficult for them to meet their weekly expenses.
p5669
aV"Everything depends upon brother's success," Susan said, presently.
p5670
aV"We must give up everything for him."
p5671
aV"I cannot forget I have _two_ children," the mother said, kissing the\u000agirl again more tenderly than before.
p5672
aV"Two children; but only one that will be a blessing to you," Susan\u000asaid, brushing away a tear.
p5673
aV"Don't say that, Susie.
p5674
aVI am proud of Daniel, I do not deny that--but I\u000alove you, too, all the same."
p5675
aV"But you never can be proud of me, weak and deformed as I am!
p5676
aVOh,\u000amother, why are some flowers made so beautiful and fragrant, and some\u000aso dark and noisome?
p5677
aVWhy was my brother so fair, so talented, and I so\u000arepulsive?"
p5678
aV"No, no, no, not repulsive; don't say that," the widow cried, putting\u000aher arms around the girl in a sheltering way.
p5679
aV"Do you think Daniel will let me go to see him take his diploma,\u000amother?"
p5680
aV"You would not be able, dear."
p5681
aVThe girl laughed bitterly.
p5682
aV"No; brother would say I was not able, too.
p5683
aVBut I should be glad, so\u000avery glad to see him graduate.
p5684
aVI think I would be willing to die then."
p5685
aV"Hush, my darling," the mother cried, with a sharp pain in her voice.
p5686
aV"When you are gone I shall soon follow.
p5687
aVDaniel will be satisfied with\u000ahis laurels, but women--ah, my child--women must love something, and\u000ayou are all that is left me to love."
p5688
aVSusan nestled her head in her mother's bosom without speaking, and lay\u000athere so long that her mother thought she was sleeping.
p5689
aVSuddenly she\u000aopened her eyes and said:\u000a\u000a"I have thought it all out, mother.
p5690
aVDaniel can graduate, and we will go\u000asee him take his diploma.
p5691
aVMr. Green needs girls to braid straw hats.
p5692
aVYou know I am nimble with my fingers, and I could braid a thousand a\u000ayear, and that would be how much?"
p5693
aV"But it would be wicked for me to allow you to overtask yourself in\u000athat way, darling.
p5694
aVI am not sure but it might ruin your health, feeble\u000aas you are.
p5695
aVNo, no, it is not to be thought of."
p5696
aV"How many might I undertake, mother?"
p5697
aV"Not half that amount; not a third, even."
p5698
aV"Would Daniel be willing for me to braid, do you think?"
p5699
aV"I don't know.
p5700
aVWe will ask him."
p5701
aV"Mother," Susan said, looking into her eyes, "I believe this is my\u000amission, to educate Daniel.
p5702
aVYou know we have given him everything--my\u000aportion of the property and yours.
p5703
aVI think I could hold out to do this\u000alast, and you will consent when you come to reflect upon what it will\u000abe to brother, and to you, when I am gone.
p5704
aVBut he must not know it.
p5705
aVIt\u000awould wound his pride, and he would get some false notion in his head\u000athat he could not use money I had earned in that way.
p5706
aVNow, promise me,\u000athat let what will come, you will never tell him that I braided straw\u000ahats that he might complete his education."
p5707
aV"I cannot promise _never_ to tell him, darling, because I cannot\u000aforesee the future, but I should not like him to be humbled and\u000awounded, more than yourself.
p5708
aVI am too old to learn readily, but perhaps\u000aI, too, could earn something by braiding."
p5709
aVThe determination was now fully settled in the mind of each, that the\u000ayoung man must graduate, and that the bills must be met by them.
p5710
aVThe\u000apatronage of Mr. Green was solicited, and it was agreed the work should\u000abe taken home, and that a thousand hats should be braided for ten cents\u000aeach, which he assured them was more than he would think of paying to\u000aany one else, and only to Susan in consideration of her infirmity.
p5711
aVWe ought, perhaps, to explain that Susan had been early afflicted with\u000aa curvature of the spine, which had sadly deformed her.
p5712
aVShe would never\u000ahave been a beautiful girl, Daniel having inherited not only all the\u000afamily talent, but its beauty as well.
p5713
aVBut her eyes were wondrously\u000aattractive, with their loving, yearning persuasiveness, and few could\u000aremember her deformity who had felt the warmth of her generous nature.
p5714
aVIn due time, the anticipated letter of inquiry came from Daniel,\u000aasking what the prospects were for the coming year.
p5715
aVIt was full of\u000adismal forebodings and egotistical complaints of the hard fortune that\u000amade him dependent upon his mother, but there was no regret that she\u000asuffered too; no longing to be a man that he might take this lonely\u000acouple in his strong arms and bear them tenderly over the rough places\u000aof life; only vague, ambitious dreamings of what he was to be to the\u000aworld, and the world to him.
p5716
aVThe widow laid down the letter with a sigh.
p5717
aVSusan read the pages over\u000aand over again.
p5718
aVSo grounded was she in her love for this earthly idol\u000athat the selfishness was less apparent to her than to her mother.
p5719
aVIts sadness seemed like tenderness, and he could not speak too often\u000aor too much of the genius which she believed he possessed, and which\u000awould some time break upon the world like the meteor to which he rather\u000atritely compared himself.
p5720
aV"Ah, we shall be so proud of him!"
p5721
aVSusan said, folding the letter and\u000alaying it away near her heart, where it rested many and many a day,\u000awhile she wove the strands of straw in and out, thinking how ten times\u000aten made one dollar, and how the dollars would some time count up to a\u000ahundred, and that sum, which her fingers had wrought out, would save\u000aher brother from discouragement, if not from despair.
p5722
aVThe first twenty-five dollars was earned, and the money was sent the\u000abrother.
p5723
aV"He was very glad of it," he said.
p5724
aV"He had begun to fear lest they\u000awould fail him."
p5725
aVThere was no inquiry how it had been obtained;\u000ano solicitude lest those who loved him had deprived themselves of\u000aluxuries, perhaps necessities, to meet his demands.
p5726
aVThe next twenty-five dollars was earned, with greater difficulty.
p5727
aVThe\u000awidow was awkward at braiding, and her work unsatisfactory, and so\u000asome of it was returned to Susan.
p5728
aVShe sat up later nights, that her\u000amother should not see how hard the work pressed upon her; but the\u000atwenty-five dollars came at last, and was sent to the student.
p5729
aVThen\u000athere was another letter of thanks.
p5730
aV"If you would but rest, darling," the mother would say, when some look\u000amore wan than another startled her into keener anxiety.
p5731
aV"When it is done we will rest together," was all the reply the\u000asolicitude brought.
p5732
aVIt was too late to retract now, the mother thought; and Daniel so\u000anearly through!
p5733
aVSo they pinched a little from their daily meals, a\u000alittle from the store of candles, a little from the evening fire, and\u000aprayed that every penny might be multiplied like the widow's meal.
p5734
aVOne night Mrs. Brooks had gone to bed exhausted and hysterical with\u000aoverlabor.
p5735
aVSusan pressed the blankets tenderly around her mother's\u000ashoulders, and having given her the good-night kiss, and quieted her\u000awith many promises of soon following her, she went back to the kitchen\u000afire and resumed the weary braiding.
p5736
aVShe had not completed her usual task that week, and the idea occurred\u000ato her that her mother having fallen asleep, she could braid another\u000ahat before retiring.
p5737
aVSo she set up new strands and the thin fingers\u000awove them patiently in and out, until sharp pain clutched her with\u000amerciless teeth, and she leaned forward, her head falling upon the\u000atable, in a dead faint.
p5738
aVIt was long past midnight when Susan found herself in this position.
p5739
aVShivering with cold, she crept to her mother's side and lay the\u000aremainder of the night, racked by alternate fevers and chills.
p5740
aVHow could the poor child tell her mother of what she knew was creeping\u000aso steadily toward her?
p5741
aVWould she make a final effort to save her own\u000alife and let Daniel struggle with his fortunes as he best could?
p5742
aVPoor, brave little heart, with the chill of the grave stealing over\u000ait, but warmed back into life and renewed suffering by the wonderful\u000astrength of its undying love!
p5743
aVAnother twenty five dollars was forwarded to Daniel, and a few lines\u000acame flying back by the return post, for Daniel was a man of business\u000ahabits, and punctual in all things.
p5744
aVSusan looked it all over carefully for some loving message to her; some\u000asign answering to what she felt in her own heart toward him, but there\u000awas nothing there but "_With love to Susan, I remain, etc., Daniel._"\u000a\u000aA dry sob escaped the poor child as she laid it by, and took up the\u000aweary, rustling braids.
p5745
aVThe sound rasped upon her nerves now.
p5746
aVThe very\u000aodor of the strands nauseated her.
p5747
aVEvery kink in the braids fretted\u000aher; and when one hat was finished and laid aside, it seemed such a\u000amountainous task to commence another.
p5748
aVSometimes hours would pass by without a round being accomplished, then\u000aagain the nimble fingers would be inspired, and the work would grow as\u000aof old.
p5749
aV"If I could only go and see Daniel take his diploma," she would say,\u000a"I think it would make me strong again.
p5750
aVI would wear my white muslin\u000afrock, with the blue sash, and he would not be ashamed of me."
p5751
aVBut it was not to be.
p5752
aVThe one thousand hats were braided, and Susan's\u000atask was done.
p5753
aVNothing remained for her but to lie down in her modest\u000acasket and sleep with folded hands until the blessed Saviour shall bid\u000aher approach to receive His welcome--"Well done, thou good and faithful\u000aservant."
p5754
aVDaniel returned with his collegiate honors only to listen to the sad\u000astory of her labors and death.
p5755
aVHis mother told it as they stood by the\u000acoffin.
p5756
aVThere were the worn letters she had cherished, blistered all\u000aover with tears.
p5757
aVHe was conscience stricken when he looked them over, and saw how cold\u000aand egotistical they were, and how thoughtless he had always been of\u000athe treasure that death had taken.
p5758
aVHe took the thin hands in his--the\u000ahands that had braided and plaited while he slept, and wrought out\u000athe treasure-trove that molded the key to his success, and he made\u000asolemn resolutions for the future.
p5759
aVLet us hope that, in her broken\u000alife, he learned how beautiful in the sight of God and angels is the\u000aself-sacrifice of the lowly in heart: and how much better it is to\u000adie in the struggle to bless others than it is to live to a selfish,\u000aunloving, unsanctified old age.

p6859
aVThey too, somehow, failed\u000ato inspire that sluggish bit of pointed gold.
p6860
aVNeither do your sober\u000aneighbors, friend, as I think of them.
p6861
aVIn all essentials they might\u000abe my own.
p6862
aVFor we are all a care-worn people, we of this young West,\u000amoving always circumspectly, hedging ourselves round with a tenfold\u000awall against surprises, with creeds and codes and philosophies\u000ainnumerable, all warranted Hell-proof and Heaven-kissing._\u000a\u000a_We count him wisest who lives and loves and dies most by rule.
p6863
aVAnd\u000athe rule is that rule of our Tory Grecian forbears, "Never too much."
p6864
aV"We may be a wise people and a happy people," said I to myself, "but\u000awe are quite too prudent to be counted young, in anything but years."
p6865
aVAnd so that bit of gold hung uninspired as when it left the shop.
p6866
aVIt\u000awaited for livelier, more zestful topics than the daily grind of\u000asober middle age._\u000a\u000a_Then all at once, it seemed, familiar voices called to me from that\u000aEast we deem so old, and I was back there.
p6867
aVA street stretched\u000abeneath me, such a street as only the Far East knows, and there only\u000ain one enchanted city.
p6868
aVIt was a wide street, and a long one, all\u000aaquiver with hot, stinging sunlight.
p6869
aVIt was walled with solid,\u000afour-square houses, and above them roofs and pinnacles rose in a\u000ahundred fantastic, airy shapes for which our Western architecture has\u000ano names, and the fronts of the houses flashed with decorations of\u000abarbaric red and gold.
p6870
aVThe street flamed with them.
p6871
aVAnd all down\u000athe spacious, sun-flooded length of it, filling it from brim to brim,\u000alike a river, poured a current of tumultuous life._\u000a\u000a_From out the crowd eyes met mine, just as they used to do.
p6872
aVEyes of\u000amen intent on conquest, of goods, perhaps, or power, or pleasure, the\u000aeyes of men who sought, not soberly.
p6873
aVMocking, inviting, smiling,\u000afathomless, straightforward eyes of women, who, forgetting, or\u000aunknowing Heaven and Hell, still knew that they were women,\u000amistresses of a woman's joys and sorrows.
p6874
aVEyes of losers at the\u000agame, unhopeful but uncowed.
p6875
aVThousands of eyes glanced up at me, and\u000anot one solitary pair of them were like the eyes that look out\u000asoberly from your neighbor's head, or mine._\u000a\u000a_As my eyes questioned theirs, it seemed to me again, just as it used\u000ato do, that there in the old East, where life began, it still throbs\u000amost strongly, tingles most with the hot blood of youth; that there\u000amen, eternally young, are still most unafraid, grasp with least\u000ahesitation all life offers them, and accept the outcome of their\u000achoice with most sincerity._\u000a\u000a_As I was thinking that, it seemed to me that I went down into the\u000alife and stinging sunshine of the street, and mingled with it, till\u000aat last my steps led me down an alley and across a drawbridge that\u000aspanned a green and pestilential moat, and I approached the low\u000agateway of a gray Walled City which was old when History was young.
p6876
aVI passed under the cavern of the gate--and my feet rang on the worn\u000aflagstones as I passed--and came into a narrow street between low,\u000asombre houses without windows, and so presently to a temple which in\u000athat city bears an unpleasant reputation.
p6877
aVNot that scandal hangs\u000aabout it--it takes Christian tongues to make libertines and guzzlers\u000aof Christian priests.
p6878
aVBut it is said that for some few centuries\u000aexperiments in--in Psychical Research, let us say--have been going on\u000ain that old temple of Tzin Piau, with results that are not always\u000areassuring to a lay beholder.
p6879
aVI was in too careless a mood to care\u000afor that, that morning, and the porter let me pass, barbarian that I\u000awas, and I crossed the great courtyard and came to a little cell\u000abuilt in the thickness of the walls._\u000a\u000a_Inside the cell I saw an old, old man, a priest, though but a\u000aheathen one, half reclining on a hollowed slab of stone._\u000a\u000a_He was a very gaunt old man, but a very tall and strong one, and his\u000aface was like a mask of yellow parchment, seamed with a multitude of\u000atiny wrinkles, and his eyes were two slits set slantwise in it.
p6880
aVBut\u000aas he heard my step and looked up, they widened, and the spark of a\u000asmile glimmered in them._\u000a\u000a_"It is you again, my son?"
p6881
aVsaid that old heathen priest to me in\u000agreeting, though I did not remember having seen him before that day.
p6882
aV"What is it now?
p6883
aV"_\u000a\u000a_Suddenly I knew why I had come.
p6884
aV"My father," I said, though he was\u000abut a heathen, "I want to see Life through your eyes.
p6885
aV"_\u000a\u000a_He looked into me, and through me, and beyond me into vacancy, and\u000aas he looked the spark of laughter in his eyes danced, and flickered\u000aup into a tiny fire.
p6886
aV"You are older now," said he.
p6887
aV"Sit down.
p6888
aVI\u000awill tell you first of the Game of the Little Gods, and then you\u000ashall see Life through my eyes.
p6889
aV"_\u000a\u000a_"The Little Gods?"
p6890
aVI asked, squatting on the floor.
p6891
aVIt was the only\u000aseat he had to offer me._\u000a\u000a_"The Great God," my heathen priest explained, unheeding me and\u000asmiling into vacancy, "the Great God created us men in his own\u000aimage--and soon found us, as objects of His constant contemplation,\u000adistinctly wearisome.
p6892
aVIf He could have laughed, it would not have\u000amattered much, but Amusement is beneath the ken of a Great God.
p6893
aVTherefore our inconsistencies, our pettinesses, our hopeless\u000acontradictions, quickly wearied Him, as they would us if we had to\u000atake them seriously, forever.
p6894
aVAnd so," drawled my heathen tutor,\u000a"the Great God, at last, in self-defense, created some Little Gods to\u000atake charge of the everyday affairs of men.
p6895
aVSo far as they are Gods,\u000aof course, these Little Gods are Eternal and Impartial, far raised\u000aabove Love and Aversion, Pity and Scorn, Admiration and Derision, and\u000aall our other small emotions.
p6896
aVTo them all things are equal.
p6897
aVBut so\u000afar as they are Little, and not Great, they are capable of Amusement.
p6898
aVAnd so," said he, "those lucky Little Gods while away Eternity by\u000aplaying games, wherein we men are counters.
p6899
aVBut we men too," he\u000aadded, smiling through me into vacancy, "if we are wise, can gain\u000aamusement by looking on at the games we're part of.
p6900
aV"_\u000a\u000a_"I," said I, "have never noticed anything which looked like games--"_\u000a\u000a_"No?"
p6901
aVhe said, half mockingly.
p6902
aV"You never watched a strong man\u000astrive his utmost and grasp at last what he strove for, a handful of\u000aashes and dry leaves?
p6903
aVNever saw a woman love with all her heart,\u000atill she broke it, loving?
p6904
aVNever saw Tragedy or Comedy or Farce\u000awherein the players were not actors?
p6905
aVHave all Life's\u000acontradictions--"_\u000a\u000a_"But they've always taught me," I objected, "that in those seeming\u000acontradictions, an inscrutable Wisdom was working for the ultimate\u000agood of those--"_\u000a\u000a_"My son," said my old heathen priest, stretching his old legs out on\u000ahis stony slab, "go and see for yourself.
p6906
aVThis is the hour when I\u000atake one of my naps.
p6907
aVSee for yourself.
p6908
aV"_\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER I\u000a\u000aFAGAN\u000a\u000aI found myself "up the railroad," as we used to say, in a\u000awell-remembered town.
p6909
aVIt had not changed since I saw it last.
p6910
aVThe\u000arailroad still ran through it, straight as a pencil-stroke ruled\u000aacross the flat lands, and the rails, on their embankment, shimmered\u000ain the sun like two unending bars of white-hot metal.
p6911
aVThe cart road\u000astill wallowed into it, and out of it, for the town is set on an\u000aisland in the marshy level of the paddies.
p6912
aVThe crazy huts of nipa,\u000aand crazier, decaying houses, still stood thick on either side of the\u000aone street.
p6913
aVAnd brown women in skirts of gaudy calico still sat under the shadow\u000aof wide shutters, dispensing such goods as Poverty can buy, while\u000atheir babies and their pigs rolled comfortably together in the dust.
p6914
aVThe shaggy thatch still rustled in the sultry breeze, and a few\u000adejected palm-trees clicked their branches as of old.
p6915
aVAnd, very far\u000aaway across the waveless green sea of the half-grown rice, the same\u000adark and threatening mountains towered into the clouds.
p6916
aVIt was all\u000aunchanged.
p6917
aVThe merciless sun struck down just as hotly.
p6918
aVThe very\u000asmells were smells I had often smelled before.
p6919
aVSuddenly there was a stir of excitement in the town.
p6920
aVThe women\u000acrawled from the litter of their wares.
p6921
aVThe men, lighting fresh\u000acigarettes from the remnants of their old ones, stood up to gaze.
p6922
aVFor down the street was coming, with the curious in-toeing shuffle of\u000aa barefoot mountaineer, a squat, huge-muscled, naked man.
p6923
aVHe carried a long, broad-bladed spear in his right hand, and a\u000ahead-axe was thrust through his belt, and at his back a bag, swollen\u000aas if it held something big and round, bobbed and dangled heavily,\u000aand something dripped from it slowly, thickly, in the dust.
p6924
aVThe\u000aman's broad, sweat-streaked face was all agrin with excitement and\u000agood-nature, but the natives of the town shrank back from him as he\u000apassed.
p6925
aV"Donde 'Mericanos?"
p6926
aVhe kept asking eagerly.
p6927
aVA bystander pointed to a house, one a little taller than the others,\u000awhere a flag of dingy white, barred with dingier red and blue, hung\u000adrooping, and a group of tall, lean, sun-bronzed men dressed in\u000afrayed shirts of blue flannel, and breeches of stained and faded\u000akhaki, and battered campaign hats, were lounging in the dusty shade.
p6928
aVThe bystander pointed to them, and the naked man, his face stretching\u000ain a wider grin, broke into a clumsy trot and ran to them.
p6929
aV"Me got," he said, and pulled the heavy, bobbing bag from his\u000ashoulders, and thrust it at them.
p6930
aVThey fell back hastily.
p6931
aV"It's\u000asomething, all right," said one of them judicially.
p6932
aV"Something\u000aplenty dead.
p6933
aVSergeant," he called, "I reckon it's your deal.
p6934
aVHere's\u000aan Igaroot with another dead-head lookin' for you."
p6935
aVAnd the others\u000alaughed.
p6936
aVAt that an oldish man with a long, drooping, gray moustache, and gray\u000aeyes that were bright below their sun-burned lids, stepped from the\u000adoor.
p6937
aVThe naked man cried out again, "Me got," and held out his\u000adripping bag.
p6938
aVAnd the saturnine old sergeant fell back, as the men\u000ahad done.
p6939
aV"You open it, Johnnie," he commanded.
p6940
aV"It's too dead for me.
p6941
aV_Patay, sabe?_  Me no likum thataway.
p6942
aV_Icao abieria_."
p6943
aVSo the man undid the string that bound his bag, and opened it, and\u000athe sergeant took one peep inside.
p6944
aV"It's a big American nigger, all\u000aright," he announced.
p6945
aV"And he's sure dead.
p6946
aVIt might be him.
p6947
aVBetter\u000acall the Captain over here, some one; I don't reckon he wants _that_\u000ain his quarters.
p6948
aVWhere you catch him, hombre?"
p6949
aVThe little man jerked his chin over his shoulder at those distant\u000amountains.
p6950
aV"You buy?"
p6951
aVhe asked anxiously.
p6952
aV"You'll get the reward all right, if it's him," said the sergeant\u000areassuringly.
p6953
aV"But you'll have to wait till it's identified.
p6954
aVThere've been a lot of duplicates brought in, _sabe_."
p6955
aVPresently other men in khaki and flannel, who in spite of their\u000aundress showed, somehow, as officers, came down the street, and they,\u000aand the sergeant, and the man with the bag, went into the house.
p6956
aVAfter a long wait, an orderly came out, pale and shaken, and turned\u000atoward the military telegraph station.
p6957
aV"It's him," he said briefly,\u000ato his waiting fellows.
p6958
aV"That Contract Dentist in there knowed him\u000aby his teeth.
p6959
aVGod!
p6960
aVI'm plumb glad I ain't no kind of medico."
p6961
aVThe men looked at each other, silently, for a long minute.
p6962
aVThe\u000aspirit of jesting seemed to have left them.
p6963
aVThe judicial one spoke\u000afirst.
p6964
aV"Well, he got _his_ good and hard at last," said he.
p6965
aV"But he\u000asure got a run for his money."
p6966
aVThen I understood what it was all about.
p6967
aVI wrote of that thing in\u000athe bag once, not knowing it then for a pawn in the Game of the\u000aLittle Gods.
p6968
aVThere was a time when men called it Fagan.
p6969
aVWhile Fagan was still a kinky-haired youngster, clad only in the\u000atraditional shirt, a question forced itself on his attention.
p6970
aV"Why\u000aain't I got a pappy?"
p6971
aVhe asked his mother, and the great,\u000adeep-bosomed woman laughed the deep, melodious laugh of her race.
p6972
aV"Lawszee, honey, I raickon you has," she replied.
p6973
aV"Mos' chillen has."
p6974
aV"Who is my pappy?"
p6975
aVthe child persisted.
p6976
aVThe woman laughed again.
p6977
aV"Lawszee, chile, how you spaik me to\u000a'maimber that?
p6978
aVI'se got other things to 'maimber, I raickon."
p6979
aVWe couldn't expect much of a Fagan, born of that race and class, and\u000ahe learned not to expect much of us.
p6980
aVA bit of food, a bit of\u000aclothing, and a chance to roll around on the levee with the other\u000apickaninnies, and bask in the sunshine and sniff the sweety-sour\u000asmells from the sugar-ships, sufficed him.
p6981
aVFor many years these\u000apleasures were his for the taking.
p6982
aVAnd as he grew older they still\u000asufficed, with the addition of a little cheap tobacco and cheaper\u000agin, and he found that a modicum of labor and a care never to offend\u000aone of the heaven-born white race would procure them.
p6983
aVThe labor was\u000aeasy, for the son of the deep-bosomed, supple-limbed woman had grown,\u000aas the rank, free growth of a swamp shoots up, into a great, broad,\u000agraceful man to whom the toil of others was mere play.
p6984
aVAnd he was of\u000aa nature so easy-going and joyous and childishly obliging that the\u000aheaven-born pointed him out with approval as "a nigger like we had\u000abefore the war."
p6985
aVHe might have lived on thus indefinitely, but one day, over a lazy\u000aroll of the dice, another black man took advantage of his known good\u000anature.
p6986
aVAnd Fagan, the kindly, felt a sudden, blinding impulse to\u000astrike.
p6987
aVThe huge black fist shot out like lightning under the\u000aimpulse of the supple, writhing muscles, and the other man dropped\u000awith a broken neck.
p6988
aVThen Fagan came to the Army, and the Army received him with joy.
p6989
aVThe\u000asurgeon's eye glistened with an artist's fervor as he thumped and\u000akneaded the great, perfect animal, and a wise old recruiting sergeant\u000aguided the pen for him to sign his name.
p6990
aVThus he was made welcome in\u000athat most catholic of societies, which cares not a whit for your\u000apast, your present, or your future, so long as you have mind and body\u000asufficient to obey orders.
p6991
aVBut even this slight requirement was much for Fagan.
p6992
aVHis careless,\u000asoapless, buttonless existence was a poor training for the rigid\u000aminuti of military life.
p6993
aVAnd he was unfortunate in his immediate\u000acommander.
p6994
aVMost of the officers of the Fifty-fourth were of the\u000aSouth, able to deal firmly yet kindly with the big black children\u000acommitted to their charge.
p6995
aVBut Sharpe was new to the Army, the son\u000aof a small tradesman in the North, and had an exalted reverence for\u000athe Regulations, and his own rank.
p6996
aVSo when he saw that the buttons\u000aof Fagan's blouse were uncleaned, one morning at guard-mounting, he\u000adid not announce the fact impersonally, as an officer should.
p6997
aVAnd Fagan, in serene ignorance of any law against immediate\u000aexplanation, replied with boyish, surprised chuckle, "Lawszee,\u000aLootenant, I raickon I plumb forgot them buttons."
p6998
aV"That's enough," snapped the officer.
p6999
aV"Sergeant, put this man under\u000aarrest."
p7000
aVFagan followed to the guard-house, mildly expostulant.
p7001
aV"He suah'd\u000aorter give me a fairah show," he said to the sergeant.
p7002
aV"I was jus' a\u000agwine to tell him.
p7003
aVI didn't mean no hahm.
p7004
aVAll I wanted was a fayah\u000ashow."
p7005
aV[Illustration: "_All I wanted was a fayah show._"]\u000a\u000aThus began a series of petty persecutions.
p7006
aVFagan, with his good\u000anature, tried his best, but the Lieutenant would not be pleased.
p7007
aVHe\u000awas not a bad sort in intent, simply a common, weak, official bully.
p7008
aVSuch men usually resign early, or if they linger on in the service,\u000alearn to shun getting in front of their men when there is firing.
p7009
aVBy the time the regiment was ordered to the Philippines Fagan's\u000arecord loomed black with five trials.
p7010
aVBut the campaigning brought\u000arelief.
p7011
aVA man was required only to have his rifle in good condition,\u000aand be on hand to use it.
p7012
aVThe regiment spent weary days, dragging\u000aabout like a slow snake under the burning sun, soaking and shivering\u000ain the mists of evening, till men began to sicken.
p7013
aVBut not Fagan.
p7014
aVHis melodious bellow would ring triumphant along the lines each\u000anight, "I'se been wo'okin' on the ra'alroad," and cheer the drooping\u000amen, till the voices of the company wits were demanding, "Who's dat\u000aar white man got a ra'alroad?"
p7015
aVAnd then, one day, the scouts reported that the main body of the\u000aenemy was near, that elusive body for which the regiment had been\u000agroping so long.
p7016
aVAfter a little the snake broke out into a fan, and\u000awent crawling across a muddy rice-paddy toward a cane-brake.
p7017
aVThen a\u000aflight of strangely drawling insects sang overhead, and as always,\u000awhen firing is wild and high, some men in the reserve, 'way in the\u000arear, lay down very suddenly.
p7018
aVThe merry bugles rattled, and the fan dissolved into a thin brown\u000aline of men who advanced swiftly to the edge of the brake, firing as\u000athey went.
p7019
aVAnd then, all at once, the brake was alive with dizzily\u000aflashing steel.
p7020
aVA little brown man rose in front of Fagan, and a\u000aflash darted straight at his head.
p7021
aVInstinctively his muscles\u000areacted, and he ducked backward like a boxer.
p7022
aVSo the bolo missed his\u000ahead, but the sharp point, tearing downward, ripped through shirt and\u000aflesh on his breast.
p7023
aVFagan stared stupidly at the dripping red edges of the blue cloth\u000atill the sharp tingle of the flesh stirred him.
p7024
aVAs before, he felt a\u000ablinding impulse to strike, and whirled his heavy rifle in one hand,\u000aas a boy might a stick.
p7025
aVHe looked down at the quivering, moaning\u000athing before him, and a mad joy of strength surged over him.
p7026
aVA\u000alittle way apart a struggling group was weaving in and out with darts\u000aof steel and quick flashes of rifles, and hoarse gruntings and\u000acursings.
p7027
aVHe ran toward it, swinging his broken rifle round his\u000ahead.
p7028
aV"Give 'em heyell, boys," he shouted.
p7029
aV"Kill the damn niggers."
p7030
aVFrom that day he was called Wild Fagan, and Fagan the Nigger-Killer,\u000aand as the campaign progressed, his renown passed beyond his\u000aregiment.
p7031
aV"Heard about that wild nigger in the Fifty-fourth?"
p7032
aVasked\u000athe Cavalry, borrowing a pinch of Durham and a pit of paper from the\u000aMountain Battery.
p7033
aV"Don't sabe fire his rifle.
p7034
aVJust butts in and\u000aswats 'em with it, like he was wantin' to play gollf."
p7035
aVThe story\u000agrew till the Marines, returning from shore service, told the Fleet,\u000ahalf-seriously, of a wild regiment come straight from Africa, "what\u000aonly knew how to fight with war-clubs."
p7036
aVAnd jacky, ever ready to\u000abelieve, swore softly in admiration, and spat over the rail, and\u000adreamed of having a little go with that regiment, some night in\u000aNagasaki, when every one had had about seven drinks all round.
p7037
aVEven the officers began to boast.
p7038
aV"Oh, you mean our man Fagan," the\u000aColonel would say to guests at mess.
p7039
aV"Yes, he's a good man.
p7040
aVExpensive--a rifle lasts him about a day when things are lively;--but\u000aefficient.
p7041
aVYes, highly efficient.
p7042
aVThe natives are beginning to\u000adodge the regiment.
p7043
aVYes, I'll let you see him after dinner.
p7044
aVFinest\u000abuild of a man you ever laid eyes on.
p7045
aVLike a cat, you know, like a\u000acat and a grizzly rolled into one."
p7046
aVAnd Fagan through it all was unchanged, good-natured, childlike as\u000aever.
p7047
aVHe was even a bit ashamed of his strength.
p7048
aV"That little scrap\u000adown by the bridge?"
p7049
aVhe would say to a group of admirers.
p7050
aV"Oh, that\u000aall wa'n't nothin'.
p7051
aVThat big Fillypeeno?
p7052
aVOh, yes, I hit him.
p7053
aVYes,\u000aI raickon I smashed him some," he would muse with his slow smile.
p7054
aV"I\u000abroke my gun on him.
p7055
aVAnybody got any tobacca?
p7056
aVI nevah can keep no\u000atobacca."
p7057
aVIt was after the fighting was done and the regiment went into\u000astations of companies in the villages that the change began to come.
p7058
aVThe men, keyed to exertion and excitement, found the idleness of\u000abarrack life first pleasant, then irksome.
p7059
aVAnd they were at home in\u000athese sunny islands, far more at home than ever in the States.
p7060
aVThey\u000aread the freedom of the land in the burning sky, and the clicking\u000apalms, and the lazy air.
p7061
aVMore than anywhere else, they read it in\u000athe dark, admiring eyes of the brown, slim, soft-moving girls.
p7062
aVThe\u000amen began to be absent at check roll-call at Taps.
p7063
aVThen all the wisdom and tact of an officer was needed.
p7064
aVToo great\u000aeasiness meant loss of control, harshness meant desertions.
p7065
aVFor a\u000atime Lieutenant Sharpe did very well.
p7066
aVHe overlooked what he could,\u000aand was unangered in his firmness when he must be firm.
p7067
aVBut nature\u000aand fixed habit overcame him, and Fagan was naturally the chief\u000asufferer, for the officer had grown into the belief that Fagan was\u000athe probable cause of every misdemeanor in the company.
p7068
aVSo it was a\u000areprimand, and then another sharper, and then the summary\u000acourt--where the Lieutenant was prosecutor and jury and\u000ajudge--sentenced Fagan to the loss of a month's pay for attempting to\u000arun the guard at some unearthly hour of the night.
p7069
aVWithin a week he\u000arepeated the offence, and Lieutenant Sharpe, with the fear of God and\u000athe Regulations in his heart, and wondrous small understanding in his\u000ahead, sentenced him to a "month and a month."
p7070
aVA month of confinement\u000awill give any man much time for reflection, and the Lieutenant hoped\u000ait might prove salutary.
p7071
aVFagan received his sentence with ominous lack of his former\u000aprotestations, and went quietly to the guard-house.
p7072
aVBut being\u000aneither an accomplished thinker nor an expert in moral theory, he did\u000anot reflect.
p7073
aVHe merely sat there and brooded.
p7074
aV"All I'm lookin' for\u000ais jus' a fayah show," he told himself, over and over again.
p7075
aV"He use\u000ame right, an' I'll use him right.
p7076
aVAin't I the bes' fightin' man in\u000athe regiment, ain't the Kuhnel done said so, a whole plainty o'\u000atimes?
p7077
aVWhen they's fightin', I'll be there.
p7078
aVBut that little\u000aLootenant--Lawszee, couldn' I smash him--all I want is jus' a\u000astraight deal."
p7079
aVFagan emerged at the end of his month still a child, but a sullen\u000achild now, moping over a bitter sense of injustice.
p7080
aV"I ain' nevah\u000agwine to stay in theah anothah night," he told his friend the\u000aSergeant.
p7081
aV"All I want is a fayah deal, an' I'll use ev'rybody\u000astraight.
p7082
aVBut no one ain't gwine to keep me in theah again."
p7083
aVThe\u000aSergeant, wise as most old soldiers, made no answer.
p7084
aVIf the\u000aLieutenant and Wild Fagan were to fight it out, it was no affair of\u000athe Sergeant's.
p7085
aVBut Fagan, over the drinks, repeated his ultimatum to other men, who\u000awaited joyously for the clash, and were surprised and disappointed\u000awhen Fagan went quietly to the guard-house once again, placed there\u000ato await the sitting of a general court martial.
p7086
aVThe quietness was\u000aonly because he was learning to plan.
p7087
aVWhen the silence of midnight\u000acame, he stole over to an inner window, braced a shoulder and a knee,\u000aand the rusted bars yielded noiselessly.
p7088
aVHe crept up-stairs to his\u000asquad-room and took the rifle and the belt, heavy with two hundred\u000arounds of ammunition, from the head of his bunk, and crept as\u000asilently down.
p7089
aVHe tried to steal by the guard at the gate, but the\u000aman turned and leveled his rifle, hardly six feet away.
p7090
aV"Halt!
p7091
aVWho goes theah?"
p7092
aVhe challenged, with the mechanical lilt of\u000athe sentry.
p7093
aV"You min' you' business, Sam, an' I'll ten' to mine," Fagan growled.
p7094
aVBut the man persisted, though with a tremor in his voice.
p7095
aV"Yo' halt,\u000aFagan.
p7096
aVAh've got to fin'--"\u000a\u000aFagan gripped his rifle by the muzzle, and stepped swiftly toward the\u000aleveled one.
p7097
aV"You git out o' heah, Sam," he ordered.
p7098
aV"Git, or I'll\u000asmash you."
p7099
aVThe sentry dropped his rifle.
p7100
aV"Ah ain' nevah troubled you all,\u000aFagan," he whined.
p7101
aV"Ah'm a frien' o' you all's.
p7102
aVYou lait me alone."
p7103
aVHe sank to his knees.
p7104
aV"You lait me alone.
p7105
aVDon' you touch me, don'\u000ayou touch--"  His voice rose to a shriek, but he was talking to empty\u000aair.
p7106
aVFagan had picked up the extra rifle and slipped away toward the\u000atown.
p7107
aV"Ah couldn' he'ep it, sah.
p7108
aVHe done come up out o' the dahk, with his\u000aeyes a buhnin', an' he sa-ays, 'Ah'll maash you, Sam.'
p7109
aVAh couldn'\u000ahe'ep mase'ef.
p7110
aVAh've seen him maash these yere Fillypeenos."
p7111
aVThus\u000athe sentry to the Lieutenant next morning, with heartfelt\u000aearnestness.
p7112
aV"Ah wouldn' cared if he was gwine to shoot, but he\u000acomes a grinnin', an' he sa-ays, 'Ah'll maash you, Sam.'
p7113
aVThat's what\u000ahe sa-ays, an' he'd a done it," he explained later, to a group of\u000asympathizing men.
p7114
aV"Ah don' min' gettin' shot, but Ah suah don'\u000awantah git maashed.
p7115
aVSo Ah dropped ma rifle.
p7116
aVAh've seen him maash\u000athese yere Fillypeenos.
p7117
aVHe ain' no man, he's a plumb bawn devil,\u000atha's what he is," and Sam wiped the sweat drops from his throat with\u000athe back of his big, shaking hand.
p7118
aVThen ensued many tentative pushings at the bars, to prove that no two\u000amere men could spring them back into position, and many side-long\u000aglances at Fagan's ownerless cot and the chest which stood beside it,\u000aclosed and mysterious.
p7119
aVWhen the men turned in, no one objected that\u000aSam placed a lighted candle on it.
p7120
aV"They don' come roun' wheah it's\u000alight," he explained vaguely to the room, and every one knew what\u000a"they" meant.
p7121
aVEven the old Sergeant, coming through at roll-call,\u000aapparently did not see the forbidden light.
p7122
aVAnd now the United States Army lapsed into a state of hysteria which\u000aoften amused and puzzled those who witnessed it.
p7123
aVIt became haunted\u000aby a big black man who mashed people instead of shooting them\u000adecently.
p7124
aVThere happened to be a recrudescence of fighting, and the\u000aArmy imputed it to Fagan.
p7125
aVThat stupid, brooding, grown-up child\u000abecame a tactician, a strategist, a second De Wet of guerilla warfare.
p7126
aV"I have the honor to report," wrote young Shavetail to the\u000aA.G.O.--through proper channels--"a sharp engagement wherein the\u000aenemy hindered the development of my flanking movement by--unusual\u000abrilliancy for native leaders--honor to suggest--deserter Fagan\u000arumored to be in vicinity."
p7127
aV"Scouts report," wired Major Oakleaf, "two hours' ride southeast of\u000acamp, huge negro.
p7128
aVRequest description renegade Fagan."
p7129
aV"We're out gunnin' fer that big buck nigger answers to the name of\u000aFagan," remarked Mountain Battery to Cavalry, borrowing back the\u000a"makings" and a match to boot.
p7130
aV"He's seen up back here in the\u000afoot-hills last night."
p7131
aV"Wire through this mornin'," jeered Signal Corps, overhearing,\u000a"reportin' him up Cagayan way.
p7132
aVAn' yesterday he was down in\u000aBatangas.
p7133
aVHe sure must hike light."
p7134
aV"Well, he's a lively nigger, from all I hear," said Cavalry\u000ajudicially.
p7135
aV"Some one'll likely get hurt 'fore they get him."
p7136
aV"He'll maybe get hurt a little bit himself, just a shade, if this old\u000agirl falls on him," laughed Mountain Battery, patting the nose of the\u000avicious little gun in the packsaddle.
p7137
aV"Ho' still, you old\u000amule-horse, you!
p7138
aVThink I'll stand for you kickin' me?"
p7139
aVSo the little armies marched and sweated, and the wires carried\u000abulletins to every little post: "Inform troops and natives--renegade\u000aFagan, deserter Fifty-fourth--very big black negro, age twenty-one,\u000alarge bolo scar on breast--five hundred dollars, gold, alive or dead."
p7140
aVAnd all the while Fagan was living quietly with the girl who had been\u000athe chief cause of all his insubordination, in a little mountain\u000avillage not fifty miles from the place where his ghost first rose and\u000acalled for lighted candles.
p7141
aVThe reports of his evil fame brought him no joy.
p7142
aV"Why can't they let\u000aus alone," he complained to Patricia.
p7143
aV"I never hurt them, and if\u000athey don't trouble us we won't trouble them.
p7144
aVEh, Pats?"
p7145
aVand he\u000aswept the slender girl up to his shoulder.
p7146
aV"Pooh," cried Patricia disdainfully, from her height.
p7147
aV"What do we\u000acare for them!
p7148
aVYou will kill them all, won't you?"
p7149
aVShe pinched the\u000agreat supporting arm with a sigh of satisfaction.
p7150
aV"Hola, there's\u000aEnrique's cock fighting with Juan's.
p7151
aVLet's go and watch them."
p7152
aVAnd\u000aas they walked down the narrow grassy street, the people stepped\u000aaside with cheerful smiles, for all the world like the dusty\u000apickaninnies on the levee when one of the heaven-born passes by.
p7153
aVFor a long time Fagan and Patricia lived on in the village, till the\u000aman was becoming a myth.
p7154
aVA dozen enterprising hunters had brought in\u000ahis head, and the papers in Manila had ceased to give circumstantial\u000aaccounts of his capture even when news was short.
p7155
aVBut at last an\u000aAmerican prisoner came to the town, the only white man who saw Fagan\u000aalive after his desertion.
p7156
aVBy a strange chance he was an officer of\u000athe Fifty-fourth, and Fagan received him with sober joy.
p7157
aV"I'se right glad to see you, Lootenant," he said.
p7158
aV"I raickoned\u000athey'd bring you up heah, when I hea'd you was done capchuhed.
p7159
aVThey\u000akind brings mos' ev'ything up to me, these days."
p7160
aVThe white man was not joyous, though undismayed.
p7161
aV"What are you going\u000ato do with me, now you've got me?"
p7162
aVhe demanded.
p7163
aV"Don' you worry, Lootenant," Fagan answered.
p7164
aV"I wouldn' huht you.
p7165
aVNo, sir, you nevah troubled me.
p7166
aVYou jus' set down an' have a smoke.
p7167
aVI'se a gwine to send you down, jus' as soon as I can."
p7168
aVThey sat and smoked in silence, the giant negro, the prisoner in his\u000adraggled uniform, the little brown guards with their naked bobs.
p7169
aVAt\u000alast Fagan said, "I raickon we could talk bettah if these yere guards\u000awas away.
p7170
aVYou git," he pointed to them.
p7171
aV"Course you give you' wohd,\u000aLootenant, you won't try to 'scape."
p7172
aVThe officer nodded, and fell to watching the great, quiet, unshapen\u000ablack face.
p7173
aVIt roused his curiosity for a certain non-offensive air\u000aof self-reliance which he had never seen in a black face before.
p7174
aV"Fagan," he asked suddenly, "why did you do it?"
p7175
aV"Do what, Lootenant?"
p7176
aV"Desert, and lead the natives against us, and all that."
p7177
aVThe negro clenched his great fist.
p7178
aV"This yere fool talk makes me\u000aplumb riled," he said.
p7179
aV"I ain' nevah fought the 'Mericans.
p7180
aVI'se a\u000a'Merican myse'f, ain't I?
p7181
aVAn' what would I want to go yampin' roun'\u000athe country for, anyway?
p7182
aVI'se got all I want right heah, chickens,\u000aan' yams, an' a good dry house, an'--"  He reached out his hand and\u000agrasped Patricia's little one, and they smiled at each other.
p7183
aV"No,\u000asir, I don' want no moah fightin'.
p7184
aVI'se got a good home, an' I goes\u000ato sleep when I wants to, an' I gits up when I wants to, an' I has\u000aclean clo'es ev'y day.
p7185
aVYou tell the Kuhnel, Lootenant, you tell him\u000aFagan nevah went to huht no 'Mericans, an' nevah will, less'n they\u000agoes to huht me first.
p7186
aVYou believe that, don' you, Lootenant?"
p7187
aVAnd\u000athe officer gravely nodded "Yes."
p7188
aV"Bout that desertin', now.
p7189
aVI'se thought a whole lot about that, an'\u000aI raickon I done it jus' because I had to have mo' room.
p7190
aVI'se some\u000abig, I raickon--" he let his eyes travel slowly down his body and\u000achuckled--"seems like I has to have a whole plainty o' room.
p7191
aVSeems\u000alike they wahn't room fo' me an' Lootenant Sha'ap in one ahmy.
p7192
aVNo,\u000asir.
p7193
aVAn' then, I dunno, Lootenant, maybe you nevah felt how a woman\u000acan make you 'shamed of youse'f?
p7194
aVThis Patricia lady, maybe she don'\u000aseem like much to you, but she's a heap to me--yes, sir,--an' she\u000akep' sayin', 'What for you go calabozo, Fagan?
p7195
aVKill the little pig\u000aof a teniente,' she says.
p7196
aV'Kill ev'rybody.
p7197
aVYou'se big enough.'
p7198
aVAn'\u000athen she laughs at me.
p7199
aV'Is you 'fraid, big man?'
p7200
aVshe says.
p7201
aV'Lend me\u000ayouah revolvah, then.
p7202
aVI'se little, but I ain't afraid.'
p7203
aVShe jus'\u000amade me plumb scairt of myse'f, an' we come away, 'cause Pats an' me\u000aneeded more room 'n what Lootenant Sha'ap could give us.
p7204
aV'Pears like\u000ayou couldn' understan' it, but that's the way it was, I raickon.
p7205
aVI\u000ajus' had to desert or huht somebody bad."
p7206
aVHe stopped, and the woman began to speak to him.
p7207
aVThe white man\u000awatched her, and a great light burst upon him.
p7208
aVShe was glorious,\u000athis slim, soft brown thing with the dusky hair and the straight,\u000aslender neck, and--"I'se little, but I ain't afraid."
p7209
aVAges of\u000acivilization dropped from the man as he gazed, and with a graceless\u000apity he compared the pale fettered women he had known with this free,\u000awild, perfect thing whose feeling was her life.
p7210
aVShe was talking with\u000aher tongue and eyes and hands, and Fagan answered a few words and\u000alaughed, and she laughed, too, a sound as natural and sweet as the\u000aripple of a stream, and then her great eyes lighted with earnestness\u000aas she went on.
p7211
aVThe Lieutenant felt a pang of something almost\u000ajealousy.
p7212
aVHe could never bring fire to those eyes, he was not a man\u000ato her, only a thing, not to be compared with that black giant.
p7213
aVFagan turned to him with an amused chuckle.
p7214
aV"She's full o' ginger,"\u000ahe said.
p7215
aV"I raickon it's lucky I was heah when you come.
p7216
aVShe's jus'\u000abeen askin' when I was goin' to kill you.
p7217
aV'You must,' she says, 'or\u000aelse he'll lead soldiers up heah.'
p7218
aVThat's all right, Lootenant," he\u000asaid, as the officer moved uneasily.
p7219
aV"That's you' duty, an' it's all\u000aright, only she don' understand that.
p7220
aV'Le's kill him now,' she says.
p7221
aV'You keep a talkin' with him, an' I'll put the knife into him from\u000abehin'.
p7222
aVIt won' be no trouble at all.'
p7223
aVLawszee," he chuckled\u000aadmiringly, "I raickon she'd a done it, too.
p7224
aVShe's got moah ginger!"
p7225
aVThe Lieutenant smiled with him, but he soon rose, unobtrusively, and\u000aseated himself with his back to the solid corner-post of the house.
p7226
aVPatricia watched the manoeuvre with unfathomable eyes, and the men\u000aburst into laughter; then she hung her head like a child caught in\u000asome mischief.
p7227
aVThe gesture was adorable, and suddenly sadness\u000astifled the white man's laughter.
p7228
aV"I'm sorry about reporting your presence here," he said.
p7229
aV"I\u000aunderstand, I think, and I believe you don't want to make trouble,\u000abut--"\u000a\u000a"Don' you worry about that," Fagan broke in.
p7230
aV"I'se a gwine to send\u000ayou down to the ra'alroad this afternoon.
p7231
aVAn' now Pats's goin' to\u000aget you some dinner."
p7232
aV"Fagan," said the Lieutenant, yet more earnestly, while his guard\u000awaited for him to mount, "I'm right sorry about this.
p7233
aVBut--why don't\u000ayou come down with me now and surrender?"
p7234
aVhe asked impulsively.
p7235
aV"That will help, and I can explain some things to the court, and\u000ayou'll only get six months or so, for desertion.
p7236
aVOnly six months,\u000aand then--you can come back to Patricia," he ended almost enviously.
p7237
aVThe negro seemed to swell before the white man's astonished eyes.
p7238
aV"I'se sorry, too.
p7239
aVIt's been mighty pleasant, livin' heah," he said\u000asimply.
p7240
aV"An' thank you fer askin' me to come down.
p7241
aVI know you means\u000ait straight.
p7242
aVBut you can't see it like I do.
p7243
aVDown theah I'se a\u000aniggah soldier.
p7244
aVUp heah I'se--  Nobody ain't got any right to try\u000ame," he burst out.
p7245
aV"I nevah troubled _them_.
p7246
aVYou tell the Kuhnel\u000athat, I want he should understan'.
p7247
aVI don' want to huht no one, but\u000aI'se nevah gwine into no gahd-house again.
p7248
aVGood-by, Lootenant, an'\u000aluck.
p7249
aVI don' raickon we all'll evah meet up again."
p7250
aV[Illustration: _Fagan and Patricia_.]
p7251
aVSo Fagan and Patricia must needs leave the snug little house at the\u000aend of the sleepy, grass-grown street, and go out on the High Trail,\u000athe unknown of the people of the plains, a broad highway to things\u000awith hoofs and claws and wings, and to men little less wild than\u000athey, the men of the hills.
p7252
aVAt times the brown thread of the Trail\u000awas twined amid the giant roots of trees, and they wandered in a cool\u000atwilight, alone with the long creepers and the ferns and the bright\u000abirds which played about some opening in the matted roof, far above\u000atheir heads, where the sun dropped through for a brief hour.
p7253
aVSometimes it clung to the massive walls of a caon, where a river\u000aboiled so far below that the sound of its torment came to their ears\u000alike the babble of a brook.
p7254
aVSometimes it shot upward to the realm of\u000athe clouds, and from the bare, grassy heights they peered out through\u000ashifting mist wreaths over all the cities and fields of the plains to\u000athe blue hint of the distant sea.
p7255
aVFagan and Patricia followed the Trail steadily but leisurely, day\u000aafter day.
p7256
aVThere was no call for haste, no white pursuer knew that\u000aroad.
p7257
aVSo they laughed and played, and lay for hours beside some cool\u000aspring, basking in the warm sunshine and the thin, sharp air, and\u000acamped at night in little valleys under a pall of cloud.
p7258
aVOnce Fagan\u000ashot a deer, and they delayed for days, drying the meat over pungent\u000awood-smoke.
p7259
aVBut as their muscles hardened to the Trail, they\u000ainsensibly made greater progress, in spite of their dallying.
p7260
aVTwo weeks brought them to the land of the Unknown, had they but known\u000ait.
p7261
aVThe mountains were higher and wilder, the cloud-caps more\u000afrequent.
p7262
aVOften the forest on some huge hill, towering black above\u000athe Trail, was thin and pointed at the top, as if it had been torn,\u000aand there, unseen of them, was a village perched high on the trunks\u000aof trees, whence keen-eyed men watched their progress.
p7263
aVBut they were\u000achildren of the plains and could not know, so they walked undismayed.
p7264
aVAnd the keen-eyed men walked with them, unseen, frisking along above\u000athem over ground where others would have crept--short, huge-limbed\u000amen, whose stiff black hair flowed over their shoulders, and was tied\u000aout of their eyes with fillets, men who squatted naked in the mists\u000aof evening and did not shiver, men who brought their sweethearts\u000ahideous dowries of human heads.
p7265
aVThey hung about the Trail, watching\u000athese strange creatures who walked openly and undismayed in the land\u000aof Fear.
p7266
aVOften, when the camp-fire was lighted, they stole up with\u000atheir muscles twitching like a cat's before she springs, and then\u000ahalted as a great voice rang over the forest--"I'se been wo'okin' on\u000athe ra'alroad"--and they clawed their way up the slopes to the\u000along-legged villages, and took counsel together in the queer\u000afire-shadows.
p7267
aVOne evening as they camped, Patricia missed a little bundle of\u000avenison and strolled back along the Trail to look for it.
p7268
aVFagan\u000akindled the fire and then strolled back, too.
p7269
aV"Hoy, Pats," he\u000acalled.
p7270
aVThe forest was silent.
p7271
aVHe turned a bend in the Trail, and\u000athere--Fagan gazed at it stupidly.
p7272
aVThen the blind impulse of wrath\u000aswept over him again.
p7273
aVBut there was naught to strike.
p7274
aVThe long\u000ashadows of the trees lay across the Trail, the creepers swayed lazily\u000ain the evening breeze; far up, a crow called petulantly to her\u000abelated mate.
p7275
aVFagan swung his arm helplessly at the forest.
p7276
aV"Come out," he moaned, "come out wheah I can see you.
p7277
aVCome out, you\u000acowards, you sneakin' dogs that kills women from behind.
p7278
aVI'se not\u000aafraid of you.
p7279
aVOh, I'll mash _you_!
p7280
aVCome!"
p7281
aVWith a soft chug, a\u000alance stuck quivering in the tree beside him.
p7282
aVOtherwise all was\u000asilent; even the crow had ceased to scold.
p7283
aVHe looked down.
p7284
aVA darker\u000ashadow was stealing among the lengthening ones on the Trail.
p7285
aVThe\u000aspirit of the forest gripped Fagan with an icy hand, the spirit of\u000aDread.
p7286
aVHe ran blindly to the fire, seized his rifle, and took up the\u000aTrail alone.
p7287
aVFor three days and nights he hurried on.
p7288
aVThe empty pain of his\u000astomach, the dizzying, numbing lack of sleep, could not hold him\u000aagainst the dread of his unseen escort.
p7289
aVIt gave little sign, simply\u000athe rustling of a fern now and then, the swaying of one creeper when\u000aothers were still, but he felt its presence and staggered on.
p7290
aVOn the\u000aevening of the third day, he stepped suddenly from the forest into a\u000alittle theatre among the hills.
p7291
aVA clear brook bubbled over golden\u000agravel; the turf beneath a great solitary tree was thick and soft.
p7292
aVWild cocks in the wood were crowing their families to roost.
p7293
aVEverything was quiet and peaceful, and Fagan, as he gazed, became\u000apeaceful and quiet, too.
p7294
aVHe flung himself on the soft turf, and\u000adrank his fill from the little brook.
p7295
aVAs always, when he sought to\u000arest, the forest became vague with life.
p7296
aVA covey of jungle-fowl,\u000aflushed by a sudden fright, whirred across the opening.
p7297
aVA stone\u000arolled somewhere close at hand, dislodged by a purposely careless\u000afoot.
p7298
aVBut this time Fagan merely grinned, and shook off his clinging\u000acartridge-belt.
p7299
aV"You can' bluff me no moah," he said to the forest,\u000aa trick he had learned of late.
p7300
aVA fern swayed not a dozen yards\u000aaway, and he clicked a cartridge into his Krag and fired.
p7301
aV"You git\u000aout," he chuckled.
p7302
aV"I'se a gittin' tired of you' company."
p7303
aVWhen he was rested a little, he kindled a fire and toasted a bit of\u000avenison.
p7304
aVThen he lay back lazily and twisted his last bit of tobacco\u000ainto a cigarette.
p7305
aVBetween puffs he bellowed his evening song, and\u000athe rude melody took on the sweetness of a ballad.
p7306
aV"Don' you heah\u000athe bugle callin'?"
p7307
aVFagan sang, and tossed the butt of the cigarette\u000ainto the fire.
p7308
aVIt was quite dark now in the hollow, and he sat in a\u000alittle circle of dancing light.
p7309
aVHe looked at the wall of blackness\u000awith quiet, unfrightened eyes that presently began to close with the\u000apressure of a mighty drowsiness.
p7310
aV"I'se po'owful sleepy now," he announced at length, "an' I'se a gwine\u000ato bed.
p7311
aVI was hopin' to set up an' meet some of you all, but I can't\u000ado it.
p7312
aVWhen you all wants me, you all can wake me up."
p7313
aVThe fire\u000aflickered, and he pillowed his head on his arm, and watched the dance\u000aof the shadows grow shorter.
p7314
aV"Lawszee," he murmured, drowsily, as\u000athe great numbness of sleep overcame him, "I raickon Patricia'd think\u000aI was scairt again.
p7315
aVShe'd a sat up an' waited foh them, but I can't.
p7316
aVThat little girl did have the po'owf'les' lot o' ginger in her."
p7317
aVHe\u000athrew his great arm protectingly over the empty ground beside him.
p7318
aV"Good night, Pats," he murmured.
p7319
aVIn that well-remembered town among the paddies, a squat and naked\u000aman, huge-muscled, came out of the door of the quarters.
p7320
aVIn his hand\u000ahe carried a broad-bladed spear.
p7321
aVA head-axe, bright as only\u000aspeckless steel can be in sunlight, flashed in his girdle.
p7322
aVAnd at\u000ahis back a bag, plumply round, bobbed heavily, and as it bobbed it\u000agave out a dull jingle, as of coined metal.
p7323
aV"Got his money, all right," said one of the group that watched him.
p7324
aVThe savage halted, and grinned widely at each in turn.
p7325
aV"Me got," he\u000aannounced proudly.
p7326
aV"_Mucho dinero_.
p7327
aV_Mucho mucho dinero_.
p7328
aVMe got."
p7329
aVHe could scarcely contain his joy.
p7330
aVOne of the watchers growled.
p7331
aV"I'm not in favior," said he, "of\u000apayin' gu-gus for killin' white men, no matter whether they're white\u000aor black.
p7332
aVIt's a catchin' habit."
p7333
aVIt was the judicial soldier.
p7334
aVHe\u000aswung his lean bulk toward the grinning little man.
p7335
aV"Now you've got\u000ait," he commanded, "git!"
p7336
aVThe savage, half-comprehending, turned and passed down the path they\u000aopened for him, and down the sun-beaten, dusty street, where the\u000asilent people fell away before him as if he carried pestilence.
p7337
aVAnd\u000aso they saw the last of him, making for those distant, cloud-hung\u000ahills of his, moving clumsily but swiftly across the paddies at his\u000ashuffling trot, while the price of a man's rebellion bobbed, and\u000ajingled dully at his back.
p7338
aVCHAPTER II\u000a\u000aGOD'S LITTLE DEVILS\u000a\u000aI was back in that ancient temple of Tzin Piau.
p7339
aVMy old heathen\u000apriest, half reclining on his hollowed slab of stone, was looking at\u000ame with a spark of laughter in his keen old eyes.
p7340
aV"Have you seen for yourself?"
p7341
aVhe asked.
p7342
aVI nodded.
p7343
aV"And how," he asked me, "do you like to look at the Games of the\u000aLittle Gods?"
p7344
aV"I think," said I angrily, "that they are Little Devils.
p7345
aVThat black\u000aman was a man.
p7346
aVIf they had given him half a chance--"\u000a\u000a"Remember," said my heathen friend, quite calmly, "that I do not know\u000ayour black man, or what they did to him.
p7347
aVSomething unpleasant, it\u000aappears.
p7348
aVIt does not matter.
p7349
aVIt is in the Game.
p7350
aVBut you think my\u000aLittle Gods are Little Devils?"
p7351
aV"I do," I said.
p7352
aV"I wonder," mused my heathen priest, smiling through me into vacancy,\u000a"what he would think of Little Devils if he saw them."
p7353
aVSuddenly his\u000aeyes glinted into mine.
p7354
aVHe made a little imperative gesture with his\u000ahand.
p7355
aV"Go and see," he said.
p7356
aV"This is the hour when I take another\u000anap.
p7357
aVAnd would you mind," he added, "as you're going out, just\u000aasking the porter to bring a jug of water?"
p7358
aVThat night, when rice was eaten and the circle of darkness had shut\u000adown about our fire, Fermin Majusay, the private of Native Scouts who\u000awas my escort on the mountain, stretched out on his slim stomach and\u000agazed into the hypnotic flames.
p7359
aV"I am going to tell you about my teniente," he said suddenly, "my\u000alieutenant who is dead six months.
p7360
aVHe was a devil, that man.
p7361
aVListen!
p7362
aVYou have sat in the Caf Puerta del Sol and watched the two\u000aold Spaniards who play forever the game called chess?
p7363
aVWell, when the\u000alittle man of Don Antonio gets in front of the little horse of Don\u000aJos, does Don Jos say, 'Bad little man, go to another little\u000asquare'?
p7364
aVNo, he says 'Muerto!'--'Dead!'
p7365
aV--and takes the little man\u000aaway.
p7366
aVThat is the game, to take all the little men off the board,\u000aand it is just the same with fighting.
p7367
aVBut all the white men I have\u000aseen, except my teniente, were afraid of the end.
p7368
aVMy teniente always\u000alaughed when the end came.
p7369
aVHe was born to be a soldier, like me.
p7370
aV"I remember how he laughed at Don Augusto.
p7371
aVWe were in a very bad\u000aprovince then.
p7372
aVAll the provinces are a little bad; that is why they\u000asent me to take care of you, because the mountains are not safe for a\u000awhite man.
p7373
aVBut that was an island in the south, and it was very bad.
p7374
aVAll the middle of it was mountains where ladrones lived, and they\u000acame down to the coast and made people give them food and money, and\u000athey stole carabaos from the plantations and killed travelers, and\u000asometimes they burned a town and took the pretty girls away.
p7375
aV"We were sent there to catch them.
p7376
aVIt was very hard work.
p7377
aVWe chased\u000athem in the mountains and killed some, but that did no good.
p7378
aVWhen we\u000awere in one place they were somewhere else, and when a man guided us\u000ain a little while he was dead.
p7379
aVWe knew what was the matter.
p7380
aVIt is\u000aalways the same.
p7381
aVThe ladrones are in the mountains, but some man in\u000athe towns is their leader, and he gets so rich and strong that every\u000aone is afraid of him.
p7382
aVIn that island it was a planter named Augusto\u000ade los Reyes.
p7383
aVThree times my lieutenant arrested Augusto de los\u000aReyes and sent him down to San Pablo; and every time the judge said\u000athere was no proof and he came back, and in a little while all the\u000awitnesses against him were dead.
p7384
aVAnd the ladrones in the mountains\u000aalways knew when we were coming.
p7385
aV"If my teniente had been like other white men, he would have given up\u000athen.
p7386
aVBut he arrested Don Augusto once more.
p7387
aVI remember the morning\u000avery well.
p7388
aVI was orderly that day, and we were in the guard-room\u000alooking at some prisoners, and a guard came in, two in front and two\u000abehind, with this Don Augusto.
p7389
aVHe was a big, fat Bisayan, and we all\u000alooked at him, and he looked at us, and smiled.
p7390
aVThen we didn't feel\u000avery good, for we knew what he'd like to do to us.
p7391
aV"But my teniente laughed when he saw him.
p7392
aVHe stood up and shook\u000ahands with Don Augusto, and he said: '_Buenos dias_, Seor Don\u000aAugusto de los Reyes.'
p7393
aVLike that, making fun.
p7394
aV'It is not very long\u000asince we met,' he said, 'but I am very glad to see you again.
p7395
aVI\u000atrust you found the prison at San Pablo pleasant?'
p7396
aV"This Don Augusto knew how to play the game, too.
p7397
aVHe smiled with his\u000amouth and said: 'It is not bad, Seor Teniente.
p7398
aVBut it grows\u000atiresome to have the comedy of going there repeated so often.
p7399
aVThe\u000ajudge gets tired, too, deciding that I am not such a bad man as my\u000afriend the teniente would have him think.'
p7400
aV"My teniente laughed again.
p7401
aV'These judges!'
p7402
aVhe said.
p7403
aV'If only they\u000acould see us as we are, Seor Don Augusto de los Reyes.
p7404
aVIt is so\u000ahard to make them understand.'
p7405
aVThen he stopped smiling, and talked\u000avery slow, more as if he talked to himself.
p7406
aV'I could send him down\u000ato San Pablo again, and I could say to the judge, "Seor Juez, this\u000ais the Seor Don Augusto de los Reyes whom the Swiss Bobin accused of\u000agiving information to the enemy, so that he lay in San Pablo jail for\u000athree weeks, till you said there was no proof."
p7407
aVAnd I could say to\u000athe judge: "Last week this innocent gentleman came back from his\u000atrial, and last Sunday, as the Swiss Bobin rode on a narrow trail,\u000afour men attacked him and cut off his hand as he drew his revolver,\u000aand then killed him."
p7408
aVBut what would that amount to?'
p7409
aV"'Very little,' said Don Augusto.
p7410
aV"'Nothing,' said my teniente.
p7411
aV'And I could tell the judge: "That\u000aSunday night men came to the house of the late Swiss Bobin and took\u000ahis woman away, and her muchacha found her next morning staked by the\u000afour hands and feet to an ant-hill."
p7412
aVBut that would be no charge\u000aagainst the Seor Don Augusto de los Reyes.'
p7413
aV"'Precisely,' said Don Augusto, and he smiled.
p7414
aVOh, he was a big,\u000aproud man, and he knew what he could do so well that he did not\u000apretend not to know.
p7415
aV"'Precisely,' said my teniente.
p7416
aV'And I could tell the judge: "The\u000atwo weeks' baby of the late widow of the late Swiss Bobin died that\u000aMonday afternoon, so to-day there is not a soul alive of the family\u000aof the man who charged an innocent gentleman unjustly, as you\u000ayourself decided, Seor Juez."
p7417
aV"Don Augusto smiled and was going to speak, but my teniente only\u000amoved his hand and went on, and all of us soldiers in the guard-room\u000aheld our breaths and listened, for we knew that he spoke the truth.
p7418
aV'We could tell the judge: "The four men who killed the man and the\u000awoman and left the baby to starve live on the plantation of the\u000aprisoner and owe him much money."
p7419
aVBut what does that prove?
p7420
aVEven if\u000awe tell him that all the enemies of the Seor Don Augusto de los\u000aReyes for twenty years have gone that way, and that no one any more\u000adares to be a witness against him for fear of his revenge, the judge\u000awill not care about that.
p7421
aVThe judge wants proof, and we have no\u000aproof.
p7422
aVNo matter how well we know each other, we have no proof.
p7423
aVSo\u000aI shall not send my dear friend down to jail again.
p7424
aVI am tired of\u000ait, too.'
p7425
aV"All we soldiers looked at the ground, for we thought our teniente\u000awas a fool, like the judge, and would let Don Augusto go again.
p7426
aVAnd\u000aDon Augusto looked at us as if we were dogs--I wanted to give him my\u000abayonet--and he smiled and said: 'I thank you so much, Teniente mio,\u000afor sparing me another of the comedies.
p7427
aVIt is better for every one.
p7428
aV_Adis_, Seor.'
p7429
aV"Oh, I told you that teniente of mine was a devil!
p7430
aVHe got up and\u000ashook the hand of Don Augusto, and he smiled and said: '_Adis_,\u000aSeor Don Augusto de los Reyes.
p7431
aVWe shall not meet again for some\u000atime, I think.
p7432
aVI am getting very tired of it myself.
p7433
aVBut I will\u000agive you a trustworthy escort.
p7434
aVJos!'
p7435
aV[Illustration: "_Adis, Seor Don Augusto_."]
p7436
aV"We all jumped, his voice was so different, and the corporal of my\u000asquad stepped out and saluted.
p7437
aV'You will be the Seor's escort as\u000afar as he goes,' my teniente said.
p7438
aV'You will need only your\u000arevolver.'
p7439
aVHe stopped a moment, and then he said: 'Jos, you must be\u000avery careful that he does not escape.'
p7440
aV"You know what that order meant then?
p7441
aVJos knew, and his face went\u000alike ashes--he was a baby anyway--and he could hardly say 'Si, mi\u000ateniente.'
p7442
aVAnd that big fat pig of a Don Augusto, _he_ knew, and he\u000adropped all together, as if he had no bones, and he went down on his\u000aknees.
p7443
aVBut my teniente only laughed, and said: 'A pleasant journey\u000ato you, Seor Don Augusto de los Reyes, and a relief from comedies.'
p7444
aV"And then he took the commissary reports and wrote on them till Jos\u000acame back.
p7445
aVJos was shaking and green and my teniente looked at him.
p7446
aV'You are back quickly,' he said.
p7447
aV'What is the matter?'
p7448
aV"'The prisoner tried to escape, mi teniente,' Jos said.
p7449
aV"'That was very foolish of him,' said my teniente.
p7450
aV'Where is he now?'
p7451
aV"'Across the river, mi teniente,' Jos answered.
p7452
aV"'Sergeant,' said my lieutenant, 'send two men across the river with\u000ashovels,' and then he tossed Jos a _peseta_ to buy _vino_, and then\u000ahe went on with the commissary reports."
p7453
aVFermin Majusay had forgotten everything else in thinking of his hero,\u000aand the fire was almost out.
p7454
aVHe brought it to a blaze and lay down\u000aon his blanket again.
p7455
aV"That night while we whispered together in\u000abarracks, and that chicken-hearted Jos sat by himself and muttered\u000aprayers and drank vino out of his bottle, we named our teniente El\u000aDiablito--the Little Devil.
p7456
aVNot because he was little, but because\u000awe loved him.
p7457
aVYou know Angel Bantiling calls his wife Chiquita--Tiny\u000aOne--and she is big as a carabao.
p7458
aVEl Diablito, I named my teniente,\u000aand we were afraid.
p7459
aVIf he had come down-stairs that night, we would\u000aall have run away.
p7460
aVBut what would you have?
p7461
aVThat Don Augusto was in\u000athe way, so my teniente took him off the board just like one of Don\u000aAntonio's little men of chewed bread.
p7462
aVThat is the game.
p7463
aVIf one is\u000aafraid of it, there are other games one can play.
p7464
aVOne does not have\u000ato be a soldier.
p7465
aVBut he made us afraid, just the same.
p7466
aV"After Don Augusto was dead, all that part of the province was good,\u000aso they sent us to another part.
p7467
aVBarang was the name of the town\u000awhere we went.
p7468
aVIt was a better town; the people were good; we had\u000anothing to do but drill.
p7469
aVAnd after drill, often, my teniente took me\u000ato shoot with him.
p7470
aVI would hold an empty bottle for beer in my hand,\u000alike that, and my teniente would shoot it from twenty paces with his\u000arevolver.
p7471
aVHoy, he was a devil at everything, my teniente!
p7472
aVHundreds\u000aand hundreds we broke, and he never hurt me.
p7473
aVAnd he took me to be\u000ahis servant in his quarters, and I was very happy, there in Barang."
p7474
aVFermin Majusay gazed into the fire again, and his keen animal face\u000awas wonderfully softened in the flickering light.
p7475
aV"_Dis_," he sighed, "I was happy, there in Barang!
p7476
aVOnly one thing I\u000adid not like,--that was Isidro Abelarde.
p7477
aVHe was the leader of the\u000atown, the son of a very rich _haciendero_, young and handsome.
p7478
aVAnd\u000ahe became the friend of my teniente.
p7479
aVThey would laugh and talk\u000atogether for hours, and ride together, and I did not like it.
p7480
aVWe\u000aMacabebes have many enemies--all the Filipinos are our enemies--and\u000awe have to be suspicious always.
p7481
aVI began to wonder why Isidro\u000aAbelarde wanted to be with my lieutenant.
p7482
aV'Mi teniente,' I said to\u000ahim, 'I do not like it that Don Isidro comes here.
p7483
aVIt is not good\u000athat he can pass the guard at any time, as if he were a white man.
p7484
aVIf he means harm--'\u000a\u000a"My teniente laughed.
p7485
aV'You are more bother than a wife, Fermin,' he\u000asaid.
p7486
aV'Why should he mean harm to me?'
p7487
aV"'He is the _pariente_--the relative--of Don Augusto,' I said.
p7488
aVMy\u000ateniente looked at me, and I saw that he did not like to hear the\u000aname of Don Augusto.
p7489
aVFor a minute I was frightened--he had terrible\u000aeyes when he was angry.
p7490
aV'How do you know that?'
p7491
aVhe asked me.
p7492
aV"I would not tell him--we have ways of knowing things--and he got\u000aangrier, and struck me.
p7493
aVIt made my eye black, but I did not care.
p7494
aVHe was my teniente, any way, and he had been drinking.
p7495
aVNext day I\u000awas glad of it, for Don Isidro came to dinner, and he looked at my\u000aeye.
p7496
aVOften, when he thought no one saw him, he looked at it.
p7497
aVThen I\u000ahad an idea.
p7498
aVMy teniente was very short with me, because he was\u000asorry, and Don Isidro was so young it was not hard to make him think\u000athat I was angry with my teniente.
p7499
aVI scowled at him all the time\u000abehind his back; you know how.
p7500
aV"After a few days Don Isidro met me in the _plaza_ and said: 'Fermin,\u000aI am very sorry that the teniente struck you.'
p7501
aV"'Why are you sorry, Seor?'
p7502
aVI asked him.
p7503
aV"'Because,' he said, 'the teniente is a friend of mine, and I hope\u000athat no harm will come to him.
p7504
aVI have heard that a Macabebe never\u000aforgives a blow, but I hope you will be patient.'
p7505
aV"What a fool that young Isidro was!
p7506
aVI looked very hard in his eyes,\u000aand I said, 'If a Macabebe forgives a blow as easily as a Bisayan\u000aforgets the death of his _pariente_, there is no danger for your\u000afriend--from me.'
p7507
aV"He looked at me, and all at once his lips twitched, and I knew I had\u000ahim.
p7508
aVHe put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a little paper.
p7509
aV'Fermin,' he said, 'there is a sleeping-powder.
p7510
aVThe teniente will\u000anot strike you again if you do not wish it.'
p7511
aV"That young fool knew nothing at all, like a baby!
p7512
aVI took the paper\u000ahome and my teniente and I gave some of it to a monkey.
p7513
aVThe monkey\u000acurled up and died, very quick.
p7514
aVThat was at night, and my teniente\u000astood for a while and looked at the dead monkey and the paper.
p7515
aVAnd\u000ahe laughed just the way he did the morning the guard led in Don\u000aAugusto.
p7516
aV"Next morning I was putting the breakfast on the table, and my\u000ateniente was standing at the window of the sola, looking down at the\u000a_plaza_.
p7517
aVAnd all at once I heard him laugh, not very loud, and he\u000acalled: 'Hoy, Don Isidro!
p7518
aVHave the complacency to come up, amigo.
p7519
aVI\u000ahave news for you.'
p7520
aVAnd soon Don Isidro came up.
p7521
aV"Jesus Maria, he was a _pisaverde_ that morning!
p7522
aVWhite coat and\u000abreeches, and high boots of black leather, and silver spurs, and long\u000agloves of soft white leather.
p7523
aV"'Have the good-heartedness to share my poor breakfast,' my teniente\u000asaid, and Don Isidro sat down, and they ate till I had no patience\u000aleft.
p7524
aVBut at last Don Isidro pushed away his plate and leaned back\u000ain his chair and said, 'Now, teniente mio, what is this wonderful\u000anews?'
p7525
aV"My teniente pushed back his chair and offered his cigarette-case to\u000aDon Isidro.
p7526
aV'Take a long one, I beg,' he said.
p7527
aV"So Don Isidro selected an _entrelargos_, and I held a match for him,\u000aand then he smiled at my teniente through the smoke, and said: 'Our\u000anews, _amigo mio_.
p7528
aVI die of suspense.'
p7529
aV"My teniente put the little packet which Don Isidro had given me on\u000athe table, and he looked at Don Isidro.
p7530
aVI think the young fool knew\u000athen that the game was finished.
p7531
aVBut he was a brave one, I will say\u000athat, if he was a fool.
p7532
aVHe looked at the packet, and he looked at\u000athe teniente, and he looked at me and said, 'Traitor!'
p7533
aV"'As you were, Fermin,' my teniente commanded me.
p7534
aV'Let me urge you\u000aas a friend, Don Isidro, to smoke slowly and without excitement, for\u000awhen that cigarette is finished you will be finished.'
p7535
aV"Don Isidro's hand trembled a little, but he was not afraid.
p7536
aV'My\u000acompliments, Seor Teniente,' he said.
p7537
aV'You win again.
p7538
aVHave our\u000atraitor bring a little water, and when I am done smoking I will take\u000athe sleeping-powder.'
p7539
aV"'I am sorry,' said my teniente, 'but a monkey ate it.
p7540
aVAnd it would\u000abe unlawful to help you to commit suicide, anyway.
p7541
aVFermin, tell\u000aRaymundo to buckle on his revolver and be ready to escort Don Isidro\u000adown to--San Pablo.'
p7542
aV"'_Dispensa_, mi teniente,' I said.
p7543
aV'Does one ask a Macabebe to kill\u000ahis officer, and call him a traitor, for nothing?'
p7544
aV"My teniente looked at me, and laughed.
p7545
aV'Get your own revolver then,\u000aFermin,' he said.
p7546
aV"When I came back, Don Isidro's cigarette was very short.
p7547
aVThey both\u000astood up, and my teniente said: '_Adios_, Don Isidro.
p7548
aVAn easy\u000ajourney to you in Fermin's friendly company, and a welcome in--San\u000aPablo.
p7549
aVRemember me particularly to your _pariente_, Don Augusto.
p7550
aVI\u000aneed not tell _you_, Fermin, that you must be very careful that he\u000adoes not escape.'
p7551
aV"'I will be very careful, mi teniente,' I said, and we went away, and\u000amy teniente never knew that I made Don Isidro carry along a spade I\u000asaw in the guard-room.
p7552
aVOne does not call a Macabebe a traitor for\u000anothing....
p7553
aVThere is no more wood, and it gets late and cold.
p7554
aVShall\u000awe sleep, or will you hear the rest of my story while our fire dies?
p7555
aV"_Bueno_.
p7556
aVI will not be long.
p7557
aVSome of this story got out, not much,\u000afor only I and my teniente knew it all, but it frightened the other\u000aAmericans, and they said my teniente was crazy.
p7558
aV_Sangre de Dis_!
p7559
aVHe was not crazy then, but only one of God's own little devils.
p7560
aVHe\u000awas crazy afterwards, perhaps, but they made him so.
p7561
aVListen while I\u000atell you what they did to him.
p7562
aV"There is a little place very far back in the hills, Santo Spirito\u000athey call it, where the _frailes_ used to go for a retreat.
p7563
aVThere is\u000anothing there, just a big convent of stone where no one lives, and a\u000afew little dirty houses, and the mountains behind, and the jungle all\u000aaround, and the only people are lazy Bisayanos who do no work and are\u000ahalf drunk with opium.
p7564
aVAnd they sent my teniente there to eat his\u000aheart!
p7565
aV"Oh, he was brave!
p7566
aVHe was very brave, but there was nothing to do.
p7567
aVThat's why they sent us there; they knew we could do no harm.
p7568
aVThe\u000amountain was empty, and there was no one in the jungle, and the\u000apeople of Santo Spirito were too lazy to be bad.
p7569
aVBut he was brave;\u000ahe made work.
p7570
aVWe drilled long every day, and we made a parade-ground\u000aof the _plaza_ in front of the convent, with culverts of concrete at\u000athe corners to carry off the water in the rainy season.
p7571
aVThat took\u000amany hours.
p7572
aVBut always there was the evening coming, when my\u000ateniente had to sit in the big _sola_, with the rats and the lizards\u000asquealing above him, and drink and drink and drink, and wait for the\u000atime when he could sleep.
p7573
aV"Hoy, that drinking!
p7574
aVIt frightened me, and I spoke to him about it.
p7575
aVI could always speak to him, until the very end.
p7576
aVHe laughed at me.
p7577
aV'Give me something else to do, then,' he said.
p7578
aV'Shall I go and say a\u000amass in the chapel?'
p7579
aV"So he would sit and drink aguardiente for hours, and look at his\u000aboots.
p7580
aVSometimes he would be like himself for a little while, and\u000athen he would go for a ride, or shoot some bottles from my hand.
p7581
aVBut\u000anot for long.
p7582
aVOne day his hand was not steady, and he shot too\u000aclose--A, mi teniente!
p7583
aVHe just dropped the revolver on the ground\u000aand said, 'That's the end of it at last, Fermin,' and he walked back\u000ato the convent, and his shoulders were like the shoulders of an old\u000aman.
p7584
aV"After that he went out no more, and I took my blankets into his room\u000aand slept on the floor, and all night long I could hear him tossing\u000aon his cot.
p7585
aVSometimes he would say, 'Are you there, Fermin?'
p7586
aVand I\u000awould say, 'I am always here, mi teniente,' and then he would rest\u000afor a little while.
p7587
aV"But one night I woke and he was not on his cot.
p7588
aVI got up to look\u000aand he came in from the balcony--there was one of those closed\u000abalconies all around the convent, outside the rooms--and he was\u000adressed in his full uniform, and had his two revolvers and his\u000ashotgun.
p7589
aVHe did not seem to see me.
p7590
aV"'Mi teniente!'
p7591
aVI said.
p7592
aV"He looked where I was, and still he did not seem to see me.
p7593
aV'Keep a\u000agood lookout,' he said.
p7594
aV'They may come at any time.'
p7595
aVHe went out\u000ainto the balcony again, and I could hear his feet--tramp, tramp, very\u000aslow--while he went down to the far end and came back on the other\u000aside.
p7596
aV"A, but I was scared!
p7597
aVWe were all scared, for every night after\u000athat we could hear his feet, and he never seemed to see us, but\u000asometimes he would call: 'On guard, there!
p7598
aVThey may come at any\u000atime.'
p7599
aVWe were all scared, but we did all we could, if we were\u000afrightened.
p7600
aVNot one of us ran away, not even that baby Jos.
p7601
aV"And then the end came, the end of the game for my teniente.
p7602
aVFive\u000adays I brought his food and he never touched it, only drank\u000aaguardiente instead.
p7603
aVAnd five nights, all night long, we heard him\u000amarching round and round the balcony, with his two revolvers and his\u000ashotgun.
p7604
aVThe last night I was so tired that I fell asleep.
p7605
aVI do not\u000aknow how long I slept, but all at once I heard my teniente call\u000a'Halt!'
p7606
aVand then I heard him laugh, and then his feet, quick, as if\u000ahe ran, and then a crash on the ground outside.
p7607
aVI ran, and some of\u000athe guard ran, and we found him lying on the flagstones of the patio,\u000adead where he had fallen.
p7608
aV"That is the way they killed my teniente,--my teniente who might have\u000abeen Governor-General of the world if they had let him play the game.
p7609
aVHe was not afraid of the end of it.
p7610
aVEven when he was crazy, and\u000aheard the enemies we could not see coming, he only laughed and ran\u000aout to meet them."
p7611
aVA last ember of the fire flamed up, and Fermin Majusay turned his\u000aface quickly from the telltale light.
p7612
aV"It was a long story," he\u000asaid, and loosened his revolver in the holster.
p7613
aV"Sleep without fear,\u000aSeor," he said.
p7614
aV"No one will trouble us while I am here."
p7615
aVCHAPTER III\u000a\u000aTHE LITTLE MAN\u000a\u000aIt would be hard to say whether the porter or I was most bewildered\u000aby our meeting, for I, mind you, had made a long journey on the\u000amountain with Fermin Majusay, looking for a certain butterfly you\u000awouldn't be interested in, and had spent a whole night by the fire\u000awhich Fermin made, while the porter had only to go to the other end\u000aof the courtyard of the temple of Tzin Piau with his water-jug.
p7616
aVYet\u000awe returned from our respective errands at the same moment, and met\u000aat the door of my heathen tutor's cell!
p7617
aVThe porter came within an\u000aace of letting the jug fall, and I dare say I should have done the\u000asame thing, if I had had a jug.
p7618
aVThe old gentleman looked up at Nang and me, and into us, and through\u000aus, with eyes that smiled into vacancy, and at that moment, I think,\u000aI first began to entertain some doubts of his complete benevolence.
p7619
aV"Well, Nang," purred the old gentleman from his slab, "what's the\u000amatter with you?"
p7620
aV"Holy One," stammered the porter, "not two pipes ago I let this\u000agentleman out to go on a long journey.
p7621
aVAnd here he is.
p7622
aVAnd he has\u000anot come back, for I barred the gate behind him."
p7623
aV"Oh, well, Nang, what difference does that make?"
p7624
aVpurred the Holy\u000aOne, soothingly.
p7625
aV"You may go now."
p7626
aVThe porter went away, shaking his head and muttering, and my heathen\u000apriest and I were left alone together.
p7627
aV"And have you had," said he, raising himself a little on his hollowed\u000aslab, "an easy and a pleasant journey?"
p7628
aV"I did not go for pleasure," I answered sulkily, for I felt that he\u000awas mocking me.
p7629
aV"Ah, yes," he answered quickly, "it was for instruction.
p7630
aVI forgot.
p7631
aVAnd did you gain instruction from my Little Gods?"
p7632
aV"This time you sent me," I reminded him, "to see some Little Devils."
p7633
aVThe spark in his eyes flickered into flame again.
p7634
aV"Did I!"
p7635
aVhe\u000amurmured, purringly as a cat.
p7636
aV"How I keep forgetting.
p7637
aVBut after\u000aall, it's merely a matter of names.
p7638
aVDid you like what you saw?"
p7639
aV"No," I answered bluntly, "I did not.
p7640
aVYour Little Gods, or your\u000aLittle Devils, whatever you choose to call them, seem to me the\u000averiest fiends.
p7641
aVAnd cowardly fiends, at that.
p7642
aVThey catch men like\u000arats, in traps, and drown them, helpless, as men drown rats."
p7643
aV"My son," purred my old heathen priest, "I wouldn't call them\u000acowards, if I were you.
p7644
aVThey might not like it."
p7645
aV"Like it or not," said I, hotly, "they are cowards, if what I've seen\u000aof them is a fair sample of their ways.
p7646
aVDo they never give a man a\u000afair chance, in the open, to fight for his life, and for things\u000adearer to him than life?"
p7647
aV"For life and things dearer than life," echoed my old heathen priest,\u000aand yawned, ever so slightly, and stretched his old legs out on his\u000aslab.
p7648
aV"Dear me, I don't see why they shouldn't.
p7649
aVThough of course I\u000aknow nothing about it.
p7650
aVSuppose," he suggested, "you look that up for\u000ayourself.
p7651
aVI dislike to seem selfish, but really this is an hour\u000awhich I invariably devote to a nap."
p7652
aVHe made a little imperative, dismissing gesture with his hand, and--\u000a\u000a"An' this," says big Terry Clancy, reaching over and getting a grip\u000aon the little man's collar, "this is our Scuts, the married man."
p7653
aVI never served in a company yet--and I've served in so many, first\u000aand last, that I'll never do anything else--I never served in a\u000acompany yet that didn't have a bully and a fool in it.
p7654
aVYou can\u000aalways tell them.
p7655
aVNo one ever dares to cuss out the bully, and\u000asomebody is all the time cussin' out the fool.
p7656
aVIn the old company\u000athe bully was Clancy, relieving me, as Special Orders says.
p7657
aVWe had\u000asome argument about it at first, being about of a size and the\u000abiggest men there, but Terry was younger than me, and he relieved me.
p7658
aVThe fool was a poor little yellow dog that we called Scuts.
p7659
aVI don't\u000aeven remember his name.
p7660
aVHe was the most helpless, discouraged,\u000aweak-eyed little _hombre_ the sun ever dodged behind a cloud to keep\u000afrom shining on.
p7661
aVWorse than that, he had cold feet.
p7662
aVAll through the\u000aChina campaign he was so scared he needn't have been afraid at all.
p7663
aVA bullet couldn't hit such a little wrinkled, pinched-up thing as he\u000awas, even if it wanted to.
p7664
aVBut of course he got it worse than if\u000ahe'd been just plain fool.
p7665
aVThe company don't stand for cold feet.
p7666
aVEven the officers got to jollyin' about him.
p7667
aV"The little man," the\u000aCaptain always called him.
p7668
aV"H'm," grunts the Captain, the day we was\u000agetting it so bad in front of Tientsin.
p7669
aVOne of them club-footed\u000aChinese bullets had just bored through his leg, and it looked like\u000ahe'd bleed to death before the Doctor could fix him up.
p7670
aV"H'm.
p7671
aVArtery gone, you say?
p7672
aVWhere's the little man?
p7673
aVHe's just about the\u000asize to crawl in and hang onto it till you're ready to tie it.
p7674
aVH'm."
p7675
aVIt was the boys telling that to each other, and the Old Man's sending\u000adown the line afterwards to know if anybody had the makings of a\u000acigarette, that kept the company from breaking that day, I reckon.
p7676
aVWe got it hard.
p7677
aVIf the Old Man had been with us after that, Scuts\u000awould sure have had to go.
p7678
aVBut he being in hospital, the Lieutenant\u000ajust took the whole outfit with him, the part that could walk,\u000aanyway, and Scuts went back to Manila with us, and down to Samar.
p7679
aV"An' this," says Terry, picking Scuts off the bench and shaking him\u000acareless, like he was a rag baby, "is the idol of his company, the\u000abold bad soldier lad that won the heart an' tuba-stand of the\u000aprettiest little brown girl in Samar.
p7680
aVBoys," says he, spinning the\u000alittle man round with a thumb and finger in the back of his neck,\u000a"let me present the husband of the beauteous Marie.
p7681
aVBow to the\u000agentlemen, Scutsy."
p7682
aV"Aw, lemme go, Terry," says Scuts, blushing pink inside of his yellow\u000askin, and grinning like a puppy that's just been kicked.
p7683
aV"Aw, you\u000alemme go."
p7684
aV"You set down, Scuts," says Terry, spinning him round again and\u000alaying him on the bench.
p7685
aV"Set down an' tell us all about it.
p7686
aVGive\u000aus a tip.
p7687
aVWe're all wantin' to know how you did it.
p7688
aVWe might want\u000ato get married ourselves some day."
p7689
aV"Aw, you gwan," says Scuts, twistin' round, with that little damp\u000agrin of his.
p7690
aV"You're joshin' me."
p7691
aV"Man," says Terry, "'tis no josh.
p7692
aVHonor bright, we're all envyin'\u000ayou gettin' a fine pretty little girl like that.
p7693
aVEh, Casey?"
p7694
aVhe says\u000ato me.
p7695
aV"Straight goods," says I.
p7696
aV"The little man pulled down a cold hand\u000athat deal."
p7697
aV"Hear that, Scutsy?"
p7698
aVsays Terry.
p7699
aV"Come on, now, and tell us about\u000ait."
p7700
aV"Aw," says Scuts, throwing a chest as big around as my arm, and\u000atwisting a few white hairs on his upper lip, which was his way of\u000awagging his tail, "Aw," he says, "Marie, aw--I kind of helped her\u000akeepin' her books, y' know, showin' her how to spell the boys' names\u000aan' all that business, an' we got to be pretty good friends.
p7701
aVAn' one\u000aday she says to me, 'Scuts, all the girls but me has got American\u000aman, an' they laugh at me,' she says.
p7702
aV'Scuts, I want a 'Merican man\u000amyself.'
p7703
aV'All right,' I says, never thinkin' of myself, 'I'll tell\u000athe boys.'
p7704
aV'Scuts,' she says, 'I got plenty _dinero_ sellin' _tuba_\u000ato the boys, an' I likes you.
p7705
aVYou be my man.'
p7706
aVAw," says Scuts,\u000atwistin' the hairs, "I looked at her, an' I seen she was pretty\u000afair-lookin', so I says, 'All right, Marie.'
p7707
aVAn' I ain't ashamed of\u000ait, neither," says Scuts, looking round with his big blue eyes, as\u000athe crowd begins to laugh.
p7708
aV"She's 'bout th' nicest girl in this\u000atown, I reckon," Scuts says.
p7709
aV"Scuts, you gobble the pot," says Terry, twisting him off the bench.
p7710
aV"You run along to Marie right now, an' tell her to be sure and wrap a\u000ablanket round you before she puts you to bed.
p7711
aVWouldn't that beat\u000ahell, now," he says to us, watching the little man trot off\u000adown-town.
p7712
aV"They're all alike," he says.
p7713
aV"Give a white one fifty\u000aplunks to buy a dog, an' she'll come back with a blear-eyed,\u000aknock-kneed pug, and give a brown one a chance at th' company, an'\u000ashe picks out Scuts.
p7714
aVMarie's a good, girl, too.
p7715
aVThat's th' worst of\u000ait.
p7716
aVTh' better they are th' less they know," says Terry, "an' by th'\u000atime they get all th' _sabe_ they need, nobody'd take th'm for a\u000agift.
p7717
aVWho's comin' over in th' grove an' drink a cocoanut?"
p7718
aVThis was along before Balangiga, and things were running easy, the\u000aOld Man being still in hospital, and the Lieutenant being only a boy.
p7719
aVA straight boy he was, but not sure yet how he ought to take us.
p7720
aVThe\u000acountry was quiet and the people friendly as bugs, and we got\u000acareless.
p7721
aVAbout half the boys was sleepin' out of quarters off and\u000aon, and the Top didn't say anything.
p7722
aVI don't blame him.
p7723
aVOf course\u000ame and Terry and a lot of other old-timers didn't go in for that way\u000aof doing business, but it's different with a boy.
p7724
aVThe only home he\u000ahas while he's in the service is the kind he can make by hanging up\u000ahis hat and ordering the drinks, and he takes it pretty rough if you\u000adon't let him have that in a place like the Philippines.
p7725
aVSo we went\u000adrifting along with only two sentries posted, and the quarters half\u000aempty every night, never looking for any trouble.
p7726
aVBut one afternoon Scuts came trotting in, looking as yellow as\u000aDurham, and had a _hablar_ with the Top, and then they both went\u000aacross to the Lieutenant's quarters.
p7727
aVThey didn't come out till just\u000abefore Assembly went for Retreat, and we smelled something.
p7728
aVSure\u000aenough, orders was read to keep magazines loaded, carry two hundred\u000arounds in the belt, and not be absent from quarters between sunset\u000aand sunrise.
p7729
aVSoon as we were dismissed, we got after Scuts.
p7730
aV"The natives had it fixed to rush us at night," he says.
p7731
aV"Marie\u000atipped me off.
p7732
aVShe told me not to be out of quarters to-night, an'\u000ath' Top, he figured out the rest," says Scuts, shortsighting, you\u000amight say, out into the underbrush as if he expected to see a gang of\u000abolomen, and holding tight to his rifle.
p7733
aV"An' th' lady, she had another friend," sings out Piggy O'Neil.
p7734
aVThe\u000acrowd laughs, and Scuts turns a dirty pink again.
p7735
aV"Aw," he says, "she wouldn't tell me no lie.
p7736
aVShe's a good straight\u000agirl."
p7737
aVThen we began to debate it, the way we always do in the Army, if it's\u000aonly a question of how far it is from New York to the moon, and\u000afinally everybody called everybody else a liar and we went to sleep.
p7738
aVIn the morning everything was quiet and peaceful, so after drill the\u000acrowd was beginning to jolly Scuts for fair, when the operator stuck\u000ahis head out of the window.
p7739
aV"Come up here, some of you, for God's sake," he says, and we didn't\u000astop to ask questions.
p7740
aVHe was bending over his ticker, white as a\u000asheet.
p7741
aV"I'm a fool, all right," he says, "but this is sure gettin'\u000aon my nerve.
p7742
aVThere was a message started to go through from\u000aBalangiga ten minutes ago, and all to once--  Hear that!"
p7743
aVhe says.
p7744
aVThe machine gave a jerky little chatter.
p7745
aV"It's like a man sendin' in\u000ahis sleep," says the operator.
p7746
aV"For ten mortal minutes that thing\u000ahas been stuttering halves of words."
p7747
aV"Who is it?"
p7748
aVasks Terry.
p7749
aV"Murphy's sendin'," says the operator.
p7750
aV"Then he's jokin' with ye," says Terry.
p7751
aV"Billy always was a great\u000ahand for his--"\u000a\u000a"Huh?"
p7752
aVgrunts the operator, bending over, as she begun to stutter\u000aagain.
p7753
aV"What's he saying?"
p7754
aVsomebody asked, but the operator didn't seem to\u000ahear him.
p7755
aVThen all at once he began to talk in a voice that didn't\u000abelong to him.
p7756
aV"Balangiga," he read, "seven-ten A.M. Company--attacked\u000aby--bolomen--while at--breakfast.
p7757
aVRifles in quarters.
p7758
aVFought\u000awith--dishes and--knives and forks--but--no good--"\u000a\u000a[Illustration: "_Fought with--dishes and--knives and forks._"]\u000a\u000a"God!"
p7759
aVsays somebody, and a dozen say, "Shut up."
p7760
aVBut the operator didn't seem to mind.
p7761
aV"Look out for--yourselves," he\u000aread.
p7762
aVAnd then he begun to call out a list of names, very slow, and\u000abetween each one you could hear the crowd draw a long breath.
p7763
aV"Sullivan--Brewster--Fleishart--Nickerson--"\u000a\u000a"Is that Tommy Nickerson?"
p7764
aVsays somebody.
p7765
aV"Shut up," says Terry.
p7766
aV"But Tommy was my bunky for three--"\u000a\u000a"--Slavin--" reads the operator--"Kelly--Hunt--" and so he goes on,\u000aTerry checking off till we thought he never would stop.
p7767
aV"Fourty-five, fourty-six, fourty-seven, fourty-eight," he says.
p7768
aVThen\u000athe machine stopped talking.
p7769
aV"That's all," says Terry.
p7770
aV"Fourty-eight good men that they've killed--"\u000a\u000a"Huh?"
p7771
aVgrunts the man again, and then the machine began to click very\u000aslow, and the operator's eyes bulged out of his head.
p7772
aV"Murphy!"
p7773
aVhe\u000asays.
p7774
aV"Christ," he says, "it can't be Murphy.
p7775
aVMurphy's sendin'.
p7776
aVBilly," he says, jabbing at his key and then listening.
p7777
aVThe machine\u000aclicked once or twice and then stopped.
p7778
aVThe operator turns round to\u000aus.
p7779
aV"It's Billy," he says.
p7780
aV"Billy's been sendin' this, an' he's\u000adead."
p7781
aVThe big fellow just dropped down on his table and cried.
p7782
aVWe looked at him and we looked at each other, and then we went\u000adown-stairs on tiptoe, like there was a dyin' man in the house.
p7783
aV"Fourty-nine," says Terry, whispering like--"fourty-nine men of the\u000aregiment killed at breakfast, with no show to help themselves.
p7784
aVGod!
p7785
aVAnd we might a got the same thing only--Scuts," he says, "where's\u000athat little woman o' yours?"
p7786
aV"Warn't she straight?"
p7787
aVsays Scuts, throwing his chest.
p7788
aV"You poor fool," Terry shouts, "go and get her up here before those\u000adevils suspect she told us.
p7789
aVTake your rifle, damn you," he says, as\u000athe little man trotted off.
p7790
aV"Fourty-nine o' them killed fightin'\u000awith their mess-kits.
p7791
aVGod!"
p7792
aVJust as we was getting into our kits, Scuts comes back.
p7793
aV"I can't\u000afind her," he says.
p7794
aV"I ast her mother, an' she just grinned at me,"\u000ahe says, staring out of the window as if he expects to see her there.
p7795
aV"I can't find her," he says.
p7796
aV"Terry, do you s'pose--"\u000a\u000a"Scuts," Terry yells at him, "you get ready to go out on this patrol\u000awith us.
p7797
aVDo you hear, or have I got to bat you?"
p7798
aVhe says, like he\u000ameant it.
p7799
aVWe scouted down through the town, the people smiling at us just as\u000afriendly as ever, and never a sign of Marie could we get.
p7800
aVSo we\u000aswung out through the paddies and circled the town, coming back\u000atoward the quarters through the grove of cocoa-palms.
p7801
aVThe Lieutenant\u000awas on the point, and all at once he stopped short.
p7802
aVWe pushed up,\u000aand there, tied to a big palm-tree, was something I've tried hard to\u000aforget.
p7803
aV'Twouldn't have been so bad if she had just been dead, but\u000aall at once she--\u000a\u000a"They cut her all to pieces an' it didn't kill her," says Scuts,\u000asurprised like.
p7804
aVThe Lieutenant pulls his gun.
p7805
aV"Right or wrong, I can't stand that,"\u000ahe says, and fires.
p7806
aVThe little man never flinched at the report.
p7807
aV"They cut her all to\u000apieces, an' it didn't kill her," he says again, kind of like a\u000aphonograph.
p7808
aV"You get out of here, Scuts," says Terry, grabbing him by the\u000ashoulder and whirling him round.
p7809
aV"You leave me be," whines the little man.
p7810
aV"God!"
p7811
aVhe says.
p7812
aV"Cut her\u000alike that, an' it didn't kill her!
p7813
aVAn' her such a soft little\u000athing--"\u000a\u000a"Damn you, Scuts," says Terry, "will you cut it out, or have I got to\u000abreak your head?"
p7814
aV"Aw, you lemme alone," whines Scuts, meek as ever.
p7815
aV"I'm a goin',\u000aain't I?"
p7816
aVAnd he turns and trots back to quarters, never saying\u000aanother word.
p7817
aVWhen we told the boys, there was cursing like you won't hear often\u000aoutside the service, but after Terry had took them out in the grove\u000ain squads of half a dozen, they just stopped talking and sat down\u000aquiet in the sun, cleaning their rifles and looking at the town over\u000aacross the parade.
p7818
aVAll at once, a rifle cracked, and a native over\u000athere cut for cover like a hen.
p7819
aVThe Lieutenant came running down.
p7820
aV"Whose gun was that?"
p7821
aVhe asks.
p7822
aVOld John Slattery, the oldest man in the company, with twenty-eight\u000ayears in, gets up slow and stiff, and salutes.
p7823
aV"Mine, sir," he says.
p7824
aV"I was workin' the cartridges out of the magazine, an' she must've\u000agone off accidental."
p7825
aVThe boy just looks at us for about a minute.
p7826
aV"The next one of you\u000athat fires a shot without orders," he says, "will stand up against\u000athe convent wall there in front of a squad, if I'm the only man in\u000athe squad.
p7827
aVWhen the time comes," he says, "you'll have all the\u000ashooting you want.
p7828
aVUntil then, you'll leave the natives alone, or\u000ayou'll have to kill me."
p7829
aVIt was hard holding in, thinking of Marie over there among the\u000apalm-trees, and the boys in Balangiga, and Billy Murphy making his\u000alittle speech over the wire; but the Lieutenant was right, and when\u000athe orders did come, we didn't have any kick coming about the way he\u000alet us carry them out.
p7830
aVIt was the roughest little old fighting I've\u000aever been through.
p7831
aVYou'd naturally thought the little man would brace up and get into\u000ait, after seeing what he'd seen.
p7832
aVBut he just got peakeder and meeker\u000aevery day.
p7833
aVSeemed like he was half asleep, and only woke up long\u000aenough to talk about his dreams.
p7834
aVAnd his talk was enough to drive\u000ayou loco.
p7835
aVOne night we'd just come into camp, when Terry pitched his rifle away\u000aand dug for his boot as fast as he could.
p7836
aV"Damn that ant," he says.
p7837
aV"Who'd think a little thing like that could bite worse'n a good big\u000ahorse-fly?"
p7838
aV"Terry," says Scuts, "how do you reckon it feels to have millions of\u000ared ants crawlin' all over you, an' you all cut an'--"\u000a\u000a"Damn you, Scuts," says Terry, reaching for him and cuffing him,\u000a"will you shut up?"
p7839
aVAt last one day we ran into them in full force in a little meadow\u000athat was broken up with clumps of bamboo and tall grass.
p7840
aVWe started\u000afiring in close order, for it's dangerous to get spread out in\u000acountry like that, when you're fighting men with knives.
p7841
aVBut after a\u000awhile, them rushing first one side of the line and then the other,\u000aand us getting after them with the bayonet, we opened out.
p7842
aVFinally\u000awe got 'em going just like we wanted 'em, in bunches.
p7843
aVWe'd fire as\u000athey ran till they had to drop into cover, and then we'd rush 'em\u000awith the bayonet and butt.
p7844
aVIt was the easiest sort of going, more\u000alike chasing rabbits than men, and when the recall blowed we had only\u000afive men missing, Scuts among them.
p7845
aVThe Lieutenant sent out half a\u000adozen of us to hunt them up, and in a little hollow, 'way ahead of\u000awhere anybody else had gone, we found the little man lying curled up\u000aon his face looking comfortable, the way a man that's been killed\u000aquick most always does.
p7846
aVAround him there was a heap of dead natives,\u000ano wounded ones.
p7847
aVTerry turned him over.
p7848
aVHe had a bolo in his hand,\u000aand he was smiling his little weak-eyed smile.
p7849
aV"The son of a gun!"
p7850
aVsays Terry, gulping.
p7851
aV"The damn little son of a\u000agun!
p7852
aVWhat the hell are you fellers standin' there for?"
p7853
aVhe says to\u000aus, picking up the little man and laying him over his shoulder.
p7854
aV"There's four other lads you've got to find before sundown."
p7855
aVCHAPTER IV\u000a\u000aA LITTLE RIPPLE OF PATRIOTISM\u000a\u000a"You are bold, my son, at any rate," murmured my heathen priest,\u000ablandly smiling through me into vacancy.
p7856
aV"The last man to knock at\u000athe gate of Tzin Piau with his foot, found the foot grown fast to\u000athe stone.
p7857
aVThey had to cut it off to set him free.
p7858
aVThat must have\u000abeen a hundred years ago, more or less.
p7859
aVI forget.
p7860
aVThe foot, with\u000athe gate-post attached to it, is standing in the Great Hall of the\u000aImages.
p7861
aVRelic, you know.
p7862
aVIt's rather interesting, it's so out of\u000athe common run of relics.
p7863
aVYou might like to glance at it?"
p7864
aV"No, indeed," I said hastily.
p7865
aVSomething in my old gentleman's\u000ablandness was anything but reassuring.
p7866
aV"I beg Tzin Piau's pardon, I\u000aam sure," said I.
p7867
aV"And," said I, pulling out my purse, "if in my\u000ahurry I was unfortunate enough to injure the door in any way, I'd be\u000amore than glad--"\u000a\u000a"Not at all, not at all," my old gentleman assured me.
p7868
aV"It's a very\u000asolid door, indeed."
p7869
aV"I'm so glad of that," said I, putting up my purse.
p7870
aV"Still," purred the old gentleman thoughtfully, "of course one can\u000anever tell just how a god may feel about irreverence.
p7871
aVIn cases of\u000adoubt, the small precaution of an offering--"\u000a\u000aI handed him a piece of gold, and he stowed it away, very carefully,\u000ain his girdle, just over the pit of his stomach.
p7872
aV"My son," he said\u000abenignantly, "through me, his representative, T'zin Piau deigns to\u000athank you and assure you that all is forgotten."
p7873
aVReceiving the thanks of a god was such an unwonted experience to me\u000athat I was not sure I could acknowledge them in proper form.
p7874
aVSo I\u000abowed, and held my tongue.
p7875
aVThere are worse moves, in tight places,\u000afor one who can bow with dignity.
p7876
aV"And now, my son," said my old gentleman, poking subconsciously with\u000athe forefinger of his right hand at a hard spot just over his\u000astomach, "tell me what has put you out.
p7877
aVFor you are put out."
p7878
aV"It's your infernal Little Gods," said I, boldly.
p7879
aV"I'm sick of them."
p7880
aV"My infernal Little Gods!"
p7881
aVhe murmured.
p7882
aV"What a curious conjunction\u000aof contradictory terms.
p7883
aVAnd so you are sick of them.
p7884
aVWhy?"
p7885
aV"Their taste seems to run wholly to Tragedy," I complained, "and such\u000adingy Tragedy.
p7886
aVAnd such unnecessary Tragedy.
p7887
aVHow they do work to\u000aentangle some childish negro giant, some weak simpleton of a common\u000asoldier--"\u000a\u000aMy old gentleman yawned, hard as he strove to conceal the fact.
p7888
aV"You\u000amust excuse me," he purred, when he saw that I had seen, "but really,\u000aat this hour--  Suppose," he suggested, sinking back on his slab,\u000a"you watch a Farce or two, by way of change.
p7889
aVHow will that do?"
p7890
aV"If you think there are any Farces in the Orient," I said doubtfully,\u000a"I'm sure I'd be very glad--"\u000a\u000a"It's easy to find out," said he, and moved his hand a little, and--I\u000aheard a voice speaking, an even, drawling, dryly humorous voice.
p7891
aVThis is what it said.
p7892
aV"Want passes, eh?
p7893
aVTwelve-hour passes?
p7894
aVH'm," says the Captain.
p7895
aVMe\u000aand Big Terry Clancy and three or four others was standin' up in\u000afront of him with three months' pay in our blouses, lookin' pleasant\u000aand harmless for a fare-ye-well.
p7896
aV"H'm," he says, "you're a fine\u000abunch.
p7897
aVCan you remember you're in Maniller now, not Samar?"
p7898
aV"We can, sir," says Terry.
p7899
aV"H'm.
p7900
aVTake your mouth out fr'm under your chin, Clancy," says th'\u000aOld Man.
p7901
aV"It looks better.
p7902
aVH'm.
p7903
aVWell, go along with ye, and if ye\u000aget into trouble ast th' Lord to have mercy on your crazy heads, for\u000aye know well by this time that I won't," he says.
p7904
aVWith that he signs the passes, an' that's where he let us all in for\u000ait.
p7905
aVYes, sir, me and Terry an' th' Old Man and the Regiment and the\u000aLittle Brown Brother and the C.G.
p7906
aVall had ours comin' right then,\u000aon'y we didn't know about it, not yet.
p7907
aVWe thought we was just\u000ahomeward bound, and we wanted a little fun with Maniller to make up\u000afor the deeprivations of the Samar campaign.
p7908
aVWe got it all right.
p7909
aV"H'm," says the Captain, dealin' us the passes.
p7910
aV"I'm sorry f'r\u000aManiller, but ye have earned a little reelaxation.
p7911
aVDon't forget\u000ayou're f'r guard to-morrer, Casey," he says to me, an' we saluted an'\u000ahit th' trail.
p7912
aVTerry and me clumb into a two-wheeled chicken-coop wagon outside the\u000aBarracks, and th' horse not bein' only boy's size we lifted him by\u000ath' slings, th' pair of us, and just naturally wandered on tiptoe\u000adown to th' New Bridge.
p7913
aVThey give you th' biggest schooner of San\u000aMagill f'r your _peseta_ there.
p7914
aVNew Bridge is th' name.
p7915
aVAnybody can\u000atell you.
p7916
aVWe had some beers, and then we went across to Mrs. Smith's, and got a\u000asteak that never seen a tin can, and then we went back to the New\u000aBridge and met up with some more of th' Army.
p7917
aVThere was an\u000aEngineer't could deal himself th' coldest hand of talk I ever bucked\u000aup against, and two Coast Artillerys, and a Marine, an Irishman named\u000aSchleimacher, that Clancy remembered helpin' to stuff a jade idol\u000ainto his blouse, up in Peking those happy days.
p7918
aVMaybe there was\u000aothers.
p7919
aVI don't remember.
p7920
aVI don't remember a whole lot of things about that day.
p7921
aVSome way, the\u000abeer was cold, and along in the middle of th' afternoon my thoughts\u000agot to herdin' close, an' it was more'n I could do to cut some of\u000ath'm out of th' bunch an' read th' brands on th'm.
p7922
aVThere must a been\u000astrays around, too, for all of-a sudden I got to cryin' about me dear\u000aould mither an' th' little cabin--_Me_!
p7923
aVI was born in Springfield,\u000aMassachusetts, in a tenement, and I pulled my freight for Arizona as\u000asoon as I could walk.
p7924
aVBut I sure was cryin' about that thought,\u000awhoever it belonged to, and the Engineer ast me what th' trouble was,\u000aand I told on myself.
p7925
aV"Gentlemen o' France," says he--I ain't quotin' him exact, f'r I'm no\u000acollege graduate--"Gentlemen o' France, and Ireland, what say you to\u000acharterin' a couple of wagons, large, glad wagons with rubber tires,\u000aand carryin' our brother out to refresh his homesick eyes on th'\u000aemerald, sunburnt sod of th' Luneta, whilst Professor Lovering's\u000agu-gu band flirts with sweet music and we watches th' sunset glow on\u000aMariveles?"
p7926
aVYes, sir, right off'n th' bat he showed down a hand of talk like\u000athat, all aces an' better.
p7927
aVIt fazed us f'r a minute.
p7928
aVHe was a warm\u000aboy, that Engineer.
p7929
aVBut old Terry was game.
p7930
aV"Son of th' pick-axe an' th' thebobolite," he says, startin' to play\u000aup, "lead on," he says, "that is--if--if ye mean go to th' band\u000aconcert, we're with ye while th' money lasts," he finishes, winded.
p7931
aVSo we gets a couple of victoriers, two horses apiece, footmen and\u000aall, and strikes for th' Luneta, makin' full as much show as any\u000acivilian clerk in th' Q.M.D.
p7932
aVMore, maybe, f'r that Irishman\u000aSchleimacher wants to put his feet up on th' box.
p7933
aVWe tried to make\u000ahim ride decent, but th' Engineer butted in.
p7934
aV"Let him be," he says.
p7935
aV"Otherwise what's th' use of th' footman, anyway?"
p7936
aVSo Sly kep' them\u000aup there, and I reckon we attracted a lot of attention that didn't\u000acost us a cent.
p7937
aVBy the time we got out there by the beach, th' air had cleared up my\u000ahead some, and I sat up and began to take notice.
p7938
aVAnd about the\u000afirst thing I noticed hard was Terry.
p7939
aVHe'd quit talkin', an' there\u000awas a hell uv a disdainful look on that two-foot face of his, and he\u000atook off his hat to the flagpole when we went by it, second trip\u000around.
p7940
aVI'd ought to have stopped th' game right then.
p7941
aVThere's two\u000akinds of Irish, if y' ever noticed,--common wild ones that generally\u000ahas the luck to meet Old Trouble when she comes marchin' down th'\u000astreet, comp'ny front; and th' fancy kind that could recruit a whole\u000abunch o' trouble right in th' middle of Paco bone-heap.
p7942
aVTerry's that\u000alast kind, and when he gets low-spirited and patriotic and full of\u000abeer, it's time to hunt for the tall and uncut.
p7943
aVWell, the band kep' on a playin', an' th' sun kep' on a settin' and\u000awe kep' on a drivin' round and round that mangy bunch o' grass, and\u000aev'ry trip Terry got glummer and glummer.
p7944
aVAfter a while, he says to\u000ame: "Look at th' pretty ladies, Casey, all th' pretty ladies in white\u000adresses an' talcum powder, if not worse.
p7945
aVAn' spot th' gay young\u000agrafters in th' morgidged rigs.
p7946
aVYou and me can't speak to th' likes\u000aof them, Casey.
p7947
aVWe're nothin' but soldiers.
p7948
aVThat's all.
p7949
aVJust\u000asoldiers, gettin' it in th' neck for fifteen-sixty per.
p7950
aVOh, hell!"
p7951
aVhe says, and spits hard and straight at a swell native in white\u000aclothes, that was waitin' for us to pass, "Look at him with shoes on,\u000alike a white man!
p7952
aVAin't there a ripple o' patriotism in th' whole\u000adamned outfit?
p7953
aVThere's th' old flag flyin' up above th'm, an' they\u000anever think of it.
p7954
aVJust ride around and flirt with each other, and\u000alet natives walk around with shoes on, like white men.
p7955
aVThey make me\u000asick.
p7956
aVI'm on'y a soldier, an' I suppose th' Army is th' on'y place\u000af'r lads like me and you--" he says.
p7957
aVHe's ready to cry, an' th' Engineer butts in to change th' subjick.
p7958
aV"So say our long-suffering parents and sweethearts," he says.
p7959
aV"Pontoons," says Terry, talkin' fr'm about an inch below his\u000astummick, "you're a lively lad with y'r tongue, but ye lack dep'.
p7960
aVI\u000aain't known ye long, an' I hope I ain't to know ye much longer, but I\u000acan see ye lack more dep' 'n any man I ever met.
p7961
aVThere's moments in\u000ath' life of a real man ye couldn't no more understand 'n a Chinese\u000astorekeeper.
p7962
aVAn' this is one of th'm," he says, pullin' his hat down\u000aover his eyes.
p7963
aVHe didn't say no more, but when th' nigger band struck up th'\u000aUmpty-dee-he-hee-_heee_ music, to show it was all over now, Terry got\u000aup slow and stiff, and threw a chest and squeezed his hat to his left\u000abreast and stood there in th' rig, lookin' considerable like some\u000agen'rals you and me've seen.
p7964
aVHe kep' on standin' there after th'\u000amusic had stopped, and after a while it got tiresome, and th'\u000aEngineer told th' _cochero_ to _sigue_ ahead.
p7965
aV"_Hindi!_" says Terry.
p7966
aV"Don't you believe it.
p7967
aVYou're like all th'\u000arest," he says to us, plumb disgusted.
p7968
aV"You call yourselves\u000asoldiers, and all you think about is just chow.
p7969
aVChow, at a moment\u000alike this!
p7970
aVThere ain't a ripple of patriotism in the whole bunch of\u000aye big enough to grease a twenty-two cartridge."
p7971
aVAnd he made us drive\u000aup and down th' Malecon twice in th' moonlight before he'd go to\u000asupper.
p7972
aVWhile we was chowin', he kep' gettin' grumper an' grumper, and after\u000asupper, when th' Engineer wanted to be gettin' back to quarters--he\u000awas livin' over'n old Santiaygo--Terry just busted loose.
p7973
aV"Pontoons," he says, "I t'ought you was a man.
p7974
aVYou're big enough f'r\u000aone.
p7975
aVRun away an' join th' Naytional Guard.
p7976
aVGo an' be a\u000apinkety-pink Vol'nteer, an' tell th' nurs'ry-sergeant not to wake you\u000aup without your p'rmission.
p7977
aVGo an' dog-rob f'r a c'mission.
p7978
aVGo an'\u000ado this an' do that," he says, thinkin' up a whole lot of places f'r\u000ath' Engineer to go, till fin'lly he got so ugly-ugly we took him into\u000ath' New Bridge again, and bought him a drink to calm him down.
p7979
aVIt didn't do no good.
p7980
aVHe kep' one eye on his glass an' th' other on\u000athe Engineer, an' slung hot air till you wouldn't think a big guy\u000alike that would stand f'r it.
p7981
aVBut th' Engineer just grins and drinks\u000ahis beer.
p7982
aV"Gentlemen," he says, "gentlemen and friend Clancy, there's a\u000ahard-hearted son of Plymouth Rock commands th' comp'ny that'll be\u000aroundin' up all th' poor little devils to check roll-call six times a\u000aday before he's been dead a month.
p7983
aVHe'll mult me a month's pay f'r\u000amissin' Retreat to-night--not that th' pleasure of enjoyin' you ain't\u000aworth th' price," he says to Terry, "but I might just as well miss\u000aTaps now, an' get a month in th' jug besides.
p7984
aVWhat's th' use of\u000afreedom without money?
p7985
aVTo-night we have both, and we'll pour them\u000aout like blood, to soothe th' feelin's of a friend whose heart is sad\u000ato think th' flag which decked his cradle now floats over th'\u000aschool-houses of th' brave but ex-tremely eelusive Fillypeeners."
p7986
aVTerry's mouth sort of hung open when th' Engineer struck his pace,\u000abut he brightened up quick as he got on to the drift of it.
p7987
aV"Ye read my feelin's like a _padre_," he says to him, "an' I like\u000ayour build.
p7988
aVIf you was on'y in th' comp'ny, it's many a fight we'd\u000ahave together, an' we may have one even yet.
p7989
aVHere's lookin' at ye!
p7990
aVYou're a soldier, you are, and a gentleman.
p7991
aVHere's how."
p7992
aVOf course we had a beer on the Engineer after that, and two on the\u000aCoast Artillerys, who'd been sayin' little all day and drinkin'\u000ahearty.
p7993
aVTh' poor devils get that way, bein' stationed mostly near\u000abig cities like Portland, Maine, an' Guam, where chanstes are few\u000asince th' Christian Temp'rance persons got their strangle-holt.
p7994
aVAnd\u000athen our A.O.H.
p7995
aVfriend, Schleimacher, sets them up an' says:\u000a"Fellers, a sailor like me--"\u000a\u000a"Don't you miscall yourself; you're more of soldier than a heap of\u000ath' muts I herd with," says Terry, takin' a sling at us, "but ye do\u000aloot like a sailor," he says.
p7996
aV"I'm a soldier at sea, all right," says th' Marine.
p7997
aV"I'm seasick as\u000aan Army Transport ev'ry trip.
p7998
aVI was talkin' when you butted in.
p7999
aVA\u000asailor like me don't have many look-ins f'r what you might call\u000areefined amusements.
p8000
aVCavite's mostly give up to drill an'\u000acock-fights.
p8001
aVI moves we all go to a nigger theayter to-night, where\u000athere's sure to be plenty doin', such as it is."
p8002
aVWe went, victoriers and all, and Old Trouble must a been howlin' f'r\u000ajoy to see us comin'.
p8003
aVWhen we got there, there was a big crowd\u000aoutside, and we got wedged up against one of th' stands where th'\u000agirls sell bananas and cigarettes an' such truck.
p8004
aVOne of th'm--a\u000apretty good-lookin' girl she was, too--smiles at Terry, and he opens\u000aup a conversation, and fin'lly he says to me: "'Tis a long time since\u000aI've et a hard-boiled egg.
p8005
aVI'm goin' to have a couple if they're\u000afresh.
p8006
aV"_Frescoes?_" he asts, pointin' to the eggs.
p8007
aV"_Wavoes frescoes?_"\u000a_Fresco_ means cool in common bamboo Spanish, but he was usin' a\u000aprivate Castilian brand of his own.
p8008
aV"_Wavoes frescoes?_" he asts.
p8009
aV"Is the eggs cool?"
p8010
aVTh' girl laughs.
p8011
aV"_Como helados, chiquito mio_," she says, laughin'.
p8012
aV"Like ice, my\u000ahoney-bunch," she says.
p8013
aV"Give me two, then, an' keep th' change," says Terry.
p8014
aV"_Dos_!
p8015
aVYou're a neat little gu-gu," he says, holdin' up his two fingers.
p8016
aVHe broke one of his eggs, and he dropped it quick.
p8017
aV"Ye little merrocker-leather daughter o' sin and shame," he says to\u000ath' girl--I ain't quotin' _him_ exact neither--"ye little\u000atwo-f'r-a-cent bunch o' calicker," he says, mixin' in some other\u000awords on the side, "bein' a lady, I can't say what I think of you,\u000abut it ain't such a hell uv a much.
p8018
aVDon't ye grin at _me_!
p8019
aVI might\u000ahave _et_ that!
p8020
aVIf it had on'y knowed enough to _peep_," he says to\u000aus, "it needn't never have got boiled alive.
p8021
aV_Wavoes frescoes_!
p8022
aVDamn a country where a pretty girl will lie to you f'r half a cent.
p8023
aVI'll keep th' other one till I'm sure hungry," he says, an' slips his\u000aother egg into his pocket.
p8024
aVHe kep' on mutterin' to himself while he was squeezin' up to th'\u000alittle window, and a good tight squeeze we had.
p8025
aVY' see, old Ma\u000aTrouble[1] had c'llected a special crowd f'r the occasion, but we\u000anever noticed that.
p8026
aVWe just hiked ahead, and havin' plenty of\u000amoney--though little of it was left by that time--we bought a box,\u000aand went in.
p8027
aV[1] It is interesting to note that Private Casey himself seems half\u000aaware that some maliciously mirthful over-power is concerned in his\u000aadventures.
p8028
aVBut why does he feminize it?
p8029
aVMaybe you've never been in a gu-gu theayter.
p8030
aVTh' floor is th'\u000aground, an' that's the orchestray.
p8031
aVAround that runs a row of boxes\u000awithout any fronts or backs or tops or sides.
p8032
aVBehind them is th'\u000abalcony.
p8033
aVWell, we swell guys pikes up to our box and starts in to be\u000ath' real thing.
p8034
aVIn one of them theayters you want to keep your hat\u000aon till th' curtain rises, an' smoke cigarettes an' look round at th'\u000awomen.
p8035
aVThey expects it.
p8036
aVThat was easy f'r us, an' th' Engineer gets\u000aup a two-handed game of eyes with a chocolate-colored dame that\u000abegins to look entanglin'.
p8037
aVBut Terry broke it up.
p8038
aV"Turn round," he says.
p8039
aV"Cut it out.
p8040
aVShe'll be settin' in your lap\u000ain a minute, an' stealin' th' buttons off'n your blouse.
p8041
aVDon't ye\u000atrust any of th'm," he says.
p8042
aV"_Wavoes frescoes!_"\u000a\u000aAnd right there old Ma plays her joker.
p8043
aVThat drayma we'd come so far\u000ato see was called "Kahapon--" but maybe you don't _sabe hablar_\u000aFillypeener.
p8044
aV"Yesterday, To-day, and To-morrer," was th' name.
p8045
aVTh'\u000afirst act was Yesterday.
p8046
aVThat was Spain.
p8047
aVThere was nothin' much\u000adoin' f'r a while.
p8048
aVJust talkin' slow an' keepin' your hand on your\u000aknife, a good deal like that Greaser show that come to San Antone\u000aonce.
p8049
aVBut after a while, a priest showed up.
p8050
aVHe was one of th'\u000aFriars, and they knocked him down first off, an' then they kicked him\u000aall over th' stage, and sat on him and raised a rough-house with him\u000afor fair.
p8051
aVThem _Frailes_ must a been a long-sufferin' bunch,\u000aYesterday.
p8052
aVThey'd just tossed him out of sight, when a lot of Spanish soldiers\u000acome on and th' real shootin' begun.
p8053
aVWell, sir, th' Fillypeeners\u000acleaned them Greasers out for keeps, an' th' little leadin' lady\u000agrabs th' Spanish flag an' rips it up th' middle an' promenades on\u000ath' pieces.
p8054
aVTh' house went wild at that, and while they was clappin'\u000aan' shoutin', the sun of Fillypeener liberty begun to rise at th'\u000aback of the stage.
p8055
aVIt was a shaky old sun with three K's on its\u000aface, like freckles.
p8056
aVI see Terry fumblin' in his pocket for\u000asomethin', and then, just as th' sun is gettin' fairly up, somethin'\u000aputs th' poor thing's eye out, and th' curtain falls quick.
p8057
aV"_Wavoes frescoes!_" Terry sings out.
p8058
aVWell, sir, things livened up somethin' wonderful just about then.
p8059
aVAll th' natives in th' place, about a thousand of th'm, begun to yowl\u000alike cats and crowd toward our box, and half a dozen Spaniards, or\u000ahalf-Spaniards, was yellin' "_Brayvo el Americano!_" and some\u000aAmericans that was scattered round th' audience was movin' up at th'\u000adouble without sayin' anythin'.
p8060
aV"Nothin' doin', boys," Terry yells to them, standin' up, and a big\u000aman he looked.
p8061
aV"Scat!"
p8062
aVhe says to th' natives.
p8063
aV"_Sigue Dagupan_,\u000ayou _Kittycattypunanos_, before I chew you up," he says, and makes\u000alike he was goin' to jump down among th'm.
p8064
aVThey scatted all right, and we pulled Terry down, quiet enough, on'y\u000ahis shoulders was twitchin' under his blouse.
p8065
aV"Casey," he says to\u000ame, "I always took the Fillypeeners f'r Catholics till I seen th'm\u000amaul that _padre_, an' I've been gentle with th'm on that account.
p8066
aVGod help th' next one I lay foot to."
p8067
aV"I mistrust this is one of th' seditious plays we read about," th'\u000aEngineer whispers to me, "and I reckon To-day will be worse than\u000aYesterday, f'r the big man.
p8068
aVHadn't we better get him out of here?"
p8069
aV"His patriotism is sure ripplin' lively," I says.
p8070
aV"An' did ye never read th' po'm," says th' lad, "about th' pebble\u000adropped in th' middle of th' ocean, an' th' ripples it kicked up?"
p8071
aV"I never read no po'try," I says, "if I see it first, but\u000asomething'll be kicked up f'r keeps, if Terry ever drops down in that\u000acrowd."
p8072
aVAnd then th' house quieted down, an' th' curtain went up f'r\u000ath' next act.
p8073
aVTo-day was us, th' Americans.
p8074
aVA little gen'ral with pompydoor\u000ahair--that looked natchral--walked round f'r a while, hablaring to\u000ahis crowd, and then six men in khaki came in, carryin' th' flag, and\u000ath' other gang began to shoot them up.
p8075
aVIt warn't pretty to watch,\u000aon'y we didn't have time to watch it much.
p8076
aVTh' Engineer an' me had\u000aone of Terry's arms, and Schleimacher was tryin' to keep a hand over\u000ahis mouth and not get bit.
p8077
aVTh' talk he was tryin' to make was\u000ashockin'.
p8078
aVBut we held him all right till th' Americans was lyin'\u000around th' stage picturesque and dead as hell.
p8079
aVAn' then th' little\u000agirl grabs th' flag, and you could hear the audience draw a long\u000abreath.
p8080
aVI didn't think she'd dare to do it, but I suppose it was on th'\u000aprogramme and they didn't want to give no money back.
p8081
aVSure enough\u000ashe spits on it an' tosses it on th' floor, and then--well, Terry\u000abrushes the Engineer and me out of his way, and steps up on the edge\u000aof the box and makes his little speech.
p8082
aV"Boys!"
p8083
aVhe yells, "remember\u000aBalangiga an' th' rest of th' tricks they've played us.
p8084
aVThat's th'\u000aflag," and he hops down to the floor.
p8085
aV"Come on," I yells to the Engineer.
p8086
aV"If he gets on that stage alone,\u000ait'll be murder," and down we jumps.
p8087
aVIt was like slippin' off a ford into quick water.
p8088
aVThe women was\u000ascreechin' and the men howlin' and the boys behind us was laughin'\u000aand shoutin' and bangin' every head that came their way, and some\u000afool begun to let off a gun into the roof.
p8089
aVBut th' Engineer and me\u000ajust kep' on down that aisle after Terry.
p8090
aVJust when he reached th'\u000amusicians, the curtain came down, but he picks a fiddler, fiddle and\u000aall, and tosses him into th' rotten old cloth like a sack of beans,\u000aand goes through th' hole after him.
p8091
aVBut it stopped him up enough so't the Engineer and me clumb through\u000aonto the stage right behind him.
p8092
aVWe piled onto him just as he was\u000amakin' a rush f'r a bunch of actors, and there was a good lively\u000amix-up f'r a few seconds.
p8093
aVMen began to come through the curtain in a\u000adozen places, and th' racket in the house doubled up.
p8094
aVI don't know\u000ajust everythin' that happened, f'r th' minute Terry gave in a bit, we\u000adrug him out th' back way and cut up an alley, never stoppin' to find\u000aout where Schleimacher and the Artillerys was.
p8095
aVAnd I s'pose them\u000avictoriers is out front there yet, waitin' for their money.
p8096
aVAnd I'll\u000abet there never was no To-morrer in that drayma, not that night.
p8097
aVWe got out onto the corner where there's a saloon, and then we\u000astopped to listen.
p8098
aVSame as always, the minute Terry couldn't do no\u000amore harm, he was gentle as a child.
p8099
aV"There's patriotism around all\u000aright," he says, cockin' his head toward the racket back at the\u000atheayter.
p8100
aV"It on'y needs somebody to stir it up.
p8101
aVI'll bet anybody\u000afive to one in beers that somebody gets hurt out of this before it's\u000aover," he says, as a extry loud howl and a ripple of shots busts\u000aloose fr'm the theayter, and a patrol-wagon comes ting-tingin' it\u000adown the street.
p8102
aV"I make it beer," says Terry, "because I'm thirsty."
p8103
aV"Take you and lose," says th' Engineer.
p8104
aV"Step in here and we'll pay\u000aup one of th'm now."
p8105
aVSo we stepped in there, and we stepped in sev'ral other places, till\u000awe sort of got th' habit.
p8106
aVI reckon we traveled all over Maniller\u000aafter that, and had beers with about half th' Army.
p8107
aVTh' last thing I\u000aremember, Terry had got patriotic again, an' was sayin' a po'm about\u000ath' flag.
p8108
aVThen my thoughts got to advancin' in regimental formation,\u000aand I sort of went to sleep.
p8109
aVTh' dinky little guard-mount march was goin' next mornin'--I reckon\u000ait was next mornin'--when I woke up, so I knew somethin' was wrong.
p8110
aVI reached f'r my rifle, me bein' warned for guard that day, and I\u000afound I was in th' guard-house a'ready, and Terry was poundin' his\u000aear on a bunk beside me.
p8111
aVMy head felt like a caraboo had walked on\u000ait, an' I yelled to the sentry for water.
p8112
aV"The ice-water's over'n th' corner, same as always," he says, peekin'\u000ain through th' bars.
p8113
aV"You sure ain't forgotten this quick?"
p8114
aV"What did we do?"
p8115
aVI asts him, sizzlin' down about a quart in one gulp.
p8116
aV"What didn't ye do?
p8117
aVPers'nally ye did up three of us while we was\u000aputtin' you in th' cooler here.
p8118
aVYe came home singin' in a\u000acarrermatter 'bout 3 A.M., an' Terry wanted to bring th' _cochero_ in\u000aan' kneel him in front of th' flagpole an' cut his head off.
p8119
aVYou was\u000atryin' to borry a bay'net f'r th' ceremony.
p8120
aVBut I guess you'll get\u000ato rememberin' most all you did, and some more, before th' Old Man\u000agets through with you.
p8121
aVHe's had a squad of cops _and_ an orderly\u000afr'm headquarters to call on him a'ready this mornin'.
p8122
aVFr'm what\u000athey said, I should judge you tried to bust up the little old Civil\u000aGov'ment and clean up the L.B.B.
p8123
aVDon't be bashful about th' water,"\u000ahe says.
p8124
aV"It's all f'r you."
p8125
aVWhile I was sloshin' ice-water over my head, Terry woke up.
p8126
aVWe sat\u000aon the edges of our bunks and talked it all over.
p8127
aVWe didn't feel\u000areal affectionate.
p8128
aVWe was still talkin', sort of aimless but\u000aeffective, when the guard came an' took us out to the orderly-room\u000aand lined us up in front of th' Old Man.
p8129
aV"H'm," he says, swingin' back in his chair.
p8130
aV"Do ye desire to call\u000aany witnesses to prove ye didn't do it?"
p8131
aV"No, sir," we both says quick.
p8132
aVWe'd known him f'r some time.
p8133
aV"H'm.
p8134
aVThat's lucky f'r you," he says.
p8135
aV"I don't mind havin' men try\u000ato run my guard at three in th' mornin'," he says, talkin' to the\u000aceilin' like an old friend, "nor tryin' to murder a coachman on my\u000ap'rade-ground, nor blackin' th' eye of th' sergeant of th' guard.
p8136
aVH'm.
p8137
aVYe've got to ex-pect them little things fr'm real soldiers, of\u000acourse," he says.
p8138
aV"H'm.
p8139
aVBut when I have to drive away six policemen\u000abefore breakfast who've came to arrest two of my men f'r assaultin'\u000aseveral hundred natives all to onct, I've got to draw th' line.
p8140
aVThere's eddy-toryals about them men in all th' native papers this\u000amornin', or so I am informed accordin' to th' best of my ability, and\u000ain th' _Cable-News_.
p8141
aVA brutal attack on peaceable, well-disposed\u000aFillypeeners, and on hundreds of th'm at that, is an assault to the\u000afoundations of government which I can't overlook.
p8142
aVH'm."
p8143
aV"She spit on th' flag, sir," says Terry.
p8144
aV"Th' Colonel wanted them men for a G.C.M.
p8145
aVthis mornin'," says the Old\u000aMan, "to say nothin' of what th' civil authorities want th'm for, and\u000athat's a whole lot.
p8146
aVBut there ain't been a gen'ral pris'ner out of\u000athis comp'ny for five year now, and I persuaded the Commandin'\u000aOfficer that I could attend to th' case.
p8147
aVH'm.
p8148
aVWhat do you think\u000aabout that, Casey?"
p8149
aV"Yessir," I says.
p8150
aV"H'm.
p8151
aVAnd Clancy?"
p8152
aV"Yessir," Terry says.
p8153
aV"H'm," says he, "y'r confidence in me is flatterin'.
p8154
aVI'll try not to\u000adisappoint ye," he says, and gets up an' goes limpin' round th' room\u000aon his Tientsin leg.
p8155
aVHe walks around there f'r five minutes, anyway,\u000abefore he says a word.
p8156
aVFin'lly he stops and looks out of the window.
p8157
aV"A very pretty p'rade-ground we have here, Mr. Boyd," he says to the\u000aLieutenant.
p8158
aV"Very pretty, sir," says the Lieutenant, puzzled to know what the Old\u000aMan would be carin' about parade-grounds just then.
p8159
aVHe hadn't served with him as long as me and Clancy had.
p8160
aVYou remember\u000ahow the old barracks is built, in a hollow square round a p'rade big\u000aenough f'r a regimental corral, with th' post flagstaff stickin' up\u000ain th' middle, and lookin' about three hundred foot high?
p8161
aV"H'm," says th' Captain, gazin' out of his window.
p8162
aV"Very pretty,\u000aindeed.
p8163
aVBut do you notice how the grass is growin' up between th'\u000aflagstones in the paths?
p8164
aVThat's not neat, Mr. Boyd.
p8165
aVThat's not\u000afittin' in a place where the shadder of th' Flag must fall," he says,\u000aglancin' at us.
p8166
aV"H'm.
p8167
aVThey tell me you're becomin' somethin' of a\u000apatriot, Clancy?"
p8168
aV"Yessir," says Terry.
p8169
aV"H'm.
p8170
aVAnd Casey?"
p8171
aV"Yessir," I says.
p8172
aV"That's fine," says th' Old Man.
p8173
aV"That's a pleasant surprise.
p8174
aVH'm.
p8175
aVBut I hear ye have been wastin' y'r patriotism in wild firin'," he\u000asays.
p8176
aV"It's too vallyouble to waste, 'specially in Maniller.
p8177
aVI must\u000atry to help you make it flow in a gentle, steady stream.
p8178
aVH'm.
p8179
aVIf\u000ayou let it fly in chunks, it closely resimbles annichy," he says,\u000a"'specially in Maniller.
p8180
aVH'm.
p8181
aVSentry, march these men to the p'rade\u000aand see that they pluck the grass, all the grass, between the stones,\u000atie it in bundles of fifty stalks, neat bundles, and place the\u000abundles at the foot of the post flagstaff.
p8182
aVH'm.
p8183
aVAnd, Sentry, see\u000athat after depositin' each bundle, they retire twelve paces and\u000asalute their flag before resumin' work.
p8184
aVAfter you have cleaned th'\u000ap'rade," he says to us, "I trust I shall be able to find some other\u000awork for you.
p8185
aVIf ye either of you feel y'r patriotism flaggin' under\u000ath' strain, just tell th' sentry and he will bring you in to me and I\u000awill try to revive it.
p8186
aVH'm.
p8187
aVYou understand, Sentry?"
p8188
aV"Yessir," says th' sentry.
p8189
aVHis mouth was twistin' up on him, an' th'\u000aLieutenant's, an' everybody's, but just us and the Old Man's.
p8190
aVHe\u000alooks sort of surprised.
p8191
aV"Is they any jokes around here I ain't noticed?"
p8192
aVhe says.
p8193
aV"I do love\u000aa joke.
p8194
aVH'm.
p8195
aVYou seen any, Clancy?"
p8196
aV"Nossir," says Terry, pretty sick.
p8197
aVThe sentry grinned all th' time he was marchin' us out, an' the news\u000aspread quick, and they was grins to meet us all the way.
p8198
aVAn' then\u000ath' sentry begins to guy us.
p8199
aV"You've skipped a stalk on y'r left flank, Clancy," he says.
p8200
aV"I\u000ashall have to report it.
p8201
aVAnd tie th'm in neat bundles of twelve\u000astalks, is the orders, retire fifty paces, and salute th' flag."
p8202
aV"Cut it out, Skinny," says Terry.
p8203
aV"He said bundles of fifty.
p8204
aVI\u000aheard him m'self."
p8205
aV"Bundles o' hell an' fifty paces," says Skinny.
p8206
aV"You can go an' ast\u000a_him_ if ye won't believe _me_.
p8207
aVWouldn't ye like, perhaps, to go an'\u000aast him?
p8208
aVI'll march ye in with pleasure."
p8209
aV"Have y'r laugh while ye've got a place f'r it," says Terry.
p8210
aV"I'll\u000amake y'r face over for ye, ye hyeener, when I get a chanst."
p8211
aV"Intimidatin' a sentry," says Skinny, but he shut up, far as talk\u000awent.
p8212
aVOn'y he made a bugle of his nose, an' begun to hum little\u000atunes through it, and then th' crowd begun driftin' out on th'\u000averandahs and caught on, and all you could hear was that whole damn\u000aparrot-faced battalion blowin' through their noses,\u000aUmpty-dee-he-hee-_heee_-he-he-_hee_-hum-hum-_hum_!
p8213
aVTerry and me said nothin' and picked busy f'r a while, but about th'\u000ahundre'th bundle th' hot stones and th' sun an' yesterday's beer an'\u000ath' crowd loafin' in th' cool verandahs an' ev'rything else all took\u000aholt of me to onct.
p8214
aV"You're an ornament to th' Service," I says, tryin' to crawl into th'\u000ashadder of the pole.
p8215
aV'Twas about a mile long and an inch wide.
p8216
aV"Stow y'r face," says Terry, tyin' a bundle with a thumb big as three\u000aof it.
p8217
aV"I'd enjoy tellin' you what I think of you," I says, "on'y I can't\u000athink of it all to onct.
p8218
aVHow's y'r patriotism ripplin' now?"
p8219
aVI says.
p8220
aV"Looka th' Flag, th' dear old Flag, floatin' up above y'r crazy head."
p8221
aVTerry swallers hard.
p8222
aV"Casey," he says, "I may uv let ye in f'r this,\u000abut--"  He picks up his little bundle and carries it over to th' foot\u000aof th' pole.
p8223
aVThen he falls back and salutes.
p8224
aVThen he comes over to\u000ame, an' his face was blossomin' into a grin!
p8225
aVYessir, there was a\u000ahole in them rugged features of his you could've shoved a\u000ablanket-roll into.
p8226
aV"Oh, Casey," he says, "Casey, man, if th' Old Boy\u000asoaks it to us this way f'r what we done, wouldn't ye, oh, wouldn't\u000aye just like to see what he'd a done to that theayter, if he was\u000arunnin' this little old town?"
p8227
aVAn' thinkin' of that, I grinned too.
p8228
aVCHAPTER V\u000a\u000aTHE SUPERFALOUS MAN\u000a\u000aI came back, but I am not certain that I had ever left the old temple\u000aof Tzin Piau.
p8229
aVI roused, then, but I am not sure that I had been\u000aasleep.
p8230
aVHowever it may have been, I was conscious of being there in\u000athe temple of Tzin Piau for a moment, long enough to observe that my\u000aold heathen priest, half reclining on his slab, was thoughtfully\u000afingering a hard lump in his girdle, just over the pit of his stomach.
p8231
aVBut the moment he saw me looking at him, he made an imperative little\u000agesture, and--\u000a\u000a\u000a"Tell th' Professor that other one, Casey," a husky voice commanded.
p8232
aV"_You_ know.
p8233
aVTh' day we lost th' friend o' Sly's."
p8234
aVThereupon the even, drawling, dryly humorous voice began to speak.
p8235
aVThis is what it said this time:\u000a\u000a"An' then Terry says, 'You're too skinny to fight, an' you ain't big\u000aenough to kill, an' I wouldn't feel much lonesome if you was\u000asomewheres else.
p8236
aVYou're what _I_ call superfalous.'"
p8237
aVThe voice\u000adwelt on the magnificent polysyllable lovingly.
p8238
aV"An' th' mayreen\u000ahobo, he lays his head down on th' table an' weeps some weeps into\u000ahis glass.
p8239
aVIt was empty.
p8240
aVIt always was.
p8241
aV'That's th' wye it gaos\u000awith me,' he says.
p8242
aV'I can't never myke no friends.
p8243
aVF'r twenty year\u000aI've been sylin' th' seas fr'm the North Paole to th' South, fr'm th'\u000aEast Paole to th' West, chysin meridiums fr'm wyve to wyve, lookin'\u000af'r a friend.
p8244
aVBut ev'rywhere I gaos--'\u000a\u000a"'Hell,' says Terry, 'if you feel that bad about it, we'll have one\u000amore.
p8245
aVCasey,' he says to me, '_is_ they an East Pole?
p8246
aVIt _sounds_\u000areas'nable, some way.'
p8247
aVAn' then," the voice mused blissfully, "we\u000ahad th' tamarin' cocktails, an' then we went to ride with the\u000aaccidental caraboo.
p8248
aVThat was a batty day."
p8249
aV"Ain't I never told you about that day?"
p8250
aVSuddenly the voice was coy.
p8251
aV"Oh, I don't dast to tell," it murmured.
p8252
aV"Local 23 o' th' Christian\u000aTemp'rance Union'll be gettin' after me f'r makin' it look like th'\u000aArmy still _drunk_.
p8253
aVI don't want to spread no false impressions.
p8254
aVEv'rybody knows that since th' vile canteen was took away, an' we was\u000agive a real chance to lead th' sinful life, there ain't one soldier\u000ain ten would even pass a saloon, willin'ly.
p8255
aVNo, sir," the voice\u000aremarked thoughtfully, "I don't reckon there's more'n one in twenty\u000ain th' whole Army would let a s'loon get by him, if he had to walk a\u000amile out of his road.
p8256
aV"Who this superfalous man was," said the voice, "_I_ don' know.
p8257
aVAn'\u000awhere we was, I've been tryin' to find out ever since.
p8258
aVWe started in\u000aon beer, but we switched to th' tamarin' cocktails, an' we ended in\u000ath' Lord knows what.
p8259
aVDon't you never drink a tamarin' cocktail,\u000a'nless you want Local 23 startin' a grand guard patrol across your\u000atrail.
p8260
aV"That day begun," the voice continued, "with a terrible painful talk\u000ame an' Terry had with th' Old Man.
p8261
aVIt was th' summer we laid in\u000aManiller after th' Samar campaign, an' me an' Terry an' the Irishman\u000anamed Schleimacher had that patriotic go with th' gu-gu theayter.
p8262
aVThat coincident shook the Old Man's faith in us way down to th'\u000aroots, an' f'r weeks afterwards he kep' us doin' double guard an'\u000adouble kitchen police an' stunts like that till we was all wore out.
p8263
aVSo this mornin' we bucks up an' tells him we needs some more passes\u000aan' a day off.
p8264
aV"'H'm,' says the Old Man.
p8265
aV'If I done my duty by sersiety, you two'd\u000anever get out together, less'n one was in a submarine an' th' other\u000ain a b'loon, and then I'll bet,' he says, 'you'd manage to get your\u000atrails tangled some ways.
p8266
aVH'm.
p8267
aVWho am I to butt into the stars in\u000atheir courses and get a sore head?
p8268
aVI can't keep ye in quarters no\u000alonger; y'r luck at poker is causin' too many hard feelin's.
p8269
aVAn' I\u000adon't dass to let ye out sep'rate, f'r each of ye needs th' other one\u000ato bring him home.
p8270
aVH'm.'
p8271
aVHe gives us th' passes an' then, just when\u000awe thought we was saved at last, he calls us back.
p8272
aV'How much money\u000ahave ye got, anyway?'
p8273
aVhe asts.
p8274
aV"We hates to name th' size.
p8275
aVTh' cards _had_ run favorable since last\u000apay-day.
p8276
aV"'That had ought to keep ye in fines f'r quite a spell,' he says,\u000awhen we told him.
p8277
aV'H'm.
p8278
aVGive it here.
p8279
aVI'll help ye save it.'
p8280
aV"We hands over, an' he peels two skinny little bills off them nice\u000afat rolls.
p8281
aV'I'll let ye have five apiece,' he says.
p8282
aV'That makes\u000athree dollars f'r chow, an' a dollar to hire carrermatters, an' ten\u000abeers apiece.
p8283
aVTen is all ye need.
p8284
aVY'r stummicks is only supposed to\u000ahold a pint and a half, anyhow,' he says.
p8285
aV'I'll send th' rest of th'\u000amoney over to the Adjutant's safe, where you can get at it handy\u000aafter summary court to-morrer.
p8286
aVH'm.'
p8287
aV"Poor as we was, we'd a been glad to get away, but he stops us again.
p8288
aV'Won't ye be good this once?'
p8289
aVhe says.
p8290
aV'I can't make it out,' he\u000asays, sad-like, to th' ceilin'.
p8291
aV'Here's Maniller layin' open before\u000athem, with nice long walks stretchin' out all around her.
p8292
aVAll kinds\u000aof nice long hot walks beckonin' them out among th' rice-paddies.
p8293
aVAn' th' Luneta, where they could set and look at th' ships when they\u000awas tired, and kill muskeeters.
p8294
aVAn' th' Y.M.C.A.
p8295
aVreadin'-room.
p8296
aV_An'_ th' Lib'ry.
p8297
aVH'm.
p8298
aVYet I'm mor'lly certain they'll pass all\u000athem things by on the off side, an' fetch up in some low groggery,\u000adebauchin' young Engineers and Marines an' shatterin' th' Gover'ment.
p8299
aVWhy can't my oldest soldiers ack decent?'
p8300
aVhe says, 'sos't I can take\u000asome _pride_ in th'm?'
p8301
aV"'May I ex-plain to th' Captain, sir?'
p8302
aVasts Terry.
p8303
aV'That theayter\u000a_biznai_ was an axxident.'
p8304
aV"'An axxident!'
p8305
aVsays the Old Man.
p8306
aV'H'm.
p8307
aVIf you see any axxidents\u000acomin' along to-day, give them the road.
p8308
aVThey'll get into just one\u000amore axxident,' he says to th' ceilin', 'an' they'll break my heart\u000aan' _then_,' he says, 'there'll be something noticeable doin'.
p8309
aVSomething noticeable.
p8310
aVH'm.'
p8311
aV"We seen that was no place for us, and we sneaks out like a pair of\u000acats that had got caught in swimmin'.
p8312
aV'Did you see his eye?'
p8313
aVI says,\u000awhen we was safe outside.
p8314
aV'It's up to us to walk cracks to-day.'
p8315
aV"Terry just grunts, and the silence didn't really get broken till\u000awe'd beat it down Real and was settin' on a bench in th' Luneta.
p8316
aVTerry spoke first.
p8317
aV'Any man that figures up my stummick,' he says,\u000a'at a quart and a half, has got another guess.'
p8318
aV"'That's a handsome Chink cattle-boat out by the end of the\u000abreakwater,' I says.
p8319
aV'Ain't she got graceful lines?'
p8320
aV"'Why,' asts Terry, scuffin' away at the gravel under the bench,\u000a'didn't he give us a nickel and ast f'r the change?
p8321
aVWhose money is\u000athat, anyway?'
p8322
aV"'That transport's a picture,' I says.
p8323
aV'If she was on'y a little\u000acloser, we could almost see the stripes round her smoke-stack.'
p8324
aV"'If,' says Terry, 'they was any way of makin' those dollars\u000a_stretch_, I'd paint a first coat of blood-color all over Maniller,\u000ajust to show him what I could do.
p8325
aVBut he got th' bulge on us when he\u000agot th' cash.'
p8326
aV"'Get on to the ships,' says I.
p8327
aV'He'll ast us how they was lookin'.'
p8328
aV"All to once Terry begins smoothin' the gravel back with his toe.
p8329
aV'Casey,' he says, 'they _will_ stretch!
p8330
aVThis is the day we walk on\u000aour feet and save two dollars carrermatter money.
p8331
aVIt ain't such a\u000amuch, but--an' then,' he says, 'they's the chow money.
p8332
aVI know a\u000ahash-fact'ry where we can get a plate of beans f'r a _peseta y\u000amedia_, an' beans is fillin'.
p8333
aVY'r stummick don't hold but two quart\u000aand a half, anyhow, and you don't want to overload it.
p8334
aVCome on,' he\u000asays, jumpin' up.
p8335
aV'Altogether there's about seventy-seven beers got\u000aby the Old Man.
p8336
aVCome on!
p8337
aVWe must have lost a lot of time.'
p8338
aV"'As you were,' I says.
p8339
aV'If you take me f'r a low booze-fighter like\u000ayourself,' I says, 'you're much mistaken; and besides,' I says, 'did\u000aye ever hear the Old Man talk like he did this mornin'?'
p8340
aV"'Onct,' says Terry.
p8341
aV"'An' you know what you _got_,' I says.
p8342
aV'It's up to you and me to\u000aroost high and pull up our feet, f'r if old Ma Trouble gets her claws\u000ainto us this happy day, th' Old Man is plannin' to draw cards, too,\u000aand they're a bad pair to buck.
p8343
aV_Sabe?_'\u000a\u000a"Terry seen I was right, an' that's the way we come to land down\u000athere on th' waterfront.
p8344
aVDon't ast me where it was.
p8345
aVWe walked\u000athrough about six gates in th' Walled City and come out on the river,\u000aan' took a canoe and landed somewhere way down on the other side.
p8346
aVThat's all I know.
p8347
aVThere was the place waitin' for us.
p8348
aVCaf of the\u000a400 Flags, it says in Spanish over the door, and underneath, in\u000aEnglish, Sailor's Friendly.
p8349
aV"And it was a nice friendly sort of place.
p8350
aVWe was the only ones\u000athere, and after we'd got sat down in a corner by a window, we\u000afigured we'd fooled old Ma Trouble f'r once.
p8351
aVThere warn't anybody\u000awithin a mile to lead us astray, an' we just aimed to set there an'\u000alook at th' boats on th' river till we'd had enough, and then go back\u000ato Barracks and surprise the Old Man, and make him ashamed of\u000ahimself.
p8352
aVBut it warn't to be.
p8353
aV"We hadn't been settin' there more'n half an hour, when that A.O.H.
p8354
aVsailorman Schleimacher from Cavite comes in the door, and th'\u000asorrerful lad was right behind him.
p8355
aVIt was all off then, on'y we\u000adidn't know it.
p8356
aV"'Ahoy, amigos,' says Schleimacher.
p8357
aV'Well, well, well, if it ain't\u000athe two paytriots!
p8358
aVAlways sloppin' round in beer, ain't you?
p8359
aVDon't\u000ago dilutin' your insides with that stuff.
p8360
aVHere, you,' he yells to\u000athe Malay pirate behind the bar, 'fetch along th' thought-remover f'r\u000ath' Seors.'
p8361
aV"'W'isky?'
p8362
aVasts th' pirate.
p8363
aV"'If that ain't like a Marine!'
p8364
aVsays Terry.
p8365
aV'But then you ain't got\u000aa canteen no more, either.'
p8366
aV"'No, we ain't, _dankum Himmle_,' says Sly, an' th' sorrerful\u000asailorman butts in, layin' his head down on th' table and cryin' like\u000aa child.
p8367
aV'Times ayn't what they ware,' he says.
p8368
aV'Men don't drink\u000alike they used.
p8369
aVMytes, I remember a dye in Punt' Arenas, off Tristan\u000ad'Acunha--'\u000a\u000a"'Who's y'r friend, Sly?'
p8370
aVI asts.
p8371
aV"'Damfino,' says Sly.
p8372
aV'He picked me up at th' Navy landin'.
p8373
aVSaid my\u000aclo'es smelt so salt it made his mouth water.
p8374
aVSome lime-juicer on\u000ath' beach, I reckon.
p8375
aVNo, sir, _dankum Himmle_, there ain't no more\u000acanteen.
p8376
aVWhen I think,' Sly says, 'of th' pay I've wasted aboard,\u000af'r belly-wash, but now,' he says, 'you don't hit th' beach on'y\u000aafter pay-days, an' then you've got th' money, an' you've got the\u000a_thirst_, an' Mine Gott!'
p8377
aVhe says, 'the load you can get on!
p8378
aVNo\u000acanteens in mine.
p8379
aVFill th'm up.
p8380
aVThey's one f'r you, Barnacles, if\u000ayou can keep the tear-drops out of it.'
p8381
aV"The guy sat up straight enough, soon as a drink was mentioned, and\u000awe got a good look at him.
p8382
aVTalk about y'r hoboes!
p8383
aVThat mayreener\u000alooked like he'd been trampin' it way down on th' bottom, and hadn't\u000agot around to shakin' himself and combin' the shells and seaweed out\u000aof his hair.
p8384
aV"'Well,' says Terry, when he'd took him in, 'he sure does look\u000asuperfalous to me.'
p8385
aV"The guy mops up his drink, an' lays his head down on th' table\u000aagain.
p8386
aV'That's th' wye it gaos,' he blatters.
p8387
aV'I can't never myke\u000ano friends, and so I gao chysin' meridiums over the angry wyves.
p8388
aVI\u000a_'ad_ a friend onct, to Valparaiso, as smart a 'and as ever reefed a\u000astuns'l--' he chokes up so bad he can't talk.
p8389
aV"'Good Lord, Sly,' says Terry, 'have we got to set around with that\u000aall day?'
p8390
aV"'Chuck him overboard if you want,' says Sly.
p8391
aV'He ain't mine.
p8392
aVBut\u000alet him stay, and I'll pay for his.
p8393
aVI like a crowd around to kind of\u000akeep them movin'.'
p8394
aV"'I 'ad a shipmyte onct off Comorin,' bleats th' sorrerful lad, 'but\u000a'e was lost, steppin' of th' bowsprit'--he chokes up.
p8395
aV"'Oh, well,' says Terry, 'if you feel that bad about losin' him,\u000awe'll have one more.
p8396
aVWe'll all pay f'r his rounds, Sly, if he's\u000abroke.
p8397
aVOn'y, he does look superfalous to me.'
p8398
aV"I reckon that wanderer must have felt near as bad as he looked!
p8399
aVSeemed like he'd been pretty near everywhere once or twice, an' ev'ry\u000aplace he remembered, something about it made him cry.
p8400
aVWe got ust to\u000ahim after a while, and he just sat with his head among th' glasses,\u000a'ceptin' when a drink come by.
p8401
aV"Long about noon we got to wonderin' what we'd better drink next.
p8402
aVTh' thought-remover warn't workin' to suit Sly.
p8403
aV'Th' ferry goes at\u000asix,' he says, 'an' I ain't even got a start yet.
p8404
aVLe's try an' find\u000asomethin' certain.'
p8405
aVThen th' weeper looks up.
p8406
aV"'I can't 'ope to myke no friends,' he says, eyein' us mournful, 'but\u000aI can myke a tamarin' Cocktail.
p8407
aVA little lydy down to Macassar\u000alearnt me.
p8408
aVMytes, w'en I think of that pore young girl an' the\u000a'orrible wye I lost 'er--' it took two thought-removers to get him\u000asos't he could tell th' pirate what bottles to bring f'r th'\u000acocktail.
p8409
aVThey made a bunch.
p8410
aVTh' sorrerful lad most looked happy\u000awhen he saw them.
p8411
aV"'They ayn't no tamarin's,' he says, 'but _that_ don't myke no\u000adifferunce.
p8412
aVMytes, you'd ought to see th' tamarin's at Isle o'\u000aFrance!
p8413
aVW'en I think I'll never see no tamarin's like them no\u000amore--'  On'y th' bottles saved him.
p8414
aVHe took a swig out of the first\u000aone he touched.
p8415
aVRight there th' Sorrers o' Satan lad begun to look\u000afishy to me.
p8416
aVDidn't seem like anybody'd need quite so many drinks to\u000adrown anything but a thirst.
p8417
aVBut I forgot all that when he gave me\u000ath' cocktail.
p8418
aV"'Stead of a kick it had a kind of a pull to it, that drink did, like\u000aa b'loon.
p8419
aV'Two more of them,' says Sly, settin' down his glass, 'an'\u000ath' Cavite ferry can go when it very well pleases.
p8420
aV_I_ can walk.'
p8421
aV"'If so be I _'ad_ a friend,' says th' mayreener, sort of proud at\u000ath' way we lapped them up, 'they's nothin' I'd love better'n to set\u000aall dye long mykin' tamarin' cocktails for 'im.'
p8422
aVI reckon that was no\u000alie.
p8423
aV'Mytes,' says he, 'w'en I think I'll never 'ave no real friend\u000ato myke th'm for--'\u000a\u000a"'Brace up, Bo,' says Terry, like a father.
p8424
aVTh' tamarin's had took\u000aholt that quick.
p8425
aV'Brace up, old sport.
p8426
aVWe're all friends o' your'n\u000ahere.
p8427
aVAin't that so, boys?'
p8428
aV"'_Is_ it, mytes?'
p8429
aVsays th' mayreener.
p8430
aV'_Is_ it?
p8431
aVWell, well, I\u000anever thought to 'ave _three_ friends all to onct!
p8432
aVW'en I think of\u000aall the 'undreds of shipmytes--I'll be mykin' up another, mytes.'
p8433
aV"So Barnacles, he got started makin' th'm, an' we got started\u000adrinkin' th'm.
p8434
aVSo did he.
p8435
aVI never seen a drink ack like them.
p8436
aVDidn't seem to have no real effeck, but things just moved away back\u000awhere they belonged an' let you alone.
p8437
aVAnd sympathetic!
p8438
aVSay, if we\u000acould on'y manage to throw a few of them into Local 23, we'd get th'\u000acanteen back.
p8439
aVThey sure are a funny drink.
p8440
aV'Bout th' sixth, we\u000acouldn't do enough f'r that stranded mayreener.
p8441
aVI'd forgot all about\u000ahis seemin' fishy, and me an' Terry an' Sly hung round him like a\u000abunch of old-maid aunts, givin' him drinks ev'ry time he remembered\u000aanything.
p8442
aVHe sure had a great mem'ry.
p8443
aV'Twarn't till th' middle of\u000athe afternoon it begun to show signs of givin' out.
p8444
aVAn' then he\u000athinks he wants to have a look at Maniller--sos't he could remember\u000a_that_, I reckon.
p8445
aV"His legs wouldn't quite hold him.
p8446
aV'Mytes,' he says, 'me knees ayn't\u000awhat they ware.
p8447
aVW'en I remember them trips to Kerguelen's Land, down\u000around San Fernando Fo--in them dyes no smarter 'and rove a dead-eye\u000aor 'auled a keel.
p8448
aVBut now--'\u000a\u000a"'Give him an arm, Casey,' says Terry.
p8449
aV'Can't you see he ain't as\u000ayoung as us?
p8450
aVBrace up, old sport, we'll look out f'r _you_.'
p8451
aV"So th' three of us steers th' sorrerful sailorman out onto th'\u000a_muelle_, an' there warn't a livin' soul on th' whole river front but\u000ajust the accidental caraboo!
p8452
aV_He_ was standin' hitched to a cart,\u000aright where old Ma had left him.
p8453
aV"Th' mayreener breaks down when he sees that caraboo.
p8454
aV'A buffalao!'
p8455
aVhe blatters.
p8456
aV'I ayn't seen one of them since I was a gye young\u000asheperd--fisherman, on me father's little farm in th'\u000avalleys--beaches o' Bengal!
p8457
aVMytes, lead me to th' buffalao.'
p8458
aV"'That ain't a buffalo, sport,' says Terry.
p8459
aV'Buffalos has hair.
p8460
aVThat's a caraboo, an' you don't want no part of him.
p8461
aVThey ain't\u000asafe.'
p8462
aV"''E'll not 'urt me,' says th' mayreener.
p8463
aV'Aoh, th' buffalaos I've\u000afed and watered with these 'ands in th' dear old dyes.
p8464
aVLead me to\u000a'im, mytes.'
p8465
aV"We steers him over and he falls on that caraboo's neck and cries\u000ainto his ear and blubbers some kind of talk to him: an' th' caraboo\u000awriggles his ear an' waggles his little tail an' blubbers back.
p8466
aVThem\u000atwo understood each other!
p8467
aVIt knocked me flat.
p8468
aVAll my respec' f'r\u000ath' mayreener comes back.
p8469
aV"'Ay, mytes,' he bleats, 'it mykes me young again to talk with 'im.
p8470
aVPut us up on th' cart, mytes.'
p8471
aV"'Ye can't drive him, sport?'
p8472
aVsays Terry, doubtful.
p8473
aV"'F'r years I done nothink else,' says th' mayreener.
p8474
aV'Aoh, the old,\u000a'appy dyes!
p8475
aVPut us up, mytes, an' pass us th' nose rope.'
p8476
aV"'If th' caraboo kills him,' says Terry, 'it'll on'y put th' pore old\u000afeller out of his mis'ry.'
p8477
aVSo we hists him up an' gives him th' nose\u000arope, and there he set cross-legged like a nigger, jerkin' th' rope\u000aan' talkin' caraboo-talk, an' th' caraboo goes!
p8478
aVYes, sir, th'\u000amayreener drives him up an' down like he'd been born there!
p8479
aVI never\u000aseen no other white man that could do that.
p8480
aV"'Come aboard, mytes,' he says, pullin' up.
p8481
aV'We'll tyke a little\u000aturn about th' taown.'
p8482
aV"Seems like I heard old Ma Trouble scratchin' herself somewheres.
p8483
aV'You go along an' help Ma, Terry,' I says, 'an' I'll report the\u000aaxxident to th' Old Man.
p8484
aVWhen it comes to takin' a ride with a\u000astolen caraboo an' a hayseed mayreener fr'm th' beaches of Bengal---'\u000a\u000a"'I knowed I couldn't 'ope to 'ave _three_ friends,' says th'\u000amayreener, doublin' up an' cryin' like a child.
p8485
aVIt didn't touch my\u000aheart, not hard, but Terry an' Sly was still full of tamarindy\u000afeelin's.
p8486
aV'Don't spoil th' pore old feller's fun,' they says.
p8487
aV'We'll bring th' caraboo back, so it ain't as if we stole him.
p8488
aVHe's\u000ajust borrered.'
p8489
aV"So I clumb on and we starts, th' mayreener settin' an' jerkin' th'\u000arope, and us hangin' our legs off th' back of th' wagon.
p8490
aVAnd by th'\u000atime we'd gone a ways, I begin to like it!
p8491
aVIt was somethin' new, an'\u000athen I reckon perhaps th' joltin' freshened up my tamarin's some.
p8492
aVAnyhow, th' houses moved back and made room, an' th' people on th'\u000asidewalks, givin' us a glad hand an' a merry ha-ha, sounded far-away\u000aan' soothin', and when we'd got up to Binondo bridge it seemed so\u000anatchral I wasn't even wonderin' any more why a copper didn't pinch\u000aus.
p8493
aVI don't _sabe_ that yet, but I reckon old Ma kep' them off till\u000ashe got done with us.
p8494
aV"Yes, sir, that ride went fine, till we come to th' foot of the\u000aEscolta.
p8495
aVYou know what it's like at that time of day?
p8496
aVJam full!
p8497
aVA\u000aline of rigs was standin' along each side of that narrer little old\u000astreet, and inside of them two more lines was pokin' along, opposite\u000aways, and in what was left of th' middle th' horse-cars was doin'\u000arapid transit.
p8498
aVDidn't look like you could crowd a thin dog through\u000athat mess.
p8499
aV"'Here's where we turn round, sport,' says Terry, but it was no use.
p8500
aVTh' mayreener whispers some messages down th' rope an' th' caraboo\u000aswings into th' car-tracks, and next minute there we was plowin' a\u000aroad up the Escolta, and no way of backin' out till we hit the other\u000aend, half a mile away.
p8501
aVI never felt so conspectuous in my life!
p8502
aVEv'rybody was lookin'.
p8503
aV'Tain't often they see three soldiers\u000acaraboo-drivin' up the Escolta, with old man McGinty at th' rope!
p8504
aV"We might have made it, I still think, if th' mayreener had stuck to\u000ath' job.
p8505
aVHe sure sabed caraboo.
p8506
aVBut he lays down on us.
p8507
aVYes, sir,\u000aright there he just curls up and goes sound asleep!
p8508
aV'My watch below,\u000amytes,' he says.
p8509
aV'Relieve th' w'eel,' an' he topples over.
p8510
aVSly\u000agrabs th' rope.
p8511
aV"And away we went!
p8512
aVSeems like th' caraboo knowed something green had\u000atook holt.
p8513
aVHe puts his nose down an' whoofs an' swings his head.
p8514
aVFirst wipe th' tip of a horn catches a chicken-coop wagon, an'\u000aR-r-rip!--th' spokes is out of a wheel.
p8515
aVHe swings th' other way an'\u000atakes a piece of varnish, with th' wood still on it, of a shiny new\u000avictorier.
p8516
aVSly gets mad at that!
p8517
aV"'Clear out of th' fairway, ye blinkety-blanked-blicked-zinked\u000alongshoreman,' he yells, hittin' th' caraboo a crack with the end of\u000ath' rope.
p8518
aVTh' caraboo breaks into a gallop, swingin' them horns like\u000aa scythe, and ev'ry jump Sly hands him another.
p8519
aV'Stand by to repel\u000aboarders,' he sings out.
p8520
aV'Hit th' victorier guy in th' eye if he\u000asets a foot on deck.
p8521
aVWheee-ee-e!
p8522
aVLuff up, ahead there, you're off\u000ayour course!
p8523
aVLuff up!
p8524
aVWell, _take_ it, then.'
p8525
aVZing!
p8526
aVBing!
p8527
aVOne of\u000aour wheels--they was sawed solid off a log four foot through--hits a\u000acarrermatter an' tosses it onto another, and them two piles up some\u000amore.
p8528
aV'Whee-ee-ee!'
p8529
aVSly yells.
p8530
aV'Hold her as she is!
p8531
aVDidn't carry\u000aaway nothin' that trip, did we?
p8532
aVWhee-ee-eee!'
p8533
aV"He lights in with th' rope and away we goes again, two ton of\u000acaraboo and two ton of wagon, both built low, at a dead gallop!
p8534
aVRigs\u000awas pilin' up all around us, an' horses was kickin' an' squealin',\u000aan' wheels was lockin' up an' rippin' out spokes, an' _cocheros_ was\u000acussin' in ten languages.
p8535
aVAway back I seen a mounted cop chasin' us,\u000abut Ma had him headed off in that mess.
p8536
aV"And then She sets her claws in!
p8537
aVRight ahead of us a carrermatter\u000awas streakin' it hell-bent through an open space, tryin' to get away.
p8538
aVWe could see th' feller in it leanin' forrard and whalin' th' horse.
p8539
aVBut, Lord, that caraboo'd a run down a thoroughbred.
p8540
aV"'Sheer off to starboard!'
p8541
aVSly yells.
p8542
aV'What do ye _mean_, loafin'\u000around th' channel that way, ye blinkety-bling-blanked son of a mess\u000aattendant?
p8543
aVI report ye to th' Captain of th' Port.
p8544
aVTo starboard, I\u000atell ye.
p8545
aVPort your helm!
p8546
aVHard over!
p8547
aVOh, well,' he says, 'if you\u000a_want_ it--Collision bulkheads, boys, I'll have to ram him.
p8548
aVHold\u000ahard, all!
p8549
aVWhee-eee-eeee!'
p8550
aVHe hits th' caraboo a couple more, and\u000ait seems like we go right through that carrermatter.
p8551
aVIt just fades\u000aaway.
p8552
aV'Take that!'
p8553
aVyells Sly.
p8554
aV'An' I'll report ye, besides.'
p8555
aV"An' right then, risin' up out of what had been th' carrermatter, I\u000aseen a short chunky kind of a man, with a tire hung to one ear, and a\u000ahandful of spokes stickin' out of one pocket, and a piece of\u000adashboard in one hand.
p8556
aVI didn't see him long, but I seen him awful\u000aplain.
p8557
aVIt was _Him_!
p8558
aV'Looka there!'
p8559
aVI whispers--I couldn't\u000atalk--an' Terry takes one look, an' _he_ couldn't talk.
p8560
aV"An' then th' Old Man catches sight of us, an' he stands up in th'\u000aruins and shakes th' piece of dashboard at us.
p8561
aV'H'm!'
p8562
aVhe says.
p8563
aV'H'm-mmm!'
p8564
aVThat's all.
p8565
aV_He_ couldn't talk, neither.
p8566
aV"Right there a street turns off the Escolta, an' I seen it was then\u000aor never.
p8567
aV'Sly,' I says, 'can ye turn off here to th' lef'?'
p8568
aV"'Sure,' he says.
p8569
aV'Anywheres.
p8570
aVHe's steerin' fine now.
p8571
aVWhoop-eee-eeee-ee!'
p8572
aVZing!
p8573
aVBing!
p8574
aVSly leans back on th' rope, an'\u000ath' caraboo puts his nose down, an' Whoof!--he hits that line of rigs\u000abetween us an' th' road we needed.
p8575
aVTalk about football.
p8576
aVTwo bumps\u000aand a hard swaller, an' we was gallopin' down that side street, with\u000ath' racket dyin' away behind us.
p8577
aV"'Keep him goin', Sly,' I says.
p8578
aV''Twas th' Old Man we hit!'
p8579
aV"'Mine Gott!'
p8580
aVsays Sly, and lights in with th' rope.
p8581
aVTh' caraboo\u000atries to fly, but that didn't bother us.
p8582
aVWe wouldn't a cared if he\u000ahad.
p8583
aVWe just hangs on and lets him go it.
p8584
aV"When he did stop it was in front of a s'loon!
p8585
aVFunny coincident,\u000awarn't it?
p8586
aVWe seen there was just one thing to do, an' th' mayreener\u000athinks so, too.
p8587
aVHe slep' through all that, but th' minute we was\u000asneakin' up quiet on a drink he comes to life!
p8588
aV"''As anythink 'appened, mytes?'
p8589
aVhe asts.
p8590
aVWe tells him.
p8591
aV"'Aoh,' he says, 'I do 'ope ye 'aven't 'urt me buffalao!
p8592
aVThey're\u000adillikit creachures, mytes.
p8593
aVIn the old, 'appy dyes--' he has to cry\u000ain th' caraboo's ear before he can take his drink.
p8594
aV"Don't ast me how we spent th' rest of the afternoon.
p8595
aVAst th'\u000acaraboo; he was boss.
p8596
aVWe couldn't steer him none to speak of, but we\u000acould start him goin'.
p8597
aVHe stopped himself.
p8598
aVAlways in front of a\u000as'loon, too.
p8599
aVI'd like to see th' guy that owned him.
p8600
aV"An' ev'ry time he stopped, th' mayreener would wake up an' mix a\u000atamarin' cocktail an' have a weep.
p8601
aVHis mem'ry was workin' fine\u000aagain.
p8602
aVAn' so we follered th' trail of that intemp'rate caraboo\u000athrough all th' back streets of Maniller, wanderin' on fr'm one low\u000ahaunt of vice to another till the houses moved back where they\u000abelonged again, an' th' sun got nice and hot and shiny, and even th'\u000aOld Man didn't seem to matter--much--an' we went to sleep on th'\u000acart, still wanderin'.
p8603
aV"When I woke up, Sly was gone, but Terry and th' mayreener was still\u000apoundin' their ears, and th' caraboo was still walkin', quiet, like\u000ahe was loafin' home with his dinner-pail and pipe after a hard day's\u000awork, along a road between some rice-paddies.
p8604
aVThings looked new to\u000ame and I set up and took a look.
p8605
aVWe was lost!
p8606
aVTh' sun was settin'\u000a'way over across th' paddies, and there warn't no Maniller in sight,\u000anor nothin' but just th' paddies and th' road--and us.
p8607
aVAnd I warn't\u000asure whether it was yestidday or to-morrer!
p8608
aVI felt so lonesome I\u000awoke Terry up.
p8609
aV"We set lookin' round a spell, and things begun to come back to us.
p8610
aV'Old Ma cert'nly hooked th'm in this time,' I says.
p8611
aV'Th' Old Man's\u000aheart is broke now, all right.
p8612
aVDid ye spot th' look in his eye when\u000ahe reco'nized us?
p8613
aVThat spelt G.C.M.
p8614
aVto me.'
p8615
aV"'Th' carrermatter was just an axxi--' Terry stops short.
p8616
aV'I donno,'\u000ahe says, 'but what it would be safer to desert.'
p8617
aV"'Maybe we've deserted a'ready,' I says.
p8618
aV'Lord knows how long we've\u000aoverstayed our leave.
p8619
aVI feel like I'd slep' a month.'
p8620
aV"'I've got a head, too,' says Terry.
p8621
aV'It was them tamarin' cocktails\u000adone it.
p8622
aVSwelp me if I ever drink another drink.'
p8623
aV"That hits th' mayreener.
p8624
aV'Lead me to it, mytes,' he says, sleepy.
p8625
aV'Me legs ayn't what they ware, but lead me to it.'
p8626
aV"'That's what done it,' I says to Terry.
p8627
aV"Terry looks at th' mayreener a spell.
p8628
aV'Casey,' he says, 'you're\u000aright.
p8629
aVHe done it, th' shrimp.
p8630
aVIt was him invented th' tamarin's,\u000aand _him_ st-- borrered th' caraboo, and him went to sleep on the\u000aEscolta.
p8631
aVAnd us aimin' to ack decent, an' gettin' th' Old Man to\u000asave our money for us.
p8632
aVTh' cock-eyed old cod-fish!'
p8633
aVsays Terry,\u000aeyein' th' slumberin' mayreener.
p8634
aV'I'd like to bat his head off.
p8635
aVSwelp me if ever I drink another--'\u000a\u000a"'Mytes,' th' mayreener begins, but Terry claps a hand over his\u000amouth.
p8636
aV'What'll we do to him, Casey?'
p8637
aVhe says.
p8638
aV"'Le's think,' I says.
p8639
aV"Th' caraboo was still loafin' along with his pick and shovel over\u000ahis shoulder, and we sets and looks at him, and th' mayreener, and\u000ath' paddies, thinkin'.
p8640
aVIt was gettin' pretty near dark, and 'way\u000aahead of us was some mountains th' caraboo looked to be makin' for.
p8641
aVThen th' plan come to us.
p8642
aV"'Give us th' rope, Casey,' Terry says.
p8643
aV'He might roll off 'n muddy\u000ahis cloes.'
p8644
aVThey was a coil of pack-rope on th' cart, and we takes\u000aand rolls th' mayreener all up in it and fastens him to th' cart, all\u000asafe and sound.
p8645
aVHe never yips till we're settin' th' last knot.
p8646
aV'_Three_ friends,' he says.
p8647
aV'Mytes, I never thought to 'ave--'\u000a\u000a"'Friends!'
p8648
aVsays Terry.
p8649
aV'_Friends_!
p8650
aVAin't he got a nerve!'
p8651
aV"We drops off behind and leaves him and his buffalao to jog along.
p8652
aVIt was gettin' dark, but we set down and watched them out of sight.
p8653
aVThey was passin' out of our lives slow but sure, joggin' along, him\u000aand his buffalao.
p8654
aV"'There may be ladrones in them mountains,' I says.
p8655
aV"'Ladrones,' says Terry, 'wouldn't bother _him_.
p8656
aVHe's too\u000asuperfalous f'r ladrones.'
p8657
aV"It got darker and darker, and pretty soon old Mr. Caraboo grunts up\u000aover a little rise and they was gone.
p8658
aV'Well,' says Terry, 'if he\u000aever does get back, he'll have somethin' _real_ to remember this\u000atime.
p8659
aVCome along, Casey.'
p8660
aV"So we hits th' road.
p8661
aVWe reckoned if we follered it long enough, we\u000aprob'ly strike some place.
p8662
aVSo we plugs along through th' dark.
p8663
aVWe\u000awarn't worryin' none about Schleimacher.
p8664
aVNothin' ever happens to a\u000afull-blooded Marine, anyhow, and we had other things to think about.
p8665
aV"'Did ye notice th' tire round his neck?'
p8666
aVI says.
p8667
aV'That tire'll cost\u000aus a mont' extry.'
p8668
aV"Terry grunts.
p8669
aV'Considerin' th' months we'll get anyhow,' he says,\u000adisgusted-like, 'an extry one is what _I'd_ call superfalous.'
p8670
aV"And so," the voice concluded thoughtfully, "we plugs along."
p8671
aVCHAPTER VI\u000a\u000aTHE VALLEY OF SUNSHINE AND SHADOW\u000a\u000aThe voice died away and it was still, with a breathless silence which\u000amade the beating of my heart ring in my ears.
p8672
aVIt was as though I\u000astood outside the world, in the Empty Places.
p8673
aVAnd then slowly\u000aconsciousness returned, if I had been unconscious, and I opened my\u000aeyes and found that I was no longer in that old temple of Tzin Piau.
p8674
aVI was glad of that.
p8675
aVI had grown weary and half afraid of seeing that\u000aold man who lay there on his slab of stone, looking, looking, looking\u000ainto vacancy, watching the strivings and disasters and the grimy\u000aludicrousness of his fellows, while a little flame of derisive\u000alaughter danced and flickered in his eyes.
p8676
aVHe seemed to me in truth\u000aa heathen man.
p8677
aVNow I lay in a spacious, dusky chamber, on a wide divan cushioned\u000awith softest stuff, and above me, suspended from the lofty ceiling by\u000acuriously wrought chains of silver and swaying slowly, silver lamps\u000aburned very dimly, and the swaying light and shadow of them moved on\u000athe age-blackened teak-wood of the floor and the mellowed silken\u000atapestries with which the walls were hung.
p8678
aVThe air was sweet, and\u000avery heavy, with the fumes of burning incense, and it was vibrant\u000awith the rise and fall of many distant voices, as if they spoke\u000asoftly, or prayed, perhaps, in unison.
p8679
aVIn my wonderment, I stirred a little on my couch, and from a dusky\u000acorner of the chamber a woman came swiftly forward and stood before\u000ame,--such a woman as I had never thought to behold.
p8680
aVIf every\u000aperfection of every perfect beauty men have famed could have been\u000astolen to deck one woman only, and have been blended cunningly\u000atogether by a master hand and made instinct with life, that might\u000ahave been the birth of her I looked on then.
p8681
aVA thin gold circlet glinted dully in the darkness of her hair, and\u000ashe was robed in a single garment of some thin, clinging, gauzy,\u000aprecious stuff which revealed the more fully her womanly perfections,\u000athe while it pretended to conceal them.
p8682
aVShe walked swiftly and\u000alightly, with lithe hips swaying in the way of Eastern women, and her\u000arosy feet twinkled in the swaying yellow lamplight; she came and\u000astood before me and looked down with serious, starry eyes.
p8683
aV"Where am I?"
p8684
aVI asked.
p8685
aV"And who are you?
p8686
aVA Heathen Goddess?"
p8687
aVShe laughed softly.
p8688
aV"You are in the temple of Lal," she said, "and I\u000aam a priestess of Lal."
p8689
aV"Why am I here?"
p8690
aVI asked.
p8691
aV"I do not know," she said, "but you were sent, I think, to see."
p8692
aV"What," I asked, "is that murmur of voices, as if many prayed\u000atogether?"
p8693
aV"They are praying," she said.
p8694
aV"Look and see!"
p8695
aVShe drew aside a fold of the tapestry, and I looked into the cavern\u000aof a temple.
p8696
aVAround a lofty, mystic figure other swaying lamps of\u000asilver burned, and other priestesses in shining, gauzy robes held\u000aofferings aloft.
p8697
aVAnd all the vast floor of the temple was one\u000aheaving sea of the women of the East, who knelt, and held their hands\u000aon high, imploringly, and laid their foreheads on the flagstones.
p8698
aVAnd as they knelt they prayed, and the soft ripple of their voices\u000amade all the arches of the temple murmur.
p8699
aV"What do they pray for," I asked, "so many of them together?"
p8700
aV"For fruitfulness," said the priestess of Lal softly.
p8701
aV"For fruitful\u000alove.
p8702
aVThey know that if a woman has that, she has all that the world\u000acan give her.
p8703
aVSo they pray for it."
p8704
aV"That," said I, "is the fate of women.
p8705
aVThe bitter fate, for when\u000atheir love must prove unfruitful--"\u000a\u000a"It is still love," said the priestess of Lal softly, "and sweeter\u000athan all else in life."
p8706
aVIn the dimness behind me, I thought I heard the echo of a chuckle of\u000acynical laughter, but I did not heed it.
p8707
aV"Yes," I said, "any love\u000athat's true is sweeter than all else--"\u000a\u000a"Sweeter than life itself," murmured the priestess of Lal, and\u000astarted, half afraid.
p8708
aVFor louder, more unmistakable, sounded that\u000amocking chuckle.
p8709
aVBut I did not heed it.
p8710
aVHer words had stirred old memories in me, and\u000aonce again I was wandering in the sun-flooded length and breadth of a\u000aValley of Sunshine and Shadow intermingled.
p8711
aVFar up in the northern end of Luzon the cloud-hung cordillera divides\u000ato east and west before it sinks abruptly in the sea, enclosing the\u000agreat central valley of the Cagayan.
p8712
aVA dim, far-off region it has\u000aalways been, of which the good folk of Manila spoke with vague words,\u000aas old men on the hills of Spain used to speak of Ultramar, that\u000aunknown somewhere into which their sons were forever disappearing.
p8713
aVAnd even the people of the valley did not know it.
p8714
aVAt Aparri, on the\u000acoast, where in the old days bales of tobacco were piled like houses\u000aalong the sandy streets while the shipping season lasted, the busy\u000alaborers would tell you that it all came from "up there," with a wide\u000avague sweep of the hand toward the south.
p8715
aVYou took a canoe and went\u000asouthward for days between gray forests where the parrots screamed\u000aand monkeys climbed lazily down the creepers to scoop up water in\u000atheir tiny hands, and you found Tuguegarao, the little city, sleeping\u000aon the bluffs, perched high and safe above the river; and men still\u000atold you of the wonders to be seen "up there."
p8716
aVAnd then, after lazy\u000adays and days, poling upward past endless fields of corn and tobacco,\u000ayou came to Ilagan, and the clerks in the offices of the Compaia\u000aGeneral spoke to you of great plantations to be seen "up there."
p8717
aVBut\u000aat Ilagan most men wearied of the journey, and gave up their quest\u000abefore they had gone half way.
p8718
aVThey should have persisted, for the real "up there" is the wonderful\u000aplace they dreamed of, a land of magnificent spaces, of great\u000astretches of plain and rolling hills.
p8719
aVIn every little valley is a\u000aforest where deer and wild boars and buffalo hide.
p8720
aVAnd all the\u000areaches of the river and the clear tributary mountain streams, the\u000a_pinaucanauanes_, are covered with clouds of ducks.
p8721
aVAnd everywhere\u000ais tobacco--in the fields and in the houses, and in the big,\u000aflat-bottomed boats, the _barangayanes_, on the river.
p8722
aVThere is a\u000astretch of country where it seems the rich, deep, warm soil never\u000atires of growing things--tobacco and corn and flowers and canes and\u000agrasses and bamboo--and men have called it "_La Flor de la Isabela_,"\u000athe flower of the land of good Queen Ysabel.
p8723
aVIt is a very quiet\u000aregion, but there is a charm in the broad fields, and the hot, sunny\u000aair, and the wild hunts over plain and hill, and the expeditions now\u000aand then in search of gold in the distant, purple mountains where the\u000awild men live.
p8724
aVThe valley grows upon one till one forgets the hills\u000aof Spain and the people one knew, and even the nearer delights of\u000aManila, and stays on "up there" till one passes from the world which\u000aalready has, and is, forgotten.
p8725
aVSometimes they emerged for a moment, even came down to "el Capital"\u000afor the Christmas festivities,--lean, bronzed, bearded men who\u000awandered silent through the gay crowds.
p8726
aVHow should they speak when\u000athey knew nothing of all the gossip of Manila,--the ball his\u000aExcellency was giving, and Don Fulano's promotion, and the match\u000abetween that young Diego de Tal and the General's daughter?
p8727
aVBut let\u000atwo of them meet in a caf, over the tiny glasses of cognac, and they\u000acould talk readily enough, though always in that quiet, self-retained\u000away which men of the open have.
p8728
aV"Brr-r-gh, it's chilly here; it would not be like this in the\u000avalley!"
p8729
aV--"No, they will be planting now.
p8730
aVAnd the river must be\u000arising; the young daredevils will be having great sport shooting the\u000arapids at Alcala.
p8731
aVRemember the whirlpool on the west bank?"
p8732
aV--"_Do_\u000aI?
p8733
aVHave you heard that Don Enrique will hold a great _fiesta_ on\u000aShrove Tuesday?"
p8734
aV--"Well, he can afford it, with this crop.
p8735
aVDon\u000aEnrique has covered more thousands this year than you have hairs on\u000ayour chin, _hombre_."
p8736
aVAlways the valley and the river and tobacco, and Don Enrique.
p8737
aVFor\u000aDon Enrique was their lord.
p8738
aVThe Company back in Barcelona and Madrid\u000amight own everything--the lean, silent, white men, and the brown,\u000atoiling thousands in the fields, and the boats on the river, and the\u000agreat white fortresses of warehouses--but in the valley Don Enrique\u000awas Company and King.
p8739
aVFor him they toiled and died forgotten, from\u000ahim they thankfully received their meagre wage, and when an order\u000acame signed in his heavy hand, "_Valdez y de las Vegas_," all men\u000ahurried to do his will.
p8740
aVAny one would be proud to serve such a man.
p8741
aVThere was a Valdez with every great captain that ever sailed, and a\u000aVegas keeps his hat on with the highest yet.
p8742
aVAnd since this is a\u000acommercial age, and mere family renown can count for little in the\u000abalance against hard cash, each year brought Don Enrique one hundred\u000athousand _pesos_, five hundred thousand_ pesetas_, eight hundred\u000athousand _reales_!
p8743
aV_Mira, amigo_, you could buy your bread and\u000asausage with that, eh?
p8744
aVand have something left for a bit of a present\u000afor the wife?
p8745
aVAnd then he was no make-believe ruler, this Don Enrique.
p8746
aVHe knew the\u000avalley, every day's journey of it, from lonely Cordn lying in the\u000athreatening shadows of the pass, to the latest change in the bar\u000aoutside Aparri; knew the capacity of each warehouse to the last bale;\u000aknew the shifting channel of the river, and could foretell the\u000atreacherous floods.
p8747
aVAnd he knew what each subordinate of his was\u000adoing.
p8748
aVNo one knew when to expect a visit from him, and there were\u000afew who did not dread being called to ride with him.
p8749
aVYet he would\u000adismount at the end of a long day in the saddle with as much calm\u000agrace as though he were merely returning from a canter round the town.
p8750
aVFor he was always calm and dignified and silent, as only a gentleman\u000aof Castile can be.
p8751
aVNot taciturn or insolent, or overbearing, but\u000amerely closed in himself.
p8752
aVHe treated all men--all white men, of\u000acourse I mean, for natives do not count--with quiet courtesy, and\u000amade neither enemies nor friends.
p8753
aVEven the guests who shared the\u000ahospitality of the great house at Echague knew very little of their\u000ahost.
p8754
aVIt was a house, that place at Echague, built four-square and heavy as\u000aa fort, of great blocks of sandstone, and back of it was a huge\u000awalled garden.
p8755
aVOf course Don Enrique had other houses, three of\u000athem, at Ilagan and Aparri and Manila.
p8756
aVBut he was as much a man of\u000athe open as any of his world-searching forebears, and he loved\u000afar-off Echague better than all the rest.
p8757
aVHere, when the shipping\u000awas over and the last _barangayan_ lay loaded to the water's edge\u000aabove the rapids at Alcala, waiting for the first gentle lift of the\u000arains to carry her safe down to Aparri, Don Enrique would retire with\u000aa band of chosen companions to hunt and game hard and long.
p8758
aVFew men\u000awere invited a second time, or wished to be, for with all his\u000acourtesy Don Enrique was an exacting host in the hunting season.
p8759
aVLong before dawn, the hounds would be belling in the _patio_, the\u000agreat tiled courtyard, and the sleepy guest, turning on his pillow\u000afor another nap, would hear a mighty splashing from the room of his\u000ahost, and the vicious squeals of the fiery little stallions in the\u000astables, and the clink of bits and stirrups and spears.
p8760
aVAnd before\u000athe unhappy sportsman could quite fall asleep, there would come a\u000apeal of trumpets in the haunting reveille and boys pounding at each\u000adoor: "Ready, Seor.
p8761
aVReady.
p8762
aVYour coffee is ready."
p8763
aVAnd so they\u000awere up and away in a mad rush over hill and valley in the gloom,\u000aanything but attractive to a man who had a decent regard for his neck.
p8764
aVAnd when they returned, Don Enrique would come riding at the head of\u000athe long line, grave and composed as ever, while the huntsmen were\u000aloaded down with a beautiful great buck or a boar, killed by a single\u000athrust of which any matador in Madrid need not have been ashamed.
p8765
aVThen, after the huge hunt breakfast, would come the welcome torpor of\u000athe siesta, and in the evening a mighty game, _malilla_ or monte or\u000abilliards, for Don Enrique played as he worked and rode, with a\u000acarelessness of consequences not at all pleasant to a man with a\u000adecent regard for his purse.
p8766
aVSo, one by one, the guests sailed away down the mysterious river, and\u000aleft Don Enrique alone in the great house at Echague, to be master of\u000aall he surveyed.
p8767
aVAnd there he moved about his lost world, and was\u000acapped and bowed down to, and had his courteous, imperious way, until\u000aI think he began to feel that he was really a very great man indeed.
p8768
aVAnd perhaps he was, as great as any other.
p8769
aVBut solitary grandeur has its drawbacks, even to as grave and great a\u000aman as Don Enrique; and as the summers came treading on each other's\u000aheels with their burden of endless days, Don Enrique, sipping his\u000aRioja in solitary state in the great dining-room, where the sweetness\u000aof orange-blossoms stole in through the wide windows, began to dream\u000adreams of a companion who should sit always with him of an evening\u000aacross the big, gleaming table, or come close beside him and share\u000ahis thoughts.
p8770
aVNo, Don Enrique was not thinking of a wife; he had had\u000aa wife, and "lost" her, as he told the world.
p8771
aVBut there was his\u000a"little girl," Mercedes, back in a great gray convent in Madrid.
p8772
aVHis\u000alittle girl, he called her in the letters he sent back every month,\u000afor she lived in his memory as the shy little maid he had given to a\u000asweet-voiced Mother Superior, so many years before.
p8773
aVIt was for her\u000ahe had been working all these years and piling up these princely\u000apossessions, and a look of almost womanish tenderness would come over\u000ahis proud, grave face when he thought of her.
p8774
aVThis thought of her\u000ahad sustained him in all the loneliness, and he had always dreamed of\u000aher coming as the crowning touch to his life.
p8775
aV"Sometime," said Don\u000aEnrique often to the lizards darting across the table in the evening,\u000aas lizards will, "sometime she shall come to us."
p8776
aVAnd somehow\u000asometime always lingered in the future.
p8777
aVBut at last, one evening when the odor of the blossoms hung very\u000aheavy in the damp, still air, and the thunder was muttering in the\u000apass far back of Santa Lucia, Don Enrique stopped his sipping to look\u000avery hard at the great-grandfather of all the lizards, a tremendous\u000aold fellow almost five inches long.
p8778
aVAnd the lizard returned the\u000astare with his bright, beady eyes.
p8779
aV"_Por Dis_, my big friend," said Don Enrique to the lizard, at last,\u000a"she shall come to us at once."
p8780
aVAnd if you realize what a very great\u000aman Don Enrique was, you will understand that when he began to make\u000acompanions of the lizards, even the biggest and most respectable of\u000athem, it was quite time that he sent for Doa Mercedes.
p8781
aVLetters came and went, and in the Christmas season Don Enrique found\u000ahimself in Manila waiting for the good old _Ysla de Panay_ to bring\u000ahis little girl to him.
p8782
aVMany longing hearts have followed those old\u000aships of the Spanish Mail in the days that are gone.
p8783
aVFor all this\u000awas long ago.
p8784
aVNot long as you count, perhaps, but I have seen Doa\u000aMercedes' eyes, and they told me that it happened long, long ago,\u000awhen the world was very young indeed.
p8785
aVBut the old ship did not bring Don Enrique his little girl, after\u000aall.
p8786
aVI wish you might have seen the Doa Mercedes who did come.
p8787
aVYour heart would have beaten as fast, I hope, as that of the spruce\u000ayoung lieutenant who almost let her fall as he was helping her into\u000athe launch, and retired quite as full of confusion and blushes and\u000aspeechlessness as if he had never worn shoulder-straps and a smart\u000asmall-sword, and been aide-de-camp to his Excellency the\u000aGobernador-General.
p8788
aVFor Doa Mercedes was tall and slight, with all\u000athe stateliness of her house, and her head was poised like a queen's\u000aon her slender neck, and her little, high-arched feet seemed scarce\u000ato touch the deck.
p8789
aVYet it was not the proud lady who made the young\u000alieutenant's hand unsteady--he lived and moved among proud\u000aladies,--it was the eyes of the young girl.
p8790
aVFor Doa Mercedes still\u000alooked out on the world from the shelter of her convent window, with\u000asuch a gentle, timid, inquiring smile in the depths of her great dark\u000aeyes that she was far more dangerous to the peace and happiness of\u000ahis Majesty's forces than all the natives of the Philippines, with\u000aCuba thrown in besides.
p8791
aVWhen Don Enrique saw the eyes of the stately lady who had come to him\u000ain place of his little girl, he was comforted, for so the little maid\u000awhom he gave to the Mother Superior had looked at him.
p8792
aVAnd Tia Maria\u000ahad good report to make.
p8793
aV"She is the best, dearest, kindest child in the world," said Tia\u000aMaria.
p8794
aV"She is as good as the Virgin herself, and never has a fault.
p8795
aVOnly she will not keep her feet dry; and oh!
p8796
aVDon Enrique, if you knew\u000ahow I have to work to make her take care of her complexion--"  I\u000asuppose old servants are the same all the world over.
p8797
aVSo Don Enrique received his little girl, the very finest little girl\u000ain all the world, which is not surprising when you consider what a\u000avery great man her father was.
p8798
aVWhile the two were getting acquainted, as Don Enrique put it, he\u000acondescended to share Doa Mercedes with the little world of Manila.
p8799
aVHe gave a great ball, and his Excellency danced the old minuet with\u000aher, whereat the beholders cried that the days of chivalry were come\u000aagain.
p8800
aVDoa Mercedes smiled a little, and blushed a little, and the\u000astout, red-faced old soldier led her to his stout, jolly old wife\u000awith the remark: "My dear, when you are good enough to die, here is\u000ayour successor, if--" and he dropped forty years and a dozen\u000acampaigns to make Mercedes a wonderful bow.
p8801
aV"Tush, old wives are good enough for such as you," said her\u000aExcellency bluntly.
p8802
aV"Sit down here beside me, my dear, and tell me\u000ahow you like Manila."
p8803
aV"It is very good to be with my father again," said Doa Mercedes\u000asimply, "and you are all so kind to me."
p8804
aVAnd then the young officers, who had been tugging at their fierce\u000amoustaches and settling their chins in their stocks, came tramping\u000astiffly up and begging for the honor.
p8805
aVSo it went on for several\u000aweeks, till one day her Excellency called.
p8806
aV"Valdez," said she, in\u000aher straightforward way, "are you going to marry your daughter or\u000anot?"
p8807
aV"That, madame," he replied, "depends on--"\u000a\u000a"On whether you find any one good enough for her, eh?"
p8808
aVsaid her\u000aExcellency.
p8809
aV"And there is no one, is there?"
p8810
aV"Not one in the world," he replied gravely, but with the gleam of a\u000asmile.
p8811
aVMost people smiled when that simple old lady was near.
p8812
aV"Not\u000aone in the world, madame," said Don Enrique.
p8813
aV"But marriage is not a\u000anecessity of life; my little girl and I will be happy together for a\u000atime, I hope."
p8814
aV"Love of the saints," cried her Excellency, "he is as young as his\u000adaughter!
p8815
aVHe thinks to keep the bees always from his honey.
p8816
aVLook at\u000atheir eyes; they are boy and girl together!
p8817
aVGod grant you may be\u000asuccessful, Valdez.
p8818
aVShe is a dear, sweet child.
p8819
aVBut take her away\u000ato your kingdom," she added.
p8820
aV"Take an old woman's advice.
p8821
aVThey are\u000abusy bees, and gay uniforms are unsettling for little girls who are\u000ato love only their fathers.
p8822
aVAnd, besides, I can't find an aide to do\u000aan errand for me while she's in town!"
p8823
aVSo Doa Mercedes, having had only a sip of the life most people lead,\u000apassed from the lost world of the convent to the lost world of the\u000avalley, with her proud, dainty ways, and a friendly, inquiring smile\u000ain her eyes for every one she met.
p8824
aVI suppose you and I can't\u000aunderstand how Doa Mercedes felt; one must step directly from the\u000aconvent to the world to do that.
p8825
aVBut of course her smile was\u000afriendly, for she had never known any one who was not a friend; and\u000ait was inquiring, for the world was all one great puzzle to her, and\u000ashe was interested in the multitude of people she saw doing so many\u000aseemingly hard and disagreeable and useless things.
p8826
aVOf bad things,\u000aof course, she knew nothing, except for some words in her prayers.
p8827
aVSo Doa Mercedes, young woman and little girl, looked into the world\u000awith frank, interested eyes.
p8828
aVAnd a very delightful place she found it.
p8829
aVThere was the great house,\u000awith its thick walls and heavily barred windows and big, cool, dark\u000arooms.
p8830
aVThere was the garden, with the old familiar orange and lemon\u000atrees and tinkling fountains.
p8831
aVThere were strange, sweet, new trees\u000aas well, ylang-ylang and clove and cinnamon, and a hundred other\u000acool, fragrant, snowy-blossomed things, and poincianas, and orchids,\u000aand great ferns, and palms.
p8832
aVBest of all, trained up and about her\u000awindows, were real Spanish roses, big white and pink and red and\u000ayellow fellows.
p8833
aVAnd at the far end of the garden was a\u000awide-spreading old veteran of a mango, big as a small mountain, and\u000ain its shade a little summer-house for her, almost hidden in a tangle\u000aof roses.
p8834
aVHere she used to sit through the day, embroidering or\u000areading, or dozing.
p8835
aVIt might have seemed a dull life to you and me,\u000abut then we never knew the quiet of the convent, and the peace of it.
p8836
aVBesides, she looked forward always to the evening.
p8837
aVYou never knew\u000athat either, perhaps--the coolness and delight of the tropical\u000aevening coming after the long glare of the day, when through the\u000awindows steals a fresh damp air, heavy with the scent of flowers and\u000amoist earth, and one hears the strange cries of birds and insects,\u000aand sees the big, silent, fluttering bats and the fireflies that make\u000aa living fountain of every tree; and all these but passing shadows on\u000athe background of a dim, happy, sleepy world of darkness.
p8838
aVMost of all, Doa Mercedes was interested in the creatures who worked\u000aand played in this huge new world.
p8839
aVFirst there was her father.
p8840
aVThe\u000along evenings were never too long with him, for Don Enrique cast\u000aaside all the gravity and dignity and silence, and laughed and jested\u000aand talked and dreamed with his little girl, till the grandfather of\u000aall the lizards became disgusted at the unseemly disturbance of the\u000aestablished order, and retired with an indignant flip of the tail,\u000awhich nearly lost him that brittle member.
p8841
aVThen there was good, grumbling Tia Maria, who found it hard to adjust\u000aherself to new conditions.
p8842
aV"How can one live in a country where\u000athere are no sidewalks?"
p8843
aVTia Maria mourned, "and where there are\u000amonkeys and bats--ur-gh-h--and scorpions and spiders--oogh-h!
p8844
aVSpiders big as _that_, child!"
p8845
aVcried Tia Maria, pushing out a sturdy\u000afoot from under her limp black skirts.
p8846
aVThen there were the servants, with their eternal cheery smiles and\u000acareless ways, who first revealed to Doa Mercedes that she inherited\u000athe family temper.
p8847
aVAnd the women and the little brown babies in the\u000atown, and the dull men in the fields--Mercedes wondered if it was not\u000avery hot and unpleasant to work in the fields, and so smiled most\u000akindly at them, till they forgot their sullenness and smiled back.
p8848
aVThere were the treacherous river and the great clumsy boats, and the\u000afierce-looking river-men with their knives and the bright\u000ahandkerchiefs about their heads.
p8849
aVAnd once she met some wild men in\u000athe streets--sturdy fellows with great muscles and long black hair,\u000astiff and rough as the mane of a horse, dressed mostly, to her\u000afrightened gaze, in shields and spears and head-axes and knives.
p8850
aVBut\u000awhen she smiled timidly, they responded with wide grins, and tried to\u000asell her little silver pipes and copper betelnut-boxes.
p8851
aVSo Doa Mercedes moved about, learning many things concerning life,\u000aeven in that far-off valley.
p8852
aVShe was destined to learn the greatest\u000athing of all there, but that came later.
p8853
aVI've often wished I could\u000ahave seen the stately, slender child-woman in those days, with her\u000abig, inquisitive eyes--seen her just as the Captain did, when he came\u000atearing into town to see her and nearly ran over her.
p8854
aVIt was characteristic of Captain Manuel to come that way, forty miles\u000ain four hours, when after two slow months the news of her arrival\u000apenetrated far into the mountains, where he was happily busy hunting\u000aoutlaws.
p8855
aVIt was characteristic of him to gallop full tilt down on\u000athe lady he had come to see, before he knew she was there.
p8856
aVAnd it\u000awas characteristic of him also to rein his horse back on its haunches\u000awith one tug, and sweep his hat off with a gesture that would have\u000adone honor to Quixote himself, and insist on escorting the lady home,\u000adespite the uneasy grumbling of Tia Maria, and a sudden access of\u000astateliness on Doa Mercedes' part.
p8857
aVEverything Captain Manuel did was characteristic, for he was a\u000aCatalan.
p8858
aVAnd while no one can foretell what a Catalan may do, it is\u000aalways safe to say that he will do what he pleases, and do it with\u000aall his might.
p8859
aVAnd this gray-eyed, fair-haired boy with the frank,\u000asmiling face, had chosen to play at living, thus far.
p8860
aVHe was the\u000acommander of the Guardia Civil in all the southern valley, put in\u000athat unenviable post that puzzled bureaucrats might be saved from his\u000aunbounded energy.
p8861
aVAnd he played with the bandits and outlaws and\u000asavages, purposely left them undisturbed that they might grow bold\u000aand troublesome, and then went out with a laugh and destroyed them,\u000aas you might a cage of rats.
p8862
aVWhen the fighting was over, he would\u000acome back unwearied and amuse himself with wondrous speculations in\u000atobacco, or stake his last peso on a stroke at billiards with Don\u000aEnrique.
p8863
aVThe most fascinating of all the playthings he had\u000adiscovered in his brief life was something he was pleased to call\u000alove.
p8864
aVHe played at that with his usual wholeheartedness, till a\u000ascore of girls up and down the valley were ever watching for the\u000alithe figure on the wild black horse, and more than a score of men\u000awere breathing threats of vengeance.
p8865
aVWhereat the Captain laughed\u000aboyishly, and invited the discontented to step out and settle it once\u000afor all with pistol or rifle or knife or spear or bolo or bare hands.
p8866
aVI'm sorry you couldn't have known Captain Manuel instead of merely\u000ahearing about him from me, for you may get the idea that he was a\u000agood-for-nothing young reprobate, whereas he was only a gay,\u000agood-hearted boy, dissipating his splendid strength in a hundred\u000auseless ways, just because no one had ever shown him a useful one.
p8867
aVBut he was a dangerous person, with his ready tongue and tossing\u000ahair, to come prancing before the wondering eyes of that bewildered\u000awoman-child, Doa Mercedes.
p8868
aVDangerous, I mean, to Don Enrique's\u000adreams of the future.
p8869
aVFor of course he fell in love with Doa\u000aMercedes at once.
p8870
aVHe was quite sure of that, before he had walked a\u000adozen steps with the lady, that first night.
p8871
aVWith him, to decide that he was in love was to be there; so behold\u000athe Captain, of a morning after drill, come clanking to the little\u000asummer-house, all brave in sword and spurs, to sit and regale Doa\u000aMercedes with weird tales of the little fights, till terrified Tia\u000aMaria crossed herself and peered anxiously up into the branches of\u000athe great mango, more than half expecting to see a naked head-hunter\u000athere ready to leap upon her venerable wig.
p8872
aVAnd Doa Mercedes, poor, little, stately Mercedes, watched this\u000astrange newcomer as she watched all others, but with a shade more\u000ainterest, for she felt that she understood him.
p8873
aVThe frank, friendly\u000asmile in his eyes seemed so exactly what she felt to all the world.
p8874
aVSoon she began to find his presence a welcome relief to the length of\u000athe days, and missed him when he did not come.
p8875
aVDon Enrique should\u000ahave taken care then.
p8876
aVBut Don Enrique was careless.
p8877
aVIn the first\u000aplace, it was rather a strenuous undertaking to keep Captain Manuel\u000aaway from where he chose to be.
p8878
aVAnd in the second place, any fear\u000athat he could awaken the heart in Doa Mercedes was absurd.
p8879
aVHe was a\u000apenniless youngster, without a "de" or an "Y" or a "Don" to his name,\u000aand she was Doa Mercedes, a Valdez and a Vegas; and, furthermore,\u000ashe had him, Don Enrique, to fill her every want.
p8880
aVSo Don Enrique\u000asmiled and jested and talked and dreamed of an evening in the great\u000adining-room, and was very happy with his little girl.
p8881
aVAnd Captain\u000aManuel laughed and joked and sang in the little summer-house of a\u000amorning, and was in heaven, or thought he was, which, after all,\u000aamounts to just as much while it lasts.
p8882
aVAnd Doa Mercedes looked on\u000athem all with friendly, inquiring eyes.
p8883
aVAt last one morning, the Captain was holding a skein of silk for her\u000ato wind.
p8884
aVTia Maria had fallen into an uneasy doze through very\u000aexcess of terror at the latest tale.
p8885
aVSeveral times their eyes met\u000awhen the skein was tangled--such a tiny skein of golden-yellow silk\u000ato mean so much.
p8886
aVAnd each time Doa Mercedes became more stately and\u000amore timid, while the Captain's cheeks burned like a boy's.
p8887
aVTheir\u000atalk died away to broken sentences, and then the hush of noontide lay\u000aover the great, hot, fragrant garden, and only the heavy droning of\u000abees among the roses broke the stillness.
p8888
aVDoa Mercedes put out a\u000atrembling hand to clear another snarl, and--Tia Maria popped bolt\u000aupright in her chair.
p8889
aV"Blood of all the blessed saints!"
p8890
aVshe cried.
p8891
aV"What was that I heard?"
p8892
aVAnd she peered up into the gently stirring\u000abranches of the old tree, and made ready to flee.
p8893
aV"It was a wild man, perhaps," said the Captain, with a tremulous\u000alaugh; and Doa Mercedes took up the conversation quite as composedly\u000aas if she had lived in the world all her life.
p8894
aVBut when the Captain\u000awas going, she murmured: "You must tell Don Enrique for me."
p8895
aVOf course he told Don Enrique at once, and of course Don Enrique was\u000aquite astonished at the commonplace thing which had been going on\u000aright under his patrician nose, and quite scandalized, and very\u000apositive, in his grave, courteous way, that all such thoughts must be\u000adropped at once--positive as only a great man who ruled a valley\u000acould be.
p8896
aVAnd Captain Manuel was quite sure that he loved the lady,\u000acould not live without her, would win her in the end--sure as only a\u000abig, impetuous heart like his could make a man.
p8897
aVSo Don Enrique\u000apolitely regretted that he could not have the honor of receiving the\u000aCaptain in his home again, and the Captain bowed very low and clanked\u000aout under the big, gloomy arch of the gateway for almost the last\u000atime.
p8898
aVNow I doubt if either of them had really been in love.
p8899
aVBut they were\u000aready to grow into it, and forced separation has been a fertile soil\u000afor propagating love, ever since the world began.
p8900
aVThe little girl\u000awas very dutiful and sat with her father every evening, merry and\u000asmiling and tender as ever; but across the big, gleaming table she\u000amay sometimes have seen a vision of a longing, boyish face.
p8901
aVDon\u000aEnrique had seen visions across that same table, you remember.
p8902
aVPerhaps in time Doa Mercedes might have watched the vision till it\u000acame to mean more to her than the great house and the family name and\u000athe love of her father himself.
p8903
aVAnd the Captain fell into a very fever of devotion, and for more than\u000aa month he stayed in his quarters, writing Catalan love-songs on the\u000aedges of commissary returns, and gazing gloomily at his sword and\u000aspurs.
p8904
aVBilliards and cards knew him no more; the black horse fretted\u000ain the paddock and looked unsayable things at the frightened groom;\u000athe brown-skinned girls of the countryside lived in peace and amity\u000awith their reconciled lovers.
p8905
aVPerhaps the Captain's devotion might\u000ahave endured, and all that splendid energy of his might have been\u000aturned to good and useful things at last.
p8906
aVAll that is mere speculation.
p8907
aVWe shall never know, and it does not\u000amatter.
p8908
aVThe day of Spain was passing in the Islands.
p8909
aVOutside there\u000ahad long been rumors of ugly things; sudden, secret death and\u000asmoldering insurrection, killing of priests and burning of towns and\u000aterror-stricken people everywhere.
p8910
aVNow at last they penetrated even\u000ato the valley,--stories of raids on distant _haciendas_, and\u000aassassinations on lonely trails, and a little army massed in the\u000afoot-hills back of Santa Lucia.
p8911
aVIt was as if a chill wind swept over\u000athe sunny plains and rolling hills and busy, treacherous river, and\u000anone of the lean, bearded, sun-bronzed men could tell whence it came.
p8912
aVDon Enrique, that great man, did not heed it.
p8913
aVWhen news came of a\u000awondrous great buck seen near Ascaris, he insisted on setting out to\u000acapture it.
p8914
aV"A bit of venison is what you need to put the roses\u000aback," he said to Doa Mercedes, standing tall and strong in his\u000aboots, and tapping her cheek with his gauntlet.
p8915
aV"Insurrection!
p8916
aVNonsense, _chiquita_, it is only the talk of these poor, foolish\u000aIndians.
p8917
aVI wave my riding-whip at them, and phooh!"
p8918
aV--he blew a quick\u000abreath, kissed her, and rode off in the gray chill of the morning.
p8919
aVBut toward evening a man dragged himself in--old Canute the huntsman,\u000acut and bleeding--and told Doa Mercedes how the party had been\u000aambuscaded and had fought its way to a thicket of bamboo, and how\u000athey must have help or perish.
p8920
aVWhile she stood half stunned and helpless, came Captain Manuel,\u000auncalled, and said simply: "I am going to him, Doa mia."
p8921
aVHe did not\u000atell her that all the country was up in arms, that he was going to\u000ahis death.
p8922
aVI doubt if he even thought of that, as he stood before\u000aher and saw her big, beseeching eyes.
p8923
aVAll the carelessness and\u000alightness of his nature fell away, as he stood before the lady for\u000awhom he was to die.
p8924
aVAnd yet, as he turned to go, a bit of the spirit\u000aof old Spain stirred in him, and he bent toward her.
p8925
aV"I kiss your\u000ahand, my lady," he said.
p8926
aVThen Doa Mercedes understood, and with a little cry she flung\u000aherself into his arms.
p8927
aVOne little moment she knew that all the\u000asecret of life was hers--and then she took a white rose from her hair\u000aand gave it to him.
p8928
aV"My colors!"
p8929
aVshe said, and none of her ancient\u000ahouse had ever stood more proud and stately to watch her knight go\u000aout to battle, and none ever went more steadfast and strong and\u000alovable than that boy of the common folk of Catalua.
p8930
aVThere's not much more to tell, of course.
p8931
aVThe Captain found Don\u000aEnrique, and at dawn they went out together, with their men, in one\u000aof those deeds of splendid courage which once made their country\u000amistress of half the world.
p8932
aVBut a poor, foolish Indian, with a\u000awell-cleaned Mauser and a firm rest at five hundred _metres_, and the\u000awrongs of three centuries to right, stopped their poor, proud,\u000aSpanish hearts.
p8933
aVThe few men who were left brought them back to Doa Mercedes,\u000astanding pale and stately in the great courtyard, and on Don\u000aEnrique's breast they found a miniature which might have been his\u000alittle girl, but was not, and on the Captain's a white rose dabbled\u000awith red.
p8934
aVAs I said, all this happened when the world was young.
p8935
aVI know, for I\u000arode through Echague once, and I saw Doa Mercedes' eyes.
p8936
aVThey are\u000afriendly and inquiring still, but the smile comes from an old, old\u000aheart.
p8937
aVAnd yet, after all, is it so bad?
p8938
aVDon Enrique and the\u000aCaptain are very quiet indeed in the great garden, and perhaps the\u000avalley is none the less happy that their imperious wills are quiet,\u000atoo.
p8939
aVThe river still runs, and the boatmen sing on its long reaches,\u000aand the hot sunny air floats over field and hill and forest with\u000avivifying strength, and you would hardly know that they were gone.
p8940
aVPerhaps Don Enrique might never have been reconciled.
p8941
aVPerhaps the\u000aCaptain might have changed.
p8942
aVThere are a dozen perhapses.
p8943
aVAnd now\u000aDoa Mercedes has the great house--after all it is not unlike a\u000aconvent in its quiet and its peace--and the memory of two strong men\u000awho loved her until death.
p8944
aVCHAPTER VII\u000a\u000aWHAT OKIMI LEARNED\u000a\u000aSlowly the picture faded, and somewhere near me I heard the priestess\u000aof Lal sobbing.
p8945
aV"You saw it, too?"
p8946
aVI asked.
p8947
aV"Yes," she said, "I saw it too.
p8948
aVAnd oh!
p8949
aVI'm sorry for her, but it\u000awas better that than nothing.
p8950
aVFar better that than nothing!
p8951
aVThere's\u000anothing else in life like love--"\u000a\u000aSuddenly, in the solemn hush of that dim, lamp-lighted room, I heard\u000aa chuckle of cynical amusement.
p8952
aVThe priestess of Lal heard it, too,\u000aand faced me with beautiful, blazing eyes, and flaming cheeks still\u000adamp with tears.
p8953
aV"Did you dare to laugh at me!"
p8954
aVshe cried.
p8955
aV"I could kill you.
p8956
aVDid\u000ayou _dare_?"
p8957
aV"No," I said.
p8958
aV"I believe, as you do, that love--"\u000a\u000aAgain that rustle of malicious laughter crept across the\u000aincense-laden air.
p8959
aVIn the eyes of the woman a sudden terror showed,\u000aand she shrank close to me.
p8960
aV"Who is it laughs?"
p8961
aVshe whispered.
p8962
aV"This is not the first time I've\u000aheard it, when I spoke and thought of love.
p8963
aVIt--frightens me.
p8964
aVBut,"\u000ashe cried with sudden energy, "I _will_ believe that love is\u000aeverything.
p8965
aVIf it is not, what becomes of us poor women?
p8966
aVAre our\u000alives all wasted on a dream?"
p8967
aV"I do not know what it is that laughs," I said.
p8968
aV"Some evil influence\u000aseems to dog my path, that turns all the smiling face of the earth to\u000adust and ashes.
p8969
aVBut do not doubt, and I will not.
p8970
aVTrue love is the\u000aone eternal thing in our mortal lives.
p8971
aVIt is greater than we are\u000aourselves, and it is never wasted--"\u000a\u000aSuddenly the flames, in their silver sockets, sucked upward once and\u000athen were gone, and we were left in inky darkness, the priestess of\u000aLal and I, cowering close together like two frightened children,\u000awhile ghostly garments rustled all about us, and ghostly voices\u000awhispered, and we saw what Okimi learned.
p8972
aVThe girl Okimi is the daughter of parents who are poor and so honest\u000athat they sold their daughter for money to pay their debts, just as\u000asoon as it was possible.
p8973
aVThe girl went down to the ship and away\u000aacross the radiant Inland Sea without shame, and without a murmur at\u000aher fate, for such things happen so often that the gods have no time\u000ato listen to complaints.
p8974
aVThat is how she came to be living in a strange land, in a gilded\u000ahouse in a garden where big paper lanterns glow in the shrubbery\u000aevery night.
p8975
aVOkimi soon discovered the garden, and learned to be\u000afairly happy there in her placid, childish way, tickling the\u000agold-fish in the fountain basin with long blades of grass, and\u000alaughing to see them dart away, playing with the monkeys, and\u000acrooning little flower-songs to the big, unfriendly ylang-ylang.
p8976
aVIt was all very well while the day lasted.
p8977
aVBut when the evening\u000ashadows began to gather in the corners, Mama San would call from the\u000abalcony, "Now, girls!"
p8978
aVOkimi tried to be very obedient, and when Mama\u000aSan called she would rush away as fast as she could, with her funny\u000alittle toed-in steps, to dab on the rouge and put on the silken\u000akimono and smile bravely over the samisen.
p8979
aVMama San said men like a\u000agirl who smiles and sings and is gay, and even Okimi was wise enough\u000ato know that the more men liked her, the sooner she would be free and\u000aback in sight of dear old Fuji.
p8980
aVThat's what she always called him,\u000a"dear old Fuji," a rather familiar name to give to a sacred mountain,\u000abut then Okimi was a little girl, and big Fujiyama had never seemed\u000ato mind.
p8981
aVOkimi never knew just how it came about that the girls, Haristo and\u000aGhana and the rest, began to laugh at her and to say things in the\u000aEnglish she found it so hard to understand.
p8982
aVShe just managed to make\u000aout these words: "Okimi San got sooeetart!
p8983
aVOkimi San got sooeetart!"
p8984
aVShe ran to find her oracle, Mama San.
p8985
aV"What is this 'sooeetart'?"
p8986
aVshe demanded.
p8987
aV"It is a foreign custom," said Mama San.
p8988
aV"These white men, they\u000abecome as mad.
p8989
aVIt is one girl always, and if she speaks with another\u000athey are very 'jalous' and wish to fight."
p8990
aV"Oh, I know!"
p8991
aVcried Okimi.
p8992
aV"It is like their honorable marriage."
p8993
aV"It is not like the marriage of Nippon.
p8994
aVThey have somewhat that they\u000acall 'love.'
p8995
aVThey say always, 'I love yeeoo, sooeetart.'
p8996
aVI have\u000aheard them.
p8997
aVWhen I was young like you, I had many sooeetart," said\u000aMama San, puffing complacently at her cigarette.
p8998
aV"And what is this thing 'love'?"
p8999
aVOkimi persisted.
p9000
aV"Pshaw, child, how should I know?
p9001
aVIt is some madness inside one; we\u000ahave it not in Japan.
p9002
aVRun and play with the monkeys."
p9003
aVSo Okimi went and played with the monkeys, and asked them what love\u000ais.
p9004
aVShe was a curious little thing.
p9005
aVBut they only grinned horribly\u000aat her and chattered, and the goldfish did not seem to know, and the\u000aylang-ylang blossoms were silent about it, though she sang them her\u000avery prettiest song.
p9006
aV"Foolish flowers," she cried, "you do not know our tongue," and she\u000aflung them in the fountain basin and set the bright fish scurrying.
p9007
aVAnd still the girls, the tired-looking, laughing little girls, would\u000acry, "Okimi San got sooeetart!
p9008
aVOkimi San got sooeetart!"
p9009
aVAnd still\u000aOkimi San went on asking the trees and the flowers and the birds,\u000a"What is sooeetart?
p9010
aVWhat is this 'love'?"
p9011
aVAnd they never could\u000aunderstand and answer.
p9012
aVEven Buddh would not tell her, even black, ugly, good little Buddh,\u000awho sat cross-legged above the pyramid of dough-cakes on the dresser\u000aand protected Okimi.
p9013
aVBuddh would not tell her, though she asked him\u000atime and time again, with her head on the floor at his feet, as\u000ahumbly as could be.
p9014
aVSo one night when the man they called Sweetheart came, Okimi asked\u000ahim.
p9015
aVHe looked blank at first, and she was afraid he was not going\u000ato tell her.
p9016
aVThen suddenly he gathered her up in his arms, and\u000akissed her on her laughing eyes and pouting lips and little, dimpled\u000achin.
p9017
aV"That is love," said he.
p9018
aVNow Okimi had long been practising that honorably foolish and\u000adisgusting foreign habit, the kiss.
p9019
aVShe tried hard, for Mama San,\u000athe oracle, said men like girls who know how to kiss.
p9020
aVGenerally she\u000ashut her eyes very tight and screwed up her lips and held her breath.
p9021
aVBut this time, when Sooeetart said, "This is love," and his lips\u000atouched hers, she seemed to have no breath at all, and her eyes\u000astayed open and looked right into his, and--Okimi wriggled out of\u000aSweetheart's arms and ran away as fast as she could with her funny\u000alittle toed-in steps.
p9022
aVAnd all the girls together couldn't pull her back.
p9023
aVBut next morning\u000ashe gave the juiciest orange to dear, ugly little Buddh who sat\u000across-legged in the corner and protected her.
p9024
aVShe called Sweetheart "Jiji" after that.
p9025
aVJiji means old man, but if\u000ayou know how to say it just right, it can mean dearest, littlest,\u000abiggest, belovedest old man.
p9026
aVOkimi said it that way.
p9027
aVJiji made a most delightful playmate, after Okimi had learned not to\u000abe afraid of him.
p9028
aVHe was so big; when he knelt on a cushion, one of\u000ahis feet went under the bed, and she had to move a chair to make room\u000afor the other.
p9029
aVAnd he was so strong, and insisted on carrying her\u000aall about the house in a sort of triumphal procession, whereat the\u000amonkeys and parrots chattered and shrieked in amazement, while Okimi\u000akicked him in the ribs and cried "Gid ap" in Japanese, and swore at\u000ahim innocently in Tagalo, the way she had heard the native coachman\u000atalk to his horses.
p9030
aVSuch romps as they used to have.
p9031
aVBut she liked the quiet hours best, when they were alone together,\u000aand the samisen waked the echoes of a thousand sorrows.
p9032
aVIt was sweet\u000ato hear the echoes of the sorrows, and then look into Jiji's eyes.
p9033
aVAnd then he had to see if anything had changed since his last visit,\u000aand they would make an important tour of inspection, hand in hand.
p9034
aVThere was the little pot of iris which she was trying so hard to make\u000alive in this strange land.
p9035
aVAnd the wrinkled old dwarf of a\u000apine-tree, not much taller than Jiji's longest finger.
p9036
aVAnd there was\u000aBuddh, who sat behind the little bowl of blazing oil and protected\u000aOkimi.
p9037
aVOften, after Jiji was asleep, she would creep out very softly\u000ato kneel and say, "Dear Buddh, mighty Buddh, now we know what love\u000ais.
p9038
aVWe thank thee for telling us."
p9039
aVAnd ugly little Buddh, sitting\u000athere cross-legged in the tiny, flickering spot of light, smiled back\u000aat her most knowingly.
p9040
aVAll the girls liked Jiji.
p9041
aVHe was always making them laugh, and\u000alaughter is a pleasant thing.
p9042
aVSomehow the food wouldn't stay on his\u000achop-sticks, and so one or two of them must come to his relief.
p9043
aVThey\u000awould pick out the snowiest grains of rice for him, and the juiciest\u000abits of fish and seaweed, and the fattest of the little green plums.
p9044
aVSometimes they would get to racing with each other, and pop things\u000ainto Jiji's mouth till he could only hold up his hands and shake his\u000ahead in mournful protest.
p9045
aVThen, when he got his breath, he was as\u000alikely to say "_Doyo mashi tashi_" as anything.
p9046
aVJiji was very proud of his accomplishment in the language.
p9047
aVHe had\u000aone phrase which he used as often as he could.
p9048
aVIt was "_Sayonara de\u000agans_," and it always made the girls laugh very heartily, for they\u000adidn't know what "_de gans_" meant.
p9049
aVJiji didn't know either, so when\u000athey laughed he thought he had made a joke in an unfamiliar tongue,\u000aand he laughed, too.
p9050
aVThen they would all laugh, and Jiji would go\u000aswinging down to his carriage with his big strides, and the girls\u000awould all crowd to the window and call after him, as he drove away,\u000a"_Sayonara_!
p9051
aVGoo' bye, Jiji San.
p9052
aV_Sayonara de gons_!"
p9053
aVOkimi didn't run to the window with the rest, but hid in her room,\u000athose days, and was very busy.
p9054
aVA festival of her people was\u000aapproaching, and she had determined to make for Jiji the very\u000abeautifullest kimono that ever was known.
p9055
aVFrom Kobe came a bolt of\u000asilk, the wonderful crepe which makes you catch your breath when the\u000aman unrolls it.
p9056
aVBlue, it was, and softly blended from the deep,\u000aquiet shadow of the Inland Sea to the tint that trembles in the\u000athroat of an unfolding iris, and the artist-weaver had even caught\u000athe hint of color which rests on Fujiyama when the springtime days\u000aare near.
p9057
aVAnd over all he had scattered handful after lavish handful\u000aof snowy cherry-blossoms.
p9058
aVOkimi hung over it for many days, not daring to cut a thing so\u000aprecious.
p9059
aVAnd she called in her dearest friend, sweet-faced little\u000aMisao San, and they held it up to the light and draped it about them,\u000aand fondled it, and feasted their starved little souls on it.
p9060
aVWhen at last it was cut, Okimi would sit on the floor to sew while\u000aMisao sang to her.
p9061
aVOne day Misao happened to remember an old, old\u000asong.
p9062
aVIt goes something like this:\u000a\u000a    White is all the cherry-garden\u000a  In the moonlight there below;\u000a  Poor lost petals fluttering downward\u000a    Cold, like snow.
p9063
aVI am lost as are the blossoms--\u000a  My heart is full of lonely pain--\u000a  Come for me, dear lord my master\u000a    E'er the cherries bloom again.
p9064
aVMisao sang, and Okimi, listening, gazed at something very far away.
p9065
aVAnd she gathered up the pictured blossoms, and pressed them very\u000asoftly.
p9066
aVMisao, looking as fluffy and gentle and bewildered as a\u000akitten, let the samisen fall with a crash, and Okimi came back to her.
p9067
aV"Okimi, dear," said Misao timidly, "do you know what love is?"
p9068
aV"Love?"
p9069
aVechoed Okimi.
p9070
aV"Why, love is--"  She went over to the window.
p9071
aV"Look, Misao San, the iris will surely blossom soon.
p9072
aVHere is a bud.
p9073
aVLove is--and see, the so-strong little pine-tree has sent out\u000athree--four--six sharp new needles!"
p9074
aVShe patted him gently.
p9075
aV"Love--why, love is everything."
p9076
aV"Can you see it?"
p9077
aVasked dreamy, practical little Misao.
p9078
aVOkimi looked at the swelling iris, and the pure, delicate\u000acherry-blossoms on the silk, and Buddh, sitting cross-legged above\u000ahis dough-cakes.
p9079
aV"Yes," said Okimi, "you can see it everywhere."
p9080
aV"Can you feel it?"
p9081
aVThe breeze came creeping in, sweet with the scents of the green\u000aworld, and stirred Okimi's sleeve.
p9082
aV"Yes," she answered, "everywhere you feel it."
p9083
aV"And hear it?"
p9084
aVasked Misao, wondering.
p9085
aVA cock crowed bravely in the yard, and there came a burst of distant,\u000achildish laughter.
p9086
aV"And hear it everywhere," said Okimi, and she began to hum: "White is\u000aall the cherry-garden."
p9087
aV"This love must be a strange thing," said Misao sleepily, curling up\u000aon the cushions.
p9088
aV"I do not understand it.
p9089
aVWhy cannot I see it, and\u000ahear it, and feel it, if it is everywhere?"
p9090
aVSo Okimi hid in her room and sewed away, day after day, till she\u000asewed a hole into the end of her little pink finger.
p9091
aVJiji San\u000adiscovered it and demanded an explanation.
p9092
aV"It is nothing," Okimi answered.
p9093
aV"I am just making a worthless gift\u000afor thee.
p9094
aVSoon it will be the New Year's of Nippon, and it is a\u000acustom to bring gifts."
p9095
aV"What gift shall I bring for thee?"
p9096
aVJiji asked.
p9097
aVOkimi made a wrinkle come in her forehead before she could answer\u000athat question.
p9098
aV"I think," she said at last, "I think I should like a\u000amonkey."
p9099
aV"But there are many monkeys already," Jiji objected.
p9100
aV"Chungo pinches me, and Bungsaksan is very dirty," Okimi answered\u000agravely.
p9101
aV"I want a monkey all my own.
p9102
aVJust a very little monkey,\u000alittle as that--"  She held out her absurd little hand, no bigger\u000athan a baby's.
p9103
aV"I could talk to him when you are not here."
p9104
aV"Child," Jiji promised laughingly, "you shall have a monkey little\u000aenough to go climbing about our pine-tree."
p9105
aVWhen New Year's came, Okimi was busy as could be.
p9106
aVThere was the\u000a"Christmas-tree" to make, a bare branch hung from the ceiling.
p9107
aVIt\u000atook a long time to tie the fluttering strips of red and gilded paper\u000aon all the twigs, and fasten the tiny white storks in their places.
p9108
aVThen there were new dough-cakes to be made for Buddh, and his bowl to\u000abe filled with special, perfumed oil.
p9109
aVAnd she must hunt for the very\u000asweetest spray of ylang-ylang, and go to buy an orange.
p9110
aVHe fared\u000avery well that day, the good little Buddh who sat cross-legged in the\u000acorner and smiled back at Okimi.
p9111
aVWhen all that was finished, and Misao San had done her hair and she\u000ahad dressed in her gayest and laid out the new kimono, done at last,\u000afor Jiji, it was dusk and she had not long to wait, there in the\u000ahappy, expectant silence.
p9112
aV"Here is thy monkey," Jiji said.
p9113
aVHis voice was strained, but Okimi\u000adid not notice it.
p9114
aVShe was busy with the frightened, clinging, furry\u000athing.
p9115
aV"I cannot thank thee," she said.
p9116
aV"Here is an insignificant gift I\u000ahave made for thee.
p9117
aVPut it on."
p9118
aVJiji fingered the soft folds of the kimono nervously.
p9119
aV"Not now," he\u000asaid.
p9120
aV"I have to go now."
p9121
aV"What, on our night?"
p9122
aVcried Okimi.
p9123
aV"It is well," she added bravely.
p9124
aV"Thou wilt return after a little--be still, little brown one, I will\u000anot hurt thee--and we will eat then.
p9125
aVMama San gave me a beautiful\u000achicken for us.
p9126
aVShe is very good to me."
p9127
aVJiji grew still more nervous.
p9128
aV"Okimi ca," he said at last, "I--well,\u000athe Regiment sails to-morrow."
p9129
aV"Sails?"
p9130
aVOkimi repeated dully, sliding to the floor.
p9131
aV"To America," Jiji explained.
p9132
aV"The Regiment is ordered home, and I\u000amust go with it.
p9133
aVI am a soldier."
p9134
aV"Oh," said Okimi.
p9135
aVHer face, as she huddled there on the floor, was\u000ahidden under the gay pink lining of her sleeve.
p9136
aV"America?
p9137
aVIs it--is\u000ait far to America?"
p9138
aV"Very far," he answered.
p9139
aV"Oh," said Okimi.
p9140
aVThe monkey tugged at her sleeve, and she raised\u000aher head a little.
p9141
aV"It does not matter," she said sturdily.
p9142
aV"Very\u000asoon now I shall have bought myself from Mama San.
p9143
aVI shall be free,\u000aand I will come to thee.
p9144
aVI will go anywhere for thee, so it does not\u000amatter--much.
p9145
aVPut on thy kimono."
p9146
aVJiji's nails were cutting into his palms and he did not know it.
p9147
aV"Thou canst not come, Okimi.
p9148
aVIn America I--I--" there are some\u000athings it's hard to say, even to a broken plaything.
p9149
aV"I am married\u000ain America."
p9150
aV"Oh," said Okimi.
p9151
aVShe gave the monkey a little push and he went\u000ascuttling under the bed, with shrill cries of alarm.
p9152
aV"But, oh, my\u000abeloved, let me come to thee!
p9153
aVI will be her servant.
p9154
aVLet me but\u000acome.
p9155
aVShe will not care.
p9156
aVIn Nippon are many who live so."
p9157
aV"In America," said Jiji, "they do not understand.
p9158
aVYou cannot come,\u000aOkimi.
p9159
aVIt would ruin me."
p9160
aVThen Okimi did what all her sisters of the East, and some not of the\u000aEast, have learned to do.
p9161
aVShe bowed her head and said very quietly:\u000a"Thou knowest what is best for thee.
p9162
aVIt shall be so."
p9163
aVThe little monkey, in the silence, poked out his head and looked up\u000aat big Jiji with a quick, silent grin, as a frightened monkey will.
p9164
aVAnd Jiji, looking down at the gay rumpled figure at his feet, said\u000asomething that sounded like "Godamit."
p9165
aVThen he cleared his throat\u000avery harshly.
p9166
aV"_Sayonara, Okimi ca_," he muttered.
p9167
aV"_Sayonara de\u000agans_," and he laughed unsteadily as he went out.
p9168
aV"_Sayonara_, Jiji San," said Okimi.
p9169
aVFor a long time she lay quite still.
p9170
aVSo long that the frightened,\u000acurious monkey crept out to look about him.
p9171
aVHe stretched out his\u000aclaw-like hand and plucked inquiringly at the gay bundle on the\u000afloor.
p9172
aVOkimi did not stir, and he drew back his lips in a nervous\u000agrin.
p9173
aVHe made a little rush and grinned back inquiringly at the\u000abundle, another and another, and took heart.
p9174
aVThe flame attracted\u000ahim, and he scrambled to the dresser and stood face to face with\u000aBuddh.
p9175
aVHe jumped back with his grin of frightened surprise, but\u000aBuddh did not even deign to look at him.
p9176
aVAfter a moment he sidled\u000acloser, glancing with quick hard eyes now at the bundle, now at the\u000agod.
p9177
aVAt last he stretched out his tiny brown hand and touched\u000aBuddh's knee.
p9178
aVHe dipped a wee finger in Buddh's perfumed oil, and\u000atasted it.
p9179
aVThen he dipped in both hands and splattered, as you have\u000aseen a baby in its bath, and grinned up maliciously, ready to run.
p9180
aVBut Buddh gazed straight ahead, unmoved, and the monkey, bold at\u000alast, gave the orange a most tremendous little shove.
p9181
aVIt tottered,\u000aand bumped down to the floor, and went rolling under the bed, and the\u000amonkey followed it with shrill little cries of triumph.
p9182
aVThe noise startled Okimi and she raised her head.
p9183
aVThen she went\u000ablindly over to Buddh, ugly, wrinkled, good little Buddh, who sat\u000across-legged and protected her.
p9184
aVShe patted the ridiculous little\u000adough-cakes with lingering, caressing hands, and stirred the spray of\u000aflowers so that they gave out their sweetest odor.
p9185
aVShe bent very low\u000abefore the god.
p9186
aV"Mighty Buddh," she pleaded, "he is my sooeetart.
p9187
aVI am just a little\u000agirl, and I love him.
p9188
aVPlease give him back to me, dear Buddh."
p9189
aVShe looked up at him timidly, seeking assurance, but he did not smile\u000aback at her.
p9190
aVShe was going to say more, trying to make Buddh\u000aunderstand how extremely important it was, but just then Mama San\u000aknocked at the door and told her she must come down-stairs.
p9191
aVSo Okimi dabbed on the rouge, and smoothed out her gay silken kimono,\u000aand took her samisen, and hurried down as fast as she could with her\u000afunny little toed-in steps.
p9192
aVCHAPTER VIII\u000a\u000aWHERE THERE IS NO TURNING\u000a\u000aAgain the swaying lamps burned dim above us, and the priestess of\u000aLal, all trembling, looked up at me with terror-haunted eyes.
p9193
aV"Poor little child," she whispered.
p9194
aV"Poor little life-mocked child!
p9195
aVThat is the bitter fate which women fear, to be sucked dry of their\u000afresh sweetness, of their life, and then be tossed aside.
p9196
aVOh, I have\u000aseen it many times.
p9197
aVWe give our all, and it is wasted because men--"\u000a\u000a"Not all men," I said.
p9198
aV"Not all men are like Okimi's warrior\u000asweetheart."
p9199
aV"They are all alike," cried the priestess of Lal vehemently.
p9200
aV"In\u000atheir hearts they are all alike, lighter than air, unstabler than\u000awater, more fickle than nectar-seeking butterflies.
p9201
aVThey love our\u000abeauty, and when that is gone--  Look you," she cried.
p9202
aV"This is the\u000atragedy of a woman, to be beautiful, to be loved, and to grow old.
p9203
aVLook," she said.
p9204
aV"I will show you."
p9205
aVOnce again the light of the silver lamps was quenched, and silent,\u000aside by side, the priestess of Lal and I looked far down the weary\u000apath which Eastern women travel not knowing where an end shall be.
p9206
aVIn all the ride from Segovia along the beach, Hazlitt met only three\u000aliving things, three women staring at him out of the folds of dingy\u000acalico which shielded their faces from the glare of sun and sea.
p9207
aVOne\u000awas young and very graceful; another was not so young, a comely,\u000aox-like thing, laden with comfortable fat.
p9208
aVThe third was old and\u000abent, with a hideously wrinkled, hopeless face, the mask of that\u000aimpatient death which shrivels away the women of the hot Eastern\u000aworld, outside and in.
p9209
aVFor a moment they startled him.
p9210
aVThey were\u000alike phantoms risen to confront him on the lifeless beach, for the\u000ayoungest was but a memory of what the eldest had been a little time\u000abefore, and the eldest only a prophecy of what the youngest soon\u000awould be.
p9211
aVAs they stood and watched him passing by, shifting their\u000aworn feet uneasily on the blistering sand, Hazlitt felt a mild\u000astirring of pity at the familiar sight.
p9212
aV"Hoy, friends," he hailed them.
p9213
aV"Can one of you tell me the way to\u000athe plantation of Don Raymundo?"
p9214
aVThe girl looked at him shyly under lowered lids; the grandmother,\u000asquatting on her haunches, puffed at a ragged fragment of cigar she\u000acarried and gazed out to sea; but the mother clutched volubly at the\u000aopportunity of speech.
p9215
aV"Go on till you come to the mango which blew down in the typhoon of\u000aten years ago," she said, "and the road is there.
p9216
aVIt is called the\u000a'Trail that has no Turning.'
p9217
aVDon Raymundo is a Castilian of the\u000anoblest, and he is the richest _haciendero_ in the world.
p9218
aVEach year\u000ahe loads a hundred ships with sugar.
p9219
aVThe plantation is called the\u000a'Hacienda without a Name.'
p9220
aVDon Raymundo has a daughter whose name is\u000aSeorita Dolores.
p9221
aVShe is the most beautiful woman in the world.
p9222
aVHis\u000awife is Doa Ceferina."
p9223
aVFor a moment a look of dislike crossed the\u000abroad, good-natured face.
p9224
aV"They call her Doa, and she is very\u000aproud, but after all she is just a mestizo, almost a Filipina like\u000aus.
p9225
aVShe--"\u000a\u000aHazlitt broke into her chatter with his thanks, flipped a coin in the\u000aair, and jogged on till he had left them far behind, three moving\u000adots on the waste, plodding the way of Malay womenfolk.
p9226
aVHidden in the green-shrouded wilderness of the lower hills, the\u000aHacienda without a Name lay under the sunset enchanting as a lost\u000afragment of some old world, where labor next the soil was the\u000ahappiest thing in life.
p9227
aVAnd up in the _sala_ of the great house on\u000athe hill, the mistress of the _hacienda_ stared at Hazlitt over her\u000acup.
p9228
aVShe was a beautiful woman, but under the Caucasian mold of her\u000afeatures another face was beginning to show dimly, the face of a race\u000awhose very heat and strength of life fuses all lines down to mere\u000ashapelessness of flesh.
p9229
aVA part of Doa Ceferina had been overtaken\u000aby the unrelenting advance of middle age.
p9230
aV"You say my husband is a prince, Seor?"
p9231
aVDoa Ceferina echoed\u000adoubtfully over her cup, and her soft forehead wrinkled in\u000abewilderment.
p9232
aVThis strange young visitor had puzzling notions of\u000awhat constitutes conversation, a diversion of which Doa Ceferina was\u000aextremely fond.
p9233
aV"Without doubt," she said, "I think that is a\u000amistake."
p9234
aVHazlitt looked at her in mingled amusement and vexation.
p9235
aVIn all his\u000awonderful day of discovery, this talkative, commonplace woman had\u000abeen the sole jarring note.
p9236
aVBut Doa Ceferina, oblivious to his\u000aemotions, sat in the cool twilight of the big room and poised her\u000acup, like some hybrid goddess of justice about to render a decision.
p9237
aV"Beyond doubt, it is a mistake," said Doa Ceferina.
p9238
aV"Don Raymundo's\u000afamily is one of the oldest in Spain, but it has never married with\u000aroyalty.
p9239
aVThere are few princes in Spain not of the royal blood; it\u000ais not like Russia."
p9240
aVThe word gave her a clue to a topic of real\u000ainterest, and she brightened.
p9241
aV"When I was a girl, back at school, I\u000amet a Russian prince, one summer at Biarritz--"\u000a\u000aOver _his_ cup, Don Raymundo's tiny Mephistophelian moustache lifted\u000aslightly in the mocking smile which was his extremest expression of\u000aemotion, and Hazlitt rushed to the righting of his false lead.
p9242
aV"Of course I did not mean that Don Raymundo was a prince in name," he\u000aexplained, "but in fact, you know."
p9243
aVDoa Ceferina raised her cup and sipped her chocolate resignedly, but\u000aHazlitt did not heed her.
p9244
aV"The startling, the wonderful thing to an American like me is that he\u000ais not only a prince in power, but a prince of another age.
p9245
aVThe\u000apeople here on the plantation are his, belong to him personally.
p9246
aVTake that thing we saw just now, for example, all those hundreds of\u000apeople coming in to the plantation kitchen for their suppers--"\u000a\u000aDoa Ceferina rose to her opportunity.
p9247
aV"If you only knew," she said,\u000a"how much rice it takes to feed five thousand people--"\u000a\u000aHazlitt, brimming with the enthusiasm the day had brought him, swept\u000aon.
p9248
aV"Think of having a jail of your own, and putting people in it\u000awhen you like, being their law!
p9249
aVWhy, I dare say they'd follow him to\u000awar if he told them to, and--and sack the next plantation.
p9250
aVIt's--it's positively feudal, you know.
p9251
aVThat's the only word; all\u000athis doesn't belong to our day at all.
p9252
aVAnd yet they say there's no\u000aromance left in trade!"
p9253
aVHe stopped abruptly, for Doa Ceferina was gazing at him with round\u000aeyes.
p9254
aVIf one could picture the eyes of a ruminative cow, watching\u000awith mild curiosity a serpent which sought to charm her, one would\u000ahave seen the eyes of Doa Ceferina just then.
p9255
aVDon Raymundo smiled\u000ainscrutably, and the pause grew awkward.
p9256
aVSuddenly a soft voice came to Hazlitt's relief.
p9257
aV"You remember\u000a'feudal,' mama," it said reassuringly.
p9258
aV"Ever so long ago, when they\u000ahad knights and squires and--and _gens-d'armes_, and people lived in\u000acastles, and they had the Inquisition in Spain, and the friars,\u000aand--and everything.
p9259
aVThat was 'feudal.'"
p9260
aVDoa Ceferina sighed with relief and sipped: "Dolores has just come\u000aback from school, so she remembers all those things," she explained\u000ato Hazlitt.
p9261
aV"I learned them once, of course, but one forgets, out\u000ahere.
p9262
aVAnd so you think we're feudal?
p9263
aVI don't know, I'm sure.
p9264
aVOf\u000acourse there aren't any knights any more, or castles, but we _do_\u000ahave the friars.
p9265
aVListen, seor," and she set her cup on a little\u000atable, to give freedom to her hands, and plunged into the story of\u000athe latest exaction by the local representative of the hierarchy of\u000athe Philippines.
p9266
aVNo one minded her much.
p9267
aVHer husband sat with half-closed eyes and\u000apuffed at his cigarette, Dolores turned to her window and gazed down\u000aon her little world as it went to sleep, and Hazlitt's eyes persisted\u000ain wandering to the girlish figure, glowing in a belated, ruddy shaft\u000aof light.
p9268
aVDecidedly, the talkative woman on the beach had shown some\u000adiscrimination in placing Seorita Dolores on the pinnacle of beauty.
p9269
aVSuddenly Hazlitt became aware that Doa Ceferina's tale was told, and\u000athat her talk had taken a more personal turn.
p9270
aV[Illustration: "_Dolores gazed down on her little world as it went to\u000asleep._"]\u000a\u000a"It's so good to have one from our own world to talk to again," she\u000asaid enthusiastically.
p9271
aV"One gets lonely here, with only natives for\u000aneighbors.
p9272
aVI tremble to think what my existence would have been,\u000aafter I came back from school, if Don Raymundo had not been here to\u000arescue me."
p9273
aVShe smiled radiantly at her black and white spouse, as\u000aif to include him in the conversation, but he only drew long on his\u000acigarette and puffed the smoke very deliberately toward the ceiling.
p9274
aVHazlitt's eyes wandered to the window again, and Doa Ceferina's\u000afollowed them.
p9275
aV"Isn't she beautiful?"
p9276
aVshe whispered.
p9277
aV"Yes," said Hazlitt, half to himself.
p9278
aV"She's like a Madonna, a\u000aMadonna whom some great man dreamed of painting and gave up in\u000adespair."
p9279
aV"Exactly," Doa Ceferina agreed hastily.
p9280
aV"That's just it.
p9281
aVShe's\u000abeautiful as the Virgin herself, and good!
p9282
aVPoor child, after three\u000ayears of Paris and Madrid, to come back to this!"
p9283
aVShe swept an\u000aover-jeweled hand at the great, simple, dignified room.
p9284
aV"No wonder\u000ashe's lonely, poor little dear.
p9285
aVGo and talk to her, Seor Hasleet."
p9286
aVHazlitt accepted his permission with alacrity.
p9287
aVAs he approached,\u000aDoa Dolores glanced timidly at him across the gulf of sex, which\u000atradition and training had fixed between her and all male things not\u000aof her blood, and retreated into herself.
p9288
aVHer shyness was part of\u000aher attraction, Hazlitt thought, and did not find the silence awkward\u000aas he stood beside her and looked down with her on the _hacienda_.
p9289
aVIn the shaggy village clustered about the squat stone chimney of the\u000amill, groups of girls and young men were laughing and splashing about\u000athe wells; from the little groves which embowered the houses, the\u000aevening fires glowed red; the light breeze carried, even to that\u000adistance, a hint of the pungent wood-smoke.
p9290
aVAs Hazlitt watched the\u000apeaceful scene, all the love of the open which had led him wandering\u000athrough life rolled over him in a wave.
p9291
aV"Jove, it's a good old world, after all," he said.
p9292
aVThe girl glanced up at him quickly.
p9293
aV"After all?"
p9294
aVshe echoed\u000aplaintively.
p9295
aV"Tell me, seor.
p9296
aVThe Sisters always said that the\u000aworld was bad, and we must be afraid of it.
p9297
aVWhen you speak so,\u000a_saying_ that it is good, I wonder if you also do not think it is\u000abad.
p9298
aVWhy isn't it good, if we are happy in it?"
p9299
aVHazlitt smiled down into her puzzled eyes.
p9300
aVDecidedly they were\u000amatter-of-fact, these women of the _hacienda_.
p9301
aV"It is good," he\u000aassured her, with the calm philosophy of his thirty years behind him.
p9302
aV"Of course it's good."
p9303
aVStill she looked up at him, forgetting her\u000ashyness, and a gust of protectiveness and elder-brotherly affection\u000afor this tender, budding woman-thing took hold of him.
p9304
aV"It's good,"\u000ahe urged, "and you will always be happy in it."
p9305
aVBack in the dimness Doa Ceferina was sipping her third cup of\u000achocolate, while Raymundo smoked with half shut eyes and smiled\u000ainscrutably.
p9306
aVLike Dorcas or Abigail or whoever she was of old, Doa Ceferina sat\u000aamong her maidens.
p9307
aVThere were half a dozen of them on the floor,\u000asewing and spinning and chattering in subdued voices, while the\u000amistress of the _hacienda_ sat enthroned in the midst of them.
p9308
aVBut\u000aunlike whoever she was of old, Doa Ceferina had a card-table before\u000aher, and on the other side of the table Hazlitt sat, and the two\u000asmiled companionably across at each other as they sorted fat bundles\u000aof cards.
p9309
aVThey were playing _panguingui_.
p9310
aVOne plays _panguingui_ with six\u000apacks of cards and much patience.
p9311
aVDoa Ceferina and Hazlitt had\u000aplayed a good deal of it since they first met, six months before, and\u000aHazlitt's patience had never wearied.
p9312
aVNeither had the patience of\u000aSeorita Dolores, which is more to the point, for she had to stand\u000abehind Hazlitt's chair and help him with the unfamiliar cards.
p9313
aVShe\u000awas standing there now.
p9314
aV"Hazleet, it is your lead," said Doa Ceferina, gathering up her\u000ahand.
p9315
aVIt was a sign of the fellowship established between them that\u000ashe called him Hazlitt in the good, round, Spanish way, without any\u000afuss over titles.
p9316
aVIt was a stronger sign that she sat with her feet\u000atucked up in her chair, native-fashion.
p9317
aV"One gets used to it," she\u000ahad explained, the first time she ventured it in his presence, "and\u000ait's much more comfortable."
p9318
aV"Hazleet, I shall beat you again," said Doa Ceferina.
p9319
aV"Lead!"
p9320
aVHazlitt laid his finger inquiringly on a card, and looked back over\u000ahis shoulder, where a pair of interested eyes signalled approval.
p9321
aVSuddenly he spied a forgotten card down in the corner of his fistful.
p9322
aVSeorita Dolores gave a small wail of dismay as he played it, and\u000aDoa Ceferina smiled in pleasant derision.
p9323
aV"I mistook it for a King," said Hazlitt in apology.
p9324
aV"It is a mistake," said the remorseless Doa Ceferina, "which costs\u000ayou a _media peseta_.
p9325
aVNow play again."
p9326
aVHazlitt played again and again, and lost each time, and enjoyed Doa\u000aCeferina's little triumph almost as much as she did.
p9327
aVShe wasn't half\u000abad, if she was not exciting, this plump good-natured Doa Ceferina,\u000awith her eternal cigarette and her cards or novel or conversation.
p9328
aVHazlitt smiled whimsically at that last thought.
p9329
aV"What are you\u000alaughing at, Hazleet?"
p9330
aVhis opponent demanded.
p9331
aVHe had been thinking of the Frenchwoman who was famed for having such\u000aa marvellous gift for conversation, and none at all for dialogue, but\u000ahe couldn't very well tell Doa Ceferina that.
p9332
aV"At the way I'm\u000aplaying," he replied.
p9333
aV"You couldn't well play worse," said Doa Ceferina good-humoredly,\u000ataking toll of her bit of silver.
p9334
aV"Lead again."
p9335
aVHazlitt _could_ play worse, and promptly did it.
p9336
aVThere are infinite\u000apossibilities of badness, even in _panguingui_.
p9337
aVNot at all a bad\u000aperson to share a secret with, this simple, matter-of-fact Doa\u000aCeferina.
p9338
aVAnd he believed they were sharing one.
p9339
aVIn Doa Ceferina's\u000aplacidly romantic bosom, he guessed, had grown a vision of a young\u000aprince come out of the West to rescue her imprisoned princess from\u000athis tropical Castle of Indolence.
p9340
aVA vision had come to him, too, a\u000avision which made him lean back and forget his cards.
p9341
aVSix months ago\u000aa beach-comber, gilded and respectable, of course, but still a\u000abeach-comber, an adventurer, without a country; and now, perhaps, a\u000aman whom many a petty prince might envy.
p9342
aVFancy ruling undisputed\u000awith Seorita Dolores over the quiet domain of the "Hacienda without\u000aa Name!"
p9343
aVJove, what a queen she'd make.
p9344
aVA hand stole down over his and pityingly pointed out the proper card,\u000aand Hazlitt sternly repressed an impulse to fling away the cards and\u000atake the hand, and keep it.
p9345
aVThe time was drawing near when he must\u000aput his fortune to the test.
p9346
aVThe cards ran out, and Doa Ceferina glowed triumphant.
p9347
aV"Another\u000agame, Hazleet?"
p9348
aVshe asked.
p9349
aVHazlitt laughingly turned his pocket out to show that the modest sum\u000aallotted for the stakes of the day was exhausted, and Doa Ceferina\u000aswept up her little heap of silver.
p9350
aV"You play worse than ever, I\u000athink," she said frankly.
p9351
aV"Still, I may learn _panguingui_ before I die," said Hazlitt.
p9352
aVA\u000asudden impulse seized him.
p9353
aVHe leaned forward and fixed the mistress\u000aof the _hacienda_ with his eye.
p9354
aV"I rather think, Doa Ceferina," he\u000asaid, with slow emphasis, "that I shall have to stay out here till I\u000adie.
p9355
aVThere seems to be no escape.
p9356
aVI shall have to stay and--learn\u000ato play _panguingui_.
p9357
aVWhat do you think?"
p9358
aVIn the heavy eyes of Doa Ceferina a small glow kindled, as of the\u000asurviving remnants of a very tiny fire.
p9359
aVHazlitt had seen them light\u000athat way before, when Doa Ceferina reached the climax of a novel.
p9360
aVThe glow deepened, and she looked at his understandingly.
p9361
aVHer hand\u000atrembled a little on the table.
p9362
aV"Why not, Hazleet?"
p9363
aVshe said.
p9364
aV"It--it would be very pleasant for all of us.
p9365
aVI--"  She rose\u000ahastily.
p9366
aV"I shall have to leave you for a minute.
p9367
aVI hope you and\u000aDolores can amuse yourselves till luncheon," she said with elaborate\u000ainnocence, and went away.
p9368
aVHazlitt followed poor unsuspecting Dolores, thus left as a ewe lamb\u000ato the wolf, over to the window, and stood looking down with her,\u000awhile the half-dozen maidens let needle and spindle fall, and\u000aexchanged knowing glances.
p9369
aVThe rains had come and gone, and the tropical world was thrilling\u000awith the swift rush of its springtime.
p9370
aVThe black fields were mistily\u000agreen with the new-set spikes of cane, the sky was fleecy with white\u000abanks of cloud, the very air was sweet and full of life.
p9371
aVHazlitt\u000adrew a deep breath of it.
p9372
aV"God!"
p9373
aVhe said, "what a good old place\u000athis old world is to live in."
p9374
aVDolores glanced up at him.
p9375
aVNo one would have called her a Madonna\u000anow.
p9376
aVThe spring-tide had entered into her, and she was vibrant with\u000aa thrill of living of which no monkish painter ever dreamed.
p9377
aV"Why do\u000ayou talk like that?"
p9378
aVshe demanded.
p9379
aV"Of course it's a good world."
p9380
aVHazlitt gazed down into the upturned eyes.
p9381
aV"And you are happy in it,\u000aDolores?"
p9382
aVhe asked.
p9383
aVAt his tone Dolores flushed rosy and turned away, and her hand\u000agripped the edge of the broad sill with little, helpless, useless\u000afingers.
p9384
aVHazlitt laid his hand over it protectingly, and it did not\u000adraw away.
p9385
aV"You are happy, Dolores?"
p9386
aVhe repeated.
p9387
aV"Of course," said Dolores faintly.
p9388
aV"Why shouldn't I be, when\u000aeverything is--so beautiful and--and good?"
p9389
aV"Happy Dolores," said Hazlitt.
p9390
aVAnd then Don Raymundo rode round the\u000aturn in the shrubbery below and swung from the saddle.
p9391
aVDolores\u000ashrank back, but Don Raymundo only smiled up inscrutably.
p9392
aVIf he had\u000aseen the little comedy, he gave no sign.
p9393
aV"I'll join you in a\u000aminute," he called to them.
p9394
aVA flash of anger swept over Hazlitt at this man whose mere approach\u000atook all the witchery from life.
p9395
aVHe pressed Dolores' hand before he\u000areleased it.
p9396
aV"She shall be happy," he muttered defiantly, to Don\u000aRaymundo and the world.
p9397
aV"She shall be happy always."
p9398
aV"There seems to be a great deal of unnecessary time in the world,"\u000aDon Raymundo observed with his perverse triviality.
p9399
aVHe and Hazlitt\u000ahad run across each other in the _sala_ after their siesta, and now\u000athey were sitting with their long chairs drawn up before a window,\u000awaiting for the end of the day.
p9400
aV"Perhaps there is," Hazlitt agreed, slowly gathering resolution for\u000ahis plunge.
p9401
aV"And yet, with agreeable companionship, and perhaps a\u000awife--Don Raymundo, we Americans are blunt.
p9402
aVI want to marry Doa\u000aDolores."
p9403
aVDon Raymundo smoked placidly for a moment.
p9404
aV"I have been expecting\u000athis," he said at last.
p9405
aV"I have--shall _I_ be blunt?--been fearing\u000athis."
p9406
aVHazlitt flushed.
p9407
aV"I know it seems presumptuous," he said.
p9408
aV"People\u000awill call me a climber.
p9409
aVAnd yet--  We have no aristocracy in my\u000acountry, no recognized aristocracy, as perhaps you know.
p9410
aVBut of such\u000afamilies as we have, mine is not the worst.
p9411
aVFor five generations--"\u000a\u000a"I care little about families," said Don Raymundo coolly.
p9412
aVThe tone was courteous, but the words stung Hazlitt.
p9413
aV"I am not a\u000arich man," he said, "but I have enough.
p9414
aVI was afraid at first that\u000ait was the _hacienda_ I cared for, not the wealth of it, but the\u000apower and romance of the life here.
p9415
aVThat was what took me at first,\u000abut now it's Doa Dolores herself.
p9416
aVI know it.
p9417
aVI had hoped--" he\u000ahesitated.
p9418
aVAfter six months of almost daily intercourse it was as\u000aimpossible to break through Don Raymundo's smiling reserve as it had\u000abeen at first.
p9419
aV"I had hoped that you might find the company of\u000aanother white man not disagreeable, that we might perhaps even become\u000afriends, but--all that doesn't matter, but simply this: it isn't the\u000a_hacienda_ I want."
p9420
aVDon Raymundo spread out his hands with a gesture of utter weariness.
p9421
aV"I care so little for the _hacienda_ and who has it and what becomes\u000aof it," he said, "that if the burden of it could be lifted from me I\u000ashould be almost happy, I think."
p9422
aVAnd while scorn for the eternal\u000aposing of the man was setting Hazlitt's lips, he went on: "My friend,\u000aand I call you friend because I feel a friendliness for you, I am\u000agoing to tell you a story I never thought to tell to any one."
p9423
aVDon\u000aRaymundo's momentary energy dropped from him.
p9424
aV"If you care to\u000alisten," he amended, in his most uninterested manner.
p9425
aV"Go on, please," said Hazlitt impatiently.
p9426
aV"It is a story of a young man in Spain," said Don Raymundo, "a boy\u000awho had a mama and a sister and a name, all of them associated with a\u000arambling stone house that perched on a sunburnt hill.
p9427
aVHe also had a\u000asomewhat lively and energetic brain, and a very moderate education.
p9428
aVAll he lacked was an income.
p9429
aVI hope I do not bore you more than\u000ausual?"
p9430
aVHazlitt moved restlessly, and Don Raymundo continued: "Observe the\u000asequence.
p9431
aVThe wealth of dreams is traditionally Oriental, and the\u000aPhilippines lie in the Orient.
p9432
aVSo the boy, lying there beneath the\u000abroken roof of the gaunt stone house, and being sadly in need of an\u000aincome, dreams of a journey over sunny seas to a region where\u000aSpaniards dwell in palaces and gain untold gold, living like little\u000agods together on broad acres where cane rustles and coffee-blossoms\u000agleam and the hemp sends up its never-dying stalk.
p9433
aVDemonio!"
p9434
aVsaid\u000aDon Raymundo, with a mocking lightness bitter as it well could be, "I\u000aseem to be falling into the mood of that boy who dreamed."
p9435
aVDon Raymundo's silence seemed expectant, somehow, and Hazlitt asked:\u000a"He came?"
p9436
aV"He came," said Don Raymundo, "and he awoke.
p9437
aVThey say that he found\u000athe rustling cane and the gleaming blossoms a bit monotonous, even\u000awhile they turned to gold beneath his touch.
p9438
aVHis environment, I take\u000ait, must have been rather like--"  He motioned toward the window and\u000athe world that lay outside it, the fields stretching away in the\u000aburning light to the dim edge of the forest, the endless sweep of the\u000ajungle, the distant glow of the sleeping sea, all the untamable world\u000athat pressed around the "Hacienda without a Name."
p9439
aV"Like this," Hazlitt assented reluctantly.
p9440
aV"Like this," Don Raymundo agreed.
p9441
aV"People say he said at last that\u000aproper companionship, and perhaps a wife--_Dis mio_, I grow stupid.
p9442
aVHis nearest neighbor, who was half a native, was--blessed, I believe\u000athe proper word is--blessed with a daughter.
p9443
aVA most charming young\u000awoman in those days, they tell me, very gay, very gentle, very\u000aaffectionate, most accomplished; she had spent many years on the\u000aContinent, I believe.
p9444
aVIn short, she was an unusually beautiful and\u000aattractive young person, very like--"\u000a\u000a"Like--" Hazlitt began unwillingly, and stopped.
p9445
aV"Like Dolores," Don Raymundo assented for him.
p9446
aV"And this interesting\u000ayoung woman naturally felt ill at ease among her homestaying\u000ahalf-countrymen, and naturally had much in common--but all that is\u000aeasily understood.
p9447
aVThey were married.
p9448
aVAnd that," Don Raymundo said\u000awith languid brutality, "seems to have been the ending of the young\u000aman's second dream.
p9449
aVSince then he has lived with open eyes."
p9450
aVHazlitt felt a twinge of shame come over him at listening.
p9451
aVAfter\u000aall, the law which establishes a neutral strip of silence between men\u000ais based on something deeper than mere convention.
p9452
aV"Don't you think," Hazlitt asked at last--he had to say\u000asomething--"that this young man took himself too seriously, too\u000atragically?
p9453
aVIf he had given more to life, had gone about among\u000apeople--"\u000a\u000a"I understand," Don Raymundo interrupted him, "that he declined to go\u000aout among his countrymen, where his wife was received only as a favor\u000ato himself and his name.
p9454
aVHe was a somewhat Quixotic young man, you\u000asee.
p9455
aVAnd his Filipino friends, though worthy people doubtless, were\u000asomewhat unattractive and dull to both the young man and his wife.
p9456
aVSo in the end he was restricted to the joys of home.
p9457
aVAnd his wife\u000agrew old more rapidly than he.
p9458
aVThere seemed to be something in her\u000ablood that made her grow old quickly."
p9459
aVFor a moment Hazlitt felt a gleam of pity for the lonely man beside\u000ahim.
p9460
aVThen his back stiffened.
p9461
aV"I do not think," said Hazlitt, and for his life could not keep the\u000avibration of scorn from his voice, "that I love Doa Dolores merely\u000abecause she is young and beautiful.
p9462
aVWhat I want is to make _her_\u000ahappy.
p9463
aVWe can grow old together."
p9464
aVDon Raymundo smiled, and for once his smile was patient instead of\u000amocking.
p9465
aV"You are like that young man of mine now," he said gently.
p9466
aV"You remind me very much of him.
p9467
aVWhen you are older, you will judge\u000aless harshly.
p9468
aVAnd aren't you overlooking something?
p9469
aVIs it my\u000ahappiness that counts, or yours, or even Dolores', though it's hard\u000athat she should suffer for the mistake her father made."
p9470
aVHe drew\u000ahimself up in his chair and looked at Hazlitt with a new light in his\u000aeyes.
p9471
aV"Have you any right to marry her?"
p9472
aVhe asked almost sternly.
p9473
aV"What of\u000ayour children?
p9474
aVAnd their children?
p9475
aVA hundred years from now, will\u000athey be--_white_?
p9476
aVOr must they go on forever belonging nowhere,\u000adespised by half the brothers of their blood, and themselves\u000adespising the other half?
p9477
aVWhere will it end?"
p9478
aVEnlightenment burst on Hazlitt in a flash.
p9479
aVThis was no lover's\u000aobstacle, to be surmounted by theatric leaps and bounds.
p9480
aVHe had come\u000aface to face with one of the truths of life, Nature's unescapable law\u000aof blood.
p9481
aVHe saw them coming, the slow generations, men of no race\u000aand country.
p9482
aV"My God!"
p9483
aVhe said, and gripped the arms of his chair\u000atill the cane splintered.
p9484
aVA door opened at the other end of the big room.
p9485
aV"Our companions are\u000acoming," said Don Raymundo quietly, and rose with punctilious\u000acourtesy.
p9486
aVAfter the greetings Doa Ceferina went directly to the gleaming tray\u000awhich bore the chocolate and biscuits which buoy one from the dead\u000alanguor of the siesta to the full tide of evening life.
p9487
aVHazlitt sank\u000aback in his chair again.
p9488
aVSuddenly a soft voice asked over his\u000ashoulder: "You haven't forgotten to save this day week for our\u000a_baile_, have you?
p9489
aVYou must come, you know, because then," Dolores\u000ahesitated at her boldness but rattled on, "because then I sha'n't\u000ahave to dance so often with these stupid native boys."
p9490
aVHazlitt gripped the arms of his chair again.
p9491
aVThe moment for decision\u000ahad come.
p9492
aVAll those unborn generations were waiting for his answer.
p9493
aVDolores was waiting too, poor, helpless, innocent Dolores.
p9494
aVHe looked\u000ato Don Raymundo for relief, but Don Raymundo, at a window, had turned\u000ahis back and was puffing at his eternal cigarette.
p9495
aVThe pause grew\u000along.
p9496
aVThen slowly Hazlitt straightened in his chair, and as he\u000alooked up at the wondering face behind him, the law and the prophets\u000awere swept away in a gush of pitying affection.
p9497
aVPitying, and then?
p9498
aVShe seemed so rarely, wonderfully beautiful to him, rare and precious\u000aas some golden flower from supernal gardens.
p9499
aVHe could not let her\u000ago, could not give up her surpassing loveliness.
p9500
aV"Yes," he said very\u000afirmly, "yes, I will come."
p9501
aV"_Lalal!_" Doa Ceferina laughed from her place behind the cups.
p9502
aV"He speaks as seriously as if he made a vow to Our Lady.
p9503
aVIt's only a\u000aball, you know, Hazleet.
p9504
aVGive the men their chocolate, Dolorcita."
p9505
aVShe raised her cup and sipped happily.
p9506
aV"After all," she said, in a\u000atone of deep content, "there are few things in life more delightful\u000athan one's chocolate and cigarette."
p9507
aVDon Raymundo was gazing from his window off into the distance, where\u000athe gathering shadows were blending forest and cane-field.
p9508
aV"Chocolate is very good," he said thoughtfully.
p9509
aVThree women tramped in the glare of endless Segovia beach.
p9510
aVOne was\u000ayoung and graceful; another was a comely, ox-like thing of middle\u000aage; the third was at the end of life.
p9511
aVThey halted for a moment to\u000arest, and the grandmother squatted on her haunches and gazed,\u000aunseeing, out over the water.
p9512
aV"There will be a wedding at the _hacienda_ next month," said the girl.
p9513
aV"Yes," said her mother, "the young American will marry Seorita\u000aDolores.
p9514
aVThey say he is very rich, richer than Don Raymundo."
p9515
aV"He is very big and handsome," said the girl wistfully.
p9516
aV"And Doa\u000aDolores--she is very beautiful and kind."
p9517
aVA flash of jealousy crossed the mother's broad, good-natured face.
p9518
aV"Yes," she said, "she is beautiful.
p9519
aVBut after all she is only a\u000a_mestiza_, almost a Filipina like the rest of us.
p9520
aVAnd she will grow\u000aold."
p9521
aVThen, having halted a moment, they tramped on along their path like\u000aphantoms risen on the lifeless beach, for the youngest was but a\u000amemory of what the eldest had been a little time before, and the\u000aeldest was only a prophecy of what the youngest soon would be.
p9522
aVCHAPTER IX\u000a\u000aAN OPTIMIST\u000a\u000aI cannot hope to describe to you my dismay at finding myself back in\u000athat ancient temple of Tzin Piau, nor the dislike with which I\u000alooked into the eyes of that old heathen priest, those slant eyes\u000awhere cynical amusement, like a little, undying flame, danced and\u000aflickered.
p9523
aV"And so," said the bland old gentleman, raising himself languidly on\u000ahis hollowed slab of stone, "and so you find the company of the\u000aladies more agreeable than mine?
p9524
aVI do not wonder.
p9525
aVHow did you leave\u000athem all in the temple of Lal?"
p9526
aVIt would be impossible to indicate\u000athe sly mockery which rustled in his tone.
p9527
aV"So that was your doing, too?"
p9528
aVI asked.
p9529
aVHe moved a deprecatory hand, smiling blandly through me into space.
p9530
aV"I may have been used as an unworthy instrument," he murmured, "but\u000afor most of your experience, I fancy, you're indebted to the Little\u000aGods themselves.
p9531
aVDid you find amusement, or instruction, was\u000ait?--forgive me, I forget--in the Games they showed you?"
p9532
aV"I'm very tired of your Little Gods, if they exist," I said bluntly,\u000afor he made me angry.
p9533
aV"As I told you once, and as I would tell them\u000ato their faces, I think them cowards.
p9534
aVI ask you again, do they never\u000agive their victims a fair chance?
p9535
aVIs there never a single plaything\u000aof theirs which, fighting bravely and in good faith, is permitted to\u000awin?
p9536
aVAre the dice always cogged?"
p9537
aV"You like to see them win?"
p9538
aVmy old heathen priest asked in bland\u000asurprise.
p9539
aV"What a very commonplace taste; for people are always\u000awinning what they strive for, thousands of them every day.
p9540
aVIt's only\u000athe exceptions, the surprises, which are interesting.
p9541
aVI thought you\u000aasked to see Life through my eyes.
p9542
aVBut since your taste runs that\u000away--" he yawned ever so slightly behind his hand--"You'll excuse me,\u000awon't you?"
p9543
aVhe apologized, "but this is an hour which I invariably\u000adevote to a nap."
p9544
aVHe made a little careless, dismissing gesture.
p9545
aV"Wander where you choose," said he, "and watch men fight, since\u000athat's your taste, and win--what they may win."
p9546
aVIt was my dismissal, and there I saw him last, as I had seen him\u000afirst, lying motionless on his hollowed slab, smiling blandly,\u000acynically, into Emptiness, with light yet bitter mockery in his smile.
p9547
aVThen, or so it seemed to me, I wandered far and long, and saw many\u000amen striving mightily for many things, and most of them were winners,\u000aand most of them, winning, found themselves no nearer their hearts'\u000adesires.
p9548
aVBut among them I marked three, and have remembered them,\u000awhose striving seemed to me not wholly without interest.
p9549
aVThe first\u000aof them was a very common-seeming man indeed, and the only thing\u000aabout him which made him worthy of remark was, that he was an\u000aoptimist.
p9550
aVSamar is a sorry strip of island which rises in gray-green,\u000acommonplace, and yet sinister ugliness from a green and treacherous\u000asea.
p9551
aVIts coasts are a desolation of over-thrifty vegetation.
p9552
aVIts\u000ainterior, so far as it has been explored, is a wilderness of forest\u000aand precipitous mountains.
p9553
aVAnd the people who inhabit it are worthy\u000aof the place, outcasts and refugees from other islands, outlawed men\u000afor whom no other spot of earth holds a future.
p9554
aVToward the end of 1901, soldiers and marines and sailors, the 41st\u000aInfantry, U.S.A., among them, were rushed to Samar to punish the\u000amurderers of Balangiga and cleanse the plague-spot of the Philippines\u000aof its spawn.
p9555
aVThe work proved to be difficult and slow.
p9556
aVThe blazing\u000asummer had darkened into such winter as the Eastern tropics know, a\u000aseason of lowering skies and deluges of rain, and dank cold and\u000aboisterous winds, and still the quarry flitted elusively from\u000astronghold to stronghold of the untracked mountains, emerging at rare\u000aintervals to strike with murderous suddenness at unexpected places\u000aand then disappear, as hard to bring to bay as any other beast of\u000aprey which makes cunning atone for its lack of strength and courage.
p9557
aVAt Sabey, a hopeless town half-way up the east coast of the island,\u000aCompany B of the 41st was stationed, as hard-fisted, hard-mouthed,\u000ahard-living, hard-fighting a set of terriers as ever was enlisted.
p9558
aVIts Captain, one Burrell, delighted in catching his pets wild and\u000ataming them to his peculiar taste.
p9559
aVB's ranks, for the most part,\u000awere filled by transfer from other organizations whose officers were\u000aglad to turn over their black sheep.
p9560
aVBurrell, by some method of his\u000aown, speedily made soldiers, his sort of soldiers, of them, and they\u000aswore by him.
p9561
aVIt was unusual for B to sit in garrison when the 41st was afield, for\u000athe company had a reputation consonant with its character, and was\u000awelcome at the front whenever there was action.
p9562
aVBut all that autumn\u000ait was held in quarters, while the rain drummed on the iron roof and\u000areports came in of little battles north and south and west.
p9563
aV"Ev'rybody had a man's size grouch on, fr'm th' Old Man down," they\u000areported afterward.
p9564
aV"Ev'rybody but just John Henry Sullivan, him we\u000acalled Peaceful Henry.
p9565
aVYou couldn't hammer a grouch onto Peaceful\u000awith an axe."
p9566
aVSullivan was the humorist of the company, a long, lank, freckled\u000afigure-of-fun who was tolerated, ordinarily, though unmercifully\u000amocked, for a certain likable simplicity of mind and a childish\u000afriendliness for everything.
p9567
aVBut that fall his antics palled on B.
p9568
aV"They was times when we'd a been glad to kill him," as they said, "if\u000ait hadn't been for havin' to look forrard to a long enlistment with\u000ahim down below."
p9569
aVBut at the very end of the year a hope of cornering the enemy\u000aappeared, and the spirits of B Company rose accordingly.
p9570
aVMidway of\u000aits length, Samar narrows till a scant thirty-five miles separates\u000athe long rollers of the Pacific shore from the quieter waters of the\u000aVisayan Sea.
p9571
aVSo, at least, the triangulation of the Coast Survey\u000abore witness, then.
p9572
aVUntil that winter there was no record of men who\u000ahad crossed the savage island.
p9573
aVBut a local tradition asserted that\u000aan old and long-abandoned trail led from Sabey on the east coast,\u000athat very Sabey where B was stationed, to Nalang on the west.
p9574
aVIf that ancient trail could be opened once more, Samar would be cut\u000ain two, the activity of the skulking outlaws would be impeded, and a\u000ascheme of effective reconcentration would be possible at last.
p9575
aVThe\u000amen of B Company felt that their old luck was with them when the duty\u000aof making the first reconnaissance of the old trail fell to them.
p9576
aVThey were ready to move at once, and soon after reveille, on the\u000amorning of December 25th, Captain Burrell, Lieutenant Roberts, and\u000atwenty men, all dressed in the blue and khaki of field service, and\u000abearing haversacks bulging with four days' rations, assembled on the\u000abeach at Sabey to make an attempt at crossing Samar.
p9577
aVIt was an inauspiciously gray and threatening morning.
p9578
aVBehind the\u000aexplorers, breakers crashed thunderously on the sand, and a roaring\u000anortheast monsoon whipped spume about in frothy sheets.
p9579
aVBefore them,\u000athe wilderness lay grim and forbidding, in the cold light.
p9580
aVBut they\u000aaccepted the rawness and the gloom with the indifference of long\u000aacquaintance.
p9581
aVFour marches straight westward, of ten miles each at\u000amost, child's play to men like them, should bring them to Nalang.
p9582
aVThere was no breath of adventure in the air.
p9583
aVYet of the party which faced the hills that morning, seven lie within\u000athe shadow still, and only one came out again unaided, seventeen days\u000alater, to report that somewhere behind him fourteen men of B,\u000aincluding the Old Man who made it B, lay starving and delirious with\u000afever.
p9584
aVOn the morning of the start, they had of course no premonition of all\u000athis.
p9585
aVBurrell and Roberts waved careless farewells to the one lady\u000aof Sabey, the post surgeon's young wife, the men grumbled aimlessly\u000aat the prospect of a wet march and a wet camp, and Sullivan, settling\u000ahis haversack strap more comfortably, grinned at the disappointed\u000aones in front of quarters who could not go.
p9586
aV"Reckon we'll locate\u000athat overland route for the Sumner this time, sure," he remarked,\u000awith a fatuous attempt at humor.
p9587
aV"Fall in," the Captain ordered, and the little column set its front\u000awestward and swung off along the drenched banks of Sabey River.
p9588
aVFour days later, as an early nightfall was closing down, eighteen of\u000athe party struggled to the summit of a half-wooded ridge in the\u000ainterior of the island, and the worn-out men straightened up with\u000amomentary eagerness to peer into the cloud-hung west.
p9589
aVOnly the\u000ablankness of further up-tumbled ridges and black waves of forest\u000aveiled in sheets of rain lay before them, and to north, south, and\u000aeast as well.
p9590
aVNowhere on the circle of the horizon was a leaden\u000agleam of the guiding sea.
p9591
aVThe men seemed dazed.
p9592
aVThey had made their four marches, of far more\u000athan ten miles each, it seemed, at such cost of strength and courage\u000aas no one who has not travelled in that land can comprehend.
p9593
aVThey\u000ahad made the last march on all but a remnant of their food, and the\u000abaffling trail they followed had led them nowhere.
p9594
aVAn hour before it\u000ahad vanished in a thicket.
p9595
aVSince then they had cut a trail with\u000atheir bayonets, pushing for this ridge in the hope that from its\u000asummit they might see the coast at last.
p9596
aVInstead, they found that\u000athey were lost in the Samar hills.
p9597
aVFaint from hunger and exertion,\u000achilled to the bone from tramping in clammy clothing and sleeping in\u000adrenched blankets, with shoes that burst from their swollen feet like\u000apulp and hung in shreds, already halting of speech and step with the\u000aburning weakness of fever, half a dozen of them, they stood there in\u000athe beating downpour, stunned, and daunted.
p9598
aVAll this had come to them in four days,--that was the paralyzing\u000afact.
p9599
aVIt appalled them that all their pride of strength should have\u000avanished in that little space, when other days were coming, how many\u000ano one knew, of uglier promise.
p9600
aVFoiled, while they still had food\u000aand strength, by the task they had set themselves, each day of\u000aincreased weakness and privation now would call them to increased\u000aexertion till the sea was reached--the sea which might, and might\u000anot, lie beyond the furthest of those mountains to the west, if it\u000awas west.
p9601
aVDumbly they stared at them, avoiding each other's eyes.
p9602
aVCaptain Burrell, still weakened by the wound he got in front of\u000aTientsin, was one of the hardest-hit of the fever-victims, and his\u000ateeth chattered when he talked, but he retained a humor dryer than\u000athe weather.
p9603
aV"I reckon we'll camp right here," he said.
p9604
aV"H'm.
p9605
aVWe\u000acan't quite fetch the coast to-night, and this ridge is well-drained,\u000aanyway.
p9606
aVH'm."
p9607
aVThe least weary of the men smiled forlornly in response to the spirit\u000athat lived in their Old Man, and Sullivan laughed outright.
p9608
aV"I've\u000abeen lookin' for a well-dreened place like this to start my\u000acactus-farm in, sir," he remarked.
p9609
aVAlready the formalities of rank\u000ahad vanished, and discipline meant obedience for the common good, not\u000aceremony.
p9610
aV"Might do it, by irrigating," said the Captain.
p9611
aV"H'm."
p9612
aVHe cast a\u000asharp glance at his one unapprehensive subordinate.
p9613
aV"The rest of you\u000acamp right here," he ordered.
p9614
aV"Sullivan and I are going back along\u000ato stir up those loafers who fell out."
p9615
aV"See here, sir," Lieutenant Roberts cried, in half-hearted protest,\u000afor every inch of his six feet of young body was aching dully, "that\u000aleg of yours--"\u000a\u000a"Is a corker," said the Captain shortly.
p9616
aV"H'm.
p9617
aVCome along,\u000aSullivan."
p9618
aVAn hour later the two, staggering with sleep, herded the last of the\u000asodden, half-delirious stragglers up to the fire which spluttered in\u000athe wet and gloom, and the sick men sprawled obediently among their\u000aunconscious fellows.
p9619
aVFor an instant the officer stared down at them.
p9620
aV"Hopeful lot, ain't they?"
p9621
aVhe muttered.
p9622
aV"H'm."
p9623
aV"It sure looks some like a graveyard, Captain," said Sullivan\u000acheerfully.
p9624
aVThe Captain glanced at him again.
p9625
aV"Don't you ever get--blue, Sullivan?"
p9626
aVhe asked curiously.
p9627
aVSullivan seemed doubtful.
p9628
aV"I--I do' know's I ever thought much about\u000ait, sir," he said.
p9629
aV"I reckoned not," said the Captain.
p9630
aV"H'm.
p9631
aVWell, don't.
p9632
aVGo to\u000asleep."
p9633
aV"I was thinkin' I'd keep th' fire goin' a while, it looked so kind of\u000ahomelike," Sullivan objected.
p9634
aV"I ain't much sleepy.
p9635
aVYou turn in,\u000asir."
p9636
aV"I'm not sleepy, either," said the other gruffly.
p9637
aV"H'm.
p9638
aVRoll in\u000anow.
p9639
aV_Pronto_."
p9640
aVObediently Sullivan sank down where he stood, and\u000awas asleep.
p9641
aVBurrell sat long, brooding over the fire, listening to the deep\u000abreaths and smothered groanings of his men.
p9642
aVOne of them babbled in\u000adelirium, piteously, for a moment, and the Captain went and soothed\u000ahim, awkwardly.
p9643
aVThen he stood above him, gazing off into the gulf of\u000ablackness to the west.
p9644
aVHe glanced down at the muttering soldier, and\u000aaway again into the night.
p9645
aV"God damn you," he said to the Island of\u000aSamar gravely, courteously, as one might deliver a challenge to\u000amortal combat.
p9646
aVNext morning they breakfasted on what was left of their food,\u000aconsuming all but a precious emergency ration of two tins of bacon, a\u000apound and a half in all.
p9647
aVThen they pushed on in what was meant to be\u000aa last desperate dash for the coast, going down into a long wide\u000avalley smothered in primeval forest.
p9648
aVEvery trail had vanished, each\u000astep of advance had to be slashed from a jungle of underbrush and\u000acreepers, and for all their suffering they gained a scant five miles.
p9649
aVThey halted at nightfall in a little opening, where they shed their\u000aequipments as they stood, and sprawled among them.
p9650
aVSullivan and the\u000aCaptain, going back for the many stragglers, failed to discover two\u000aof them.
p9651
aVThey camped that night without food or fire, in a rain that came down\u000aharder than ever, if such a thing could be.
p9652
aVNext day, without\u000abreakfast, they resumed their dogged advance, halting often to rest\u000aand search for food.
p9653
aVBut in that dead season the forest yielded\u000anothing more edible than leaves and bark, and a few woody seed pods\u000alike rose-haws in size and shape.
p9654
aV"Hell-apples," Sullivan named those, after he had had opportunity to\u000aobserve their effects.
p9655
aV"They look all right, and they taste all\u000aright," he explained, "but they sure do raise hell with your insides."
p9656
aVThe men munched them greedily, despite their uncomforting properties.
p9657
aVA time was coming when a rotting log that harbored store of grubs\u000awould seem a treasure-house to them.
p9658
aVThe bayonets did not hack out a trail as rapidly as they had on the\u000aday before, and they had made no more than three miles and a half\u000awhen night shut down.
p9659
aVYet, slow as the advance was, only half a\u000adozen men were up with it, and, when Burrell would have gone back for\u000athe others, his wounded leg crumpled under him.
p9660
aVWithout a word,\u000aLieutenant Roberts joined Sullivan, and it was midnight when the pair\u000abrought in the last straggler they could find.
p9661
aVThree were still\u000amissing, and the Captain forbade further search.
p9662
aV"They'll have to\u000atake a chance," he said.
p9663
aV"H'm."
p9664
aVWhen the next day broke, merely a lightening of the gloom under the\u000adripping branches, Lieutenant Roberts rose stiffly from the pool that\u000ahad formed about him in the night and stood, blue-lipped and shaking,\u000aover the Captain, whose tortured leg would not permit him to do more\u000athan raise himself on one elbow.
p9665
aVThe two officers faced the\u000asituation together.
p9666
aVThey needed no words.
p9667
aVAll about them lay the\u000aforest of that deadly central valley.
p9668
aVSomewhere beyond it,\u000aunattainably far for the majority of the men, rose the western\u000arampart of the island.
p9669
aVFor thirty-six hours they had had no food but\u000ahell-apples, the fever was growing on them, and three-fourths of the\u000acommand, any doctor would have said, could not march a mile.
p9670
aVThe Captain spoke at last, staring sullenly at the ground.
p9671
aV"Call the\u000amen, will you?"
p9672
aVhe asked.
p9673
aV"H'm.
p9674
aVI reckon it's time to split."
p9675
aVRoberts' face brightened.
p9676
aV"I'll make it out all right," he declared.
p9677
aV"Never felt huskier in my life.
p9678
aVI could break world's records from\u000ahere to a plate of grub."
p9679
aVOnly ten men of the seventeen who were left responded to the call.
p9680
aVThe others, roused from the stupor of deep sleep, merely stared up\u000avacantly and muttered, so Roberts let them lie.
p9681
aV"Boys," said\u000aBurrell, when they had formed a little circle round him, "'most of us\u000aneed a lay-off.
p9682
aVH'm.
p9683
aVSo we're goin' to rest up here for a couple of\u000adays and then push on slow.
p9684
aVMr. Roberts and a couple of you can plug\u000aahead now, though, so's to have some grub cooked up to meet us.
p9685
aVI\u000areckon we'll raise a famine in Nalang.
p9686
aVH'm.
p9687
aVRoberts, who'll you\u000atake with you?"
p9688
aVDespite the lightness of the officer's tone, every man knew what he\u000aasked for, and as the subaltern's eyes swept round the circle,\u000ashrewdly weighing each man's serviceability, shoulders squared and\u000afaces took on looks of quite ferocious good cheer.
p9689
aV"I seen you first, sir," Terry Clancy cried all at once, and stumbled\u000ato his feet.
p9690
aV"I've got a fine healthy appetite, myself," Sullivan remarked\u000aplaintively.
p9691
aV"I'm with you for a sprint, Lieutenant."
p9692
aV"You're too old, Clancy," said Roberts kindly.
p9693
aV"I want yearlings for\u000athis.
p9694
aVAnd you, Sullivan,"--his voice held good-natured\u000acondescension, as he glanced down at his own bulging chest and sturdy\u000alimbs,--"you're too spindly.
p9695
aVYou're liable to double up, any time."
p9696
aVAt last he chose Red Hannigan and Peter Kelley, two men of his own\u000akind, bull-necked, thick-limbed and heavy-shouldered.
p9697
aVThe Captain\u000ahanded him one of the two tins of bacon.
p9698
aV"We'll look for you back,"\u000ahe said, "long about--H'm--day after to-morrow.
p9699
aVOr day after that.
p9700
aVH'm."
p9701
aVThe eyes of the officers glinted into each other.
p9702
aV"Sure," said\u000aRoberts, gravely shaking his commander's hand.
p9703
aV"Come along, you\u000afellows."
p9704
aVTwelve days later a party from Nalang found Lieutenant Roberts, the\u000afirst white man to win across Samar, sitting contentedly on the beach\u000ain the sunshine, forty miles above the town, eating snails and\u000aaimlessly tossing the shells at what had been his feet.
p9705
aVRed Hannigan\u000aand Peter Kelley were never found, for Roberts never could remember\u000awhere they left him.
p9706
aVAfter the departure of the rescue party, apathy settled over the camp\u000ain the valley.
p9707
aVThe Captain straightened his bad leg and lay back\u000awith closed eyes.
p9708
aVThe others lay about him, dozing.
p9709
aVEven the worst\u000aof the fever-victims only cried out occasionally.
p9710
aVBeside the relief\u000aof not having to march, cold and wet and hunger and sickness were\u000alittle things.
p9711
aVIt was well on in the afternoon when Clancy was roused by a sound\u000awhich puzzled him.
p9712
aVStumbling out of camp, he came upon a sight which\u000astruck him speechless.
p9713
aVSullivan, sitting astride a mouldering log, was wrenching off strips\u000aof sodden bark and digging his fingers deep into the punky wood.
p9714
aVSuddenly the meaning of it burst on Terry.
p9715
aV"Quit that!"
p9716
aVhe cried.
p9717
aV"Quit it, I tell you."
p9718
aVSullivan, glancing up, had the grace to redden.
p9719
aVThen he lowered his\u000aeyes, and resumed his pecking.
p9720
aV"I don't care," he muttered\u000adefiantly.
p9721
aV"I'm hungry enough to eat anything."
p9722
aVClancy turned away.
p9723
aVPresently, from behind a clump of undergrowth,\u000athere came the sound of ripping bark.
p9724
aVFor a while Sullivan, still\u000abusy, preserved discreet silence.
p9725
aVBut his grin broadened slowly, and\u000aat last he sang out, "Hi, Terry!
p9726
aVPick for the little white ones.
p9727
aVThe others has kind of soured, I reckon."
p9728
aVThere was no answer.
p9729
aVAfter a time another man limped out, watched\u000aSullivan for a little, and soon the sounds of the chase rose from\u000aanother secluded spot.
p9730
aVThere was no element of sociability in those\u000ameals as yet.
p9731
aVThen came a slow succession of days not so tremendously hard to bear,\u000aas the pangs of hunger faded into the milder discomfort of\u000astarvation, and the fever felled them one by one.
p9732
aVDays so like each\u000aother that only the calendar notched in the grip of the Captain's\u000arevolver kept their count.
p9733
aVEach morning fewer of them were able to join Sullivan in the search\u000afor grubs and seed pods, and he began bringing them what spoil of the\u000aforest he could find.
p9734
aVThey took it unquestioningly from his hand,\u000athose who were conscious, like children.
p9735
aVIndeed, as the days passed,\u000athe rough fellows turned for all their needs to the man who had been\u000atheir butt, and he never failed to meet their primitive wants.
p9736
aVThat\u000alanky body of his held a surprising store of tough endurance, and he\u000aseemed fever-proof.
p9737
aVAs for his cheerfulness, it was inexhaustible.
p9738
aVBig Terry Clancy and the Captain were the last to yield to their\u000aweakness, refusing, gently, the food Sullivan brought them.
p9739
aVHard men\u000aas those of B were, not one of them, in his sane moments, spoke a\u000aword of discontent or of complaint during those days.
p9740
aVI like to\u000aremember that of them, as I like to remember that I never heard an\u000aAmerican regular soldier, traditional grumbler that he is, grumble\u000awhen he had a reason for it.
p9741
aVOn the fourth evening after the departure of Lieutenant Roberts, the\u000atenth night out from Sabey and the fifth since they had eaten food\u000afor human beings, Sullivan was the only man left stirring in the\u000acamp.
p9742
aVIn spite of the rain--and I would have you read always to the\u000atorrential beat of a tropical downpour and the soughing of cold,\u000adamp-laden winds--he had managed, with the last of the matches and\u000athe powder from half a dozen cartridges, to kindle a fire in a fallen\u000atrunk, and had kept it going, and had dragged his comrades round it.
p9743
aVHe sat beside the Captain, and presently, glancing down, he saw that\u000athe officer's eyes were fixed steadily on him.
p9744
aV"Anything you want,\u000asir?"
p9745
aVhe asked.
p9746
aV"How many of us," Burrell asked abruptly, "are what you could call\u000afit?"
p9747
aVSullivan surveyed the prostrate men about him.
p9748
aV"Well," he said\u000aimperturbably, "I reckon there's me.
p9749
aVAnd you."
p9750
aV"H'm," the Captain grunted, and even in his sickness his eyes\u000abrightened.
p9751
aV"Then," he said, "I reckon it's up to--us.
p9752
aVH'm."
p9753
aVFor a moment he mused, and then he went on, "It's no use trying\u000aNalang.
p9754
aVRoberts tried that.
p9755
aVBut if some one could get back to Sabey\u000aI think some of the men would try--"\u000a\u000a"The boys would get you out of hell, sir," said Sullivan gravely, "if\u000ayou sent th'm word."
p9756
aV"Think so?"
p9757
aVsaid Burrell.
p9758
aV"H'm.
p9759
aVWell, to-morrow you'd better send\u000aword to 'em."
p9760
aVThe Captain's eyes had a queer brightness as he stared\u000aat Sullivan, reading his face.
p9761
aV"H'm," he muttered at last, "if I\u000aever do have to get a message out of there, I hope you'll be round to\u000acarry it."
p9762
aVSomething in his tone dragged Sullivan toward him with suddenly\u000ablazing eyes.
p9763
aV"Captain," he begged, demanding assurance from the man\u000awho was his deity, "do you mean that?
p9764
aVNo jollyin' now, sir.
p9765
aVYou\u000asure think I can do it?"
p9766
aV"Think?"
p9767
aVsaid the Captain.
p9768
aV"H'm.
p9769
aVI'm bankin' on you, Sullivan.
p9770
aVI\u000aknow you can do it."
p9771
aV"Then," said Sullivan blissfully, "by God, I will, sir."
p9772
aVEarly as it was next morning when Sullivan rose for his start, he\u000afound the Captain's steady eyes on him.
p9773
aV"You don't need your rifle,"\u000ahe said.
p9774
aV"Nor your belt."
p9775
aV"I reckon not, sir," said Sullivan whimsically, "not for buggin'."
p9776
aV"You take that can of bacon out of my haversack," his officer\u000acontinued.
p9777
aV"I've saved it for this."
p9778
aV"I don't need it none, sir," said Sullivan, edging away.
p9779
aV"There'd\u000aought to be fine buggin' back along.
p9780
aVAn' hell-apples, I reckon."
p9781
aV"Take it," said Burrell shortly, and Sullivan yielded to the habit of\u000aobedience.
p9782
aVHe turned for his journey.
p9783
aV"Hold on," his officer commanded.
p9784
aV"You're forgettin' something."
p9785
aVHe\u000alifted a clawlike hand, and Sullivan gripped it for a minute in\u000asilence.
p9786
aVHe strode across the little opening to the beginning of the\u000aback trail.
p9787
aVThere he halted, turned, and hurled the tin of bacon at\u000ahis commander.
p9788
aV"You go to hell, sir," he shrilled defiantly.
p9789
aV"I'll\u000ado fine, buggin',"--and he ran stumblingly down the trail.
p9790
aVThe Captain twisted his head--it was the only movement he could\u000amake--and watched the retreating figure of the mutineer.
p9791
aV"H'm," he\u000amuttered after it, and shut his eyes, to wait.
p9792
aVFor the first few hours Sullivan, uplifted by the thought of his\u000amission, went on at what seemed to him a tremendous pace.
p9793
aVIn reality\u000ahis knees lifted jerkily, his feet came down flat and stiff, and his\u000astride was that of a child.
p9794
aVA giddiness, too, overtook him now and\u000athen, and a white mist drifted before his eyes.
p9795
aVAt such times the\u000awalls of the trail seemed to rush by in a blur of green, and he had\u000aan exhilarating sense of rapid movement.
p9796
aVLong before noon he had covered the three miles and a half to the\u000afirst camp on the back trail.
p9797
aVThere he hesitated.
p9798
aVA temptingly\u000acrumbly log lay beside the trail, and his stomach was cramped with\u000asuch hunger as he had not felt for days.
p9799
aVBut he halted only a\u000amoment.
p9800
aV"Time enough to eat to-night," he muttered, and went on.
p9801
aVThe afternoon was harder.
p9802
aVThe giddiness and the mist assailed him\u000aoftener, and several times, when the blankness became complete, he\u000awas roused by finding that his face had come into not ungentle\u000acontact with the ground.
p9803
aVOnce, doubling limply, he struck his face\u000aon his knee instead, and a cut lip gave him the pleasant salty taste\u000aof blood.
p9804
aVSharp pains of breathlessness stabbed his sides at\u000aintervals, and his heart had fits of throbbing suffocatingly.
p9805
aVBut he\u000anever halted as long as he could see.
p9806
aVWhen the trail was only\u000ablackness in the night he sank down.
p9807
aVThe rain and the light woke him to an accusing sense that it had long\u000abeen day.
p9808
aVHe moved on at once.
p9809
aV"I'll eat when I've made that up,"\u000ahe muttered, as the blur enclosed him.
p9810
aVThat day was mostly blur until, along in the afternoon, his mind\u000acleared suddenly.
p9811
aVThe ground sloped upward under his feet.
p9812
aVA rocky,\u000asparsely-wooded ridge rose above him.
p9813
aVRemembrance tingled through\u000ahim.
p9814
aV"My cactus-farm!"
p9815
aVhe cried, in delighted recognition.
p9816
aV"I'm\u000agettin' almost there."
p9817
aVWith his knees doubling under him, he clawed his way to the ridge,\u000aand a well-remembered landscape lay about him, dark billows of\u000aunbroken forest and a horizon of up-tumbled hills.
p9818
aVThe huge\u000aemptiness of it smote him like a blow and he turned to the old camp.
p9819
aVThe signs of human occupation, the remembrance of men who had spoken\u000athere and of the words they had said, comforted him wonderfully.
p9820
aV"Here," he said, having fallen into a way of thinking aloud, "is\u000awhere I _eat_.
p9821
aVThey'd ought to be fine buggin' here."
p9822
aVBut the ridge was disappointingly bare of provender.
p9823
aVNot a rotten\u000alog, not a seed pod, rewarded his toilsome search.
p9824
aVAt last, where a\u000ahanging corner of rock had sheltered it, he came upon a torpid colony\u000aof tiger-ants.
p9825
aVHe looked at them dubiously.
p9826
aV"I wonder," he\u000amuttered, "if anybody ever _et_ an ant?
p9827
aVI reckon not.
p9828
aVDon't seem to\u000abe much _to_ th'm."
p9829
aVAs he stirred the sluggish insects with a doubtful finger, one of\u000athem set its mandibles in his flesh.
p9830
aVSullivan's eyes lit with\u000adetermination.
p9831
aV"I'm hungrier'n you be, I reckon," he said gravely.
p9832
aVWith the refreshing acidity of his experiment strong on his tongue,\u000ahe rose at last, regretfully.
p9833
aV"It would seem kind of home-like\u000asleepin' here," he said.
p9834
aV"But I reckon I'd better be gallopin'\u000aalong."
p9835
aVAnd he pushed on till once more darkness brought him\u000amerciful oblivion.
p9836
aVHe woke to daylight with all his senses clear but one.
p9837
aVHe\u000aunderstood--there had been times when he forgot even that--that he\u000awas Sullivan, that behind him lay his comrades, starving, that before\u000ahim the trail led to men who needed but a word, and that he had been\u000achosen to take it.
p9838
aVBut his sense of time was gone.
p9839
aVHow long he had\u000aslept he could not guess.
p9840
aVIt might have been one night, or many.
p9841
aVThey might all have died behind him, those sick men and the Old Man\u000awho banked on him.
p9842
aVIn torture at the uncertainty, he rose and stumbled forward again.
p9843
aVAfter a while--it might have been an hour or many days--the trail\u000abrought him to a torrential river.
p9844
aVHe recognized it dimly as the\u000aSabey.
p9845
aVThey had come up it once, sometime, any time, walking in its\u000arocky bed.
p9846
aVNow its swirling waters covered the trail.
p9847
aVPainstakingly Sullivan collected his misty faculties.
p9848
aVThere was a\u000ageneral feeling of morning in the air.
p9849
aVBy night he must be at Sabey,\u000ahe was convinced.
p9850
aVHe must hurry, therefore.
p9851
aVA clear idea flashed\u000aacross his mind.
p9852
aVA raft!
p9853
aVHe must build a raft and hurry with the\u000arushing river, since there was no more trail.
p9854
aVHe drew his heavy\u000aknife-bayonet and turned to the woods.
p9855
aVAfter a while darkness shut\u000adown and stopped his work.
p9856
aVBut he had cut a good many poles.
p9857
aVThe next thing he knew it was light again, so he dragged one of his\u000apoles to the river and dropped it in.
p9858
aVIt sank.
p9859
aVAnother and another\u000adid the same.
p9860
aVWhen they touched the water they sank.
p9861
aVWhen Sullivan\u000aunderstood that his poles would not float, he lost his steady\u000ahopefulness for the first time.
p9862
aVBut after a while he turned wearily, and stumbled off along the\u000arocky, overhanging banks of Sabey River.
p9863
aVWhen he had walked dizzily\u000aa little distance, he fell and lay still.
p9864
aVA fall on that cutting\u000avolcanic rock was another matter from a fall on the trail.
p9865
aVAt last\u000ahe recovered enough to stagger on for a few more steps.
p9866
aVThen he fell\u000aagain.
p9867
aVThat time he did not rise.
p9868
aVBut the shock and the loss of blood cleared his head.
p9869
aVAt last he\u000arecognized his predicament.
p9870
aVHe was through.
p9871
aVThere was no bitterness\u000ain the thought.
p9872
aVHe had done his best, and failed.
p9873
aVThe torment of\u000ahurry was gone, and he lay and watched the foaming river and the\u000aoverarching trees.
p9874
aV"I can't do it," Sullivan told himself simply,\u000aand quit.
p9875
aVBut suddenly his merciless self assailed him.
p9876
aV"There's another way,"\u000ait urged.
p9877
aV"You can do it.
p9878
aVTh' Old Man said so.
p9879
aVTry it."
p9880
aVWeakly, half-sobbing, Sullivan obeyed the summons, and got to his\u000aknees.
p9881
aVHe put out a hand and planted it on the rock, drew up his\u000aknee toward it, and his body swayed forward.
p9882
aVHe put out his other\u000ahand, drew up his other knee, swayed forward again.
p9883
aVHe had gained a\u000afoot, at least.
p9884
aV"By God," shouted Sullivan's self to him exultantly, "you can do it!
p9885
aVTry it again.
p9886
aVYou can't walk, but you can _crawl_, I reckon.
p9887
aVWhoop-eee-ee!
p9888
aVHit her up!"
p9889
aVAnd Sullivan, obedient as always, hit her up.
p9890
aVAnd so at last, seventeen days from the time he left Sabey, he\u000areturned to it, a blind, gaunt, rain-beaten, silent, grimly crawling\u000athing.
p9891
aVHe had almost reached the barracks when a soldier, hurrying\u000athrough the rain, spied him and raised a shout.
p9892
aVHe revived for a\u000amoment when they lifted him, and opened his eyes.
p9893
aV"Back along," faltered the messenger.
p9894
aV"Starvin'.
p9895
aVHurry up.
p9896
aVGod!"
p9897
aVhe sighed, and collapsed in their arms.
p9898
aVThey carried him to the shack they called a hospital, and while the\u000arelief party gathered and went out, twenty silent men loaded down\u000awith rations, the post surgeon and his wife worked over him.
p9899
aVSuddenly the girl broke down.
p9900
aV"Oh!"
p9901
aVshe cried.
p9902
aV"Look at his poor hands and knees!
p9903
aVOh, Will, what\u000adid _that_ to him?"
p9904
aV"What?"
p9905
aVstuttered the young surgeon gruffly.
p9906
aV"What!
p9907
aVWhy, the--the\u000anervy son--son of a gun _walked_ on 'em, God knows how far, that's\u000aall!
p9908
aVFill those water bottles, will you.
p9909
aVAnd _hurry_ up."
p9910
aVTwo days later Sullivan opened his eyes, and stared wonderingly at\u000athe room, and the lamplight, and the _olla_ hanging in the window,\u000aand the post surgeon's pretty wife, who sat beside his cot.
p9911
aVAt last\u000ahis eyes rested on his own hands, shapeless in bandages.
p9912
aVAnd as he\u000alooked at them his lips trembled, and he began to cry, weakly, like a\u000achild.
p9913
aVThe post surgeon's wife thought she understood, and her own breath\u000acaught.
p9914
aVShe was very new to the Army, and she was trying to make a\u000ahero of Sullivan.
p9915
aV"Poor fellow," she murmured, "I know they're bad.
p9916
aVBut we'll fix them up.
p9917
aVDon't cry about them."
p9918
aV"I ain't c-cryin'!"
p9919
aVSullivan whispered, in tremulous indignation.
p9920
aV"I'm l-laughin'.
p9921
aVI reckon," he muttered, and a ripple of the old\u000awhimsicality swept across his face, "I must be about th' first man\u000aever wore his hands to a blister, walkin'."
p9922
aVThe wonder of the\u000athought held him entranced.
p9923
aVThe girl thought he was light-headed.
p9924
aV"Is there anything you'd\u000alike?"
p9925
aVshe asked soothingly.
p9926
aVSullivan considered.
p9927
aV"Salt," he announced emphatically.
p9928
aV"I want\u000asalt.
p9929
aVEv'ry drop you've got in th' place.
p9930
aVWhat're you lookin' at?
p9931
aVSalt's cheap enough, ain't it?
p9932
aVWell, I want some.
p9933
aVSeems like I\u000ahadn't had no salt f'r years."
p9934
aVHow the relief party did its work is another story, and a brave one.
p9935
aVIt is hard to kill strong men by exhaustion, and, by the time\u000aSullivan could walk a little, the Captain and the other rescued men\u000awere sitting up in bed.
p9936
aVAt last a day came when Burrell was\u000apermitted to have one visitor.
p9937
aV"Send Sullivan," he ordered.
p9938
aVThe lanky fellow shuffled in bashfully, and stood with averted eyes.
p9939
aV"Glad to see you're back, sir," he muttered.
p9940
aV"Well," asked Burrell gruffly, "you can shake hands, can't you?"
p9941
aVSullivan, grinning sheepishly, held up a muffled paw.
p9942
aV"I reckon not,\u000asir," he said.
p9943
aV"What's the matter with 'em?"
p9944
aVthe Captain demanded.
p9945
aV"Blistered th'm, sir," Sullivan responded with solemn joy.
p9946
aV"Blistered th'm, walkin'."
p9947
aV"H'm," the Captain muttered.
p9948
aVHis eyes were burning into the man.
p9949
aV"Sullivan," he said abruptly, "there's a can of bacon in my haversack\u000athat belongs to you."
p9950
aVSullivan gulped.
p9951
aVDiscipline had him by the heels again.
p9952
aV"Beg y'\u000apardon, sir," he mumbled nervously.
p9953
aV"I reckon I must a been sort of\u000aloco that day."
p9954
aV"Well," said the Old Man of B Company gravely, "maybe I'll let it go\u000athis time.
p9955
aVBut see it don't happen again.
p9956
aVH'm."
p9957
aVCHAPTER X\u000a\u000aTHIS FORTUNE\u000a\u000aThis Fortune you speak of, tell me, what sort of creature is she, to\u000ahave the good things of the world so in her hands?--_The Inferno of\u000aDante Alighieri_.
p9958
aVThe second of my Argonauts was of quite another sort.
p9959
aVWhatever\u000agraces of body and mind Nature has to give, she had given him--and he\u000ahad wasted them.
p9960
aVWith his invincible and dauntless youth he might\u000ahave been a companion for Cortez and stout Bernal Diaz, a Crusader,\u000aalmost anything he chose, and he was--I borrow the phrase of a better\u000aman than I--a Camp-Follower of Fortune, a wasted man.
p9961
aVThe outskirts\u000aof the world are full of them.
p9962
aVThat such things can be, that men can\u000abe born so strong, so lovable, and then be wasted, seems to me the\u000amost inexplicable of the caprices of that Fortune which puzzled Dante\u000aAlighieri long ago.
p9963
aVMid-heaven high, the morning sun blazed above the forlorn little\u000alumber-port, calling the inhabitants thereof to arise and make hay\u000adiligently during the few weeks it still had to shine before the\u000achange of monsoons and the rainy season blotted the world in mist.
p9964
aVThe call seemed to arouse little enthusiasm.
p9965
aVOver the channel, where\u000athe Rio Bagalayag winds out by the bar, a pair of gulls wheeled\u000aaimlessly, plunging into the yellow water now and then, and rising\u000awith harsh cries.
p9966
aVOut beyond them in the distance, where Point\u000aBagalayag wavered in the heat, a lorcha drifted with limp sails,\u000abecalmed in the lee of Mount Bagalayag.
p9967
aVIn the one street of\u000aBagalayag itself, the grassy lane which follows the curve of the\u000ashore, two Chinamen with a long whip-saw were gnawing a plank from a\u000afour-foot log of molave, sawing steadily with the patient endurance\u000aof their race, brown arms swinging in and out, brown bodies swaying.
p9968
aVAt the end of each stroke, they grunted rhythmically, and the music\u000aof their industry--_Ugh!
p9969
aVKch-chee-e-e-Arghh!
p9970
aVKch-chee-e-e-Ugh!_--was the only sound in Bagalayag that morning,\u000asave the raucous complaint of the distant gulls.
p9971
aVAs a matter of fact, Bagalayag was waiting in hushed expectancy for\u000asomething inevitable to happen.
p9972
aVOn the shady side of the nipa\u000achurch, which still manages to rear its rickety walls at the corner\u000aof the brown and weedy _plaza_, the populace was gathered--forty-one\u000amen, fifty-two women, fifty-two babes in arms, and seventy-three\u000achildren of varying sex and age, speechless for once, with the smoke\u000aof their cigarettes dissolving above them like unfragrant incense.
p9973
aVAnd the gaze of all that multitude was fixed unwinkingly on a\u000atin-roofed house--the only one in town--which stands on the other\u000aside of the street, close to the water's edge.
p9974
aVIn that pretentious dwelling an unprecedented event seemed likely to\u000ahappen, for in its upper chamber one of the lords of the earth lay\u000adeathly sick of a fever.
p9975
aVBagalayag as yet recorded no death of a\u000awhite man in its simple annals, therefore it sat and smoked and\u000awaited, all except its stolid, alien Chinamen, who cared nothing for\u000alife or death or anything but planks.
p9976
aVOccasionally a voice floated out from the Tin-Roofed House, weak and\u000athin but full of helpless rage, and at the sound the inhabitants of\u000aBagalayag wagged their heads and spoke softly.
p9977
aV"The Seor Ess-soffti\u000ais not dead--yet," they murmured.
p9978
aVIn Hamburg, far enough from Bagalayag in miles, there is a house\u000awhich sells anything, from elephants to orchids.
p9979
aVEvery product of\u000athe animal or vegetable kingdom from one pole to the other, 'round\u000awith the equator and back again, is included in the complete line\u000awhich the _Hamburgische Gesellschaft_ carries, for this body is a\u000atrue body whose busy nerve-ends net the round world.
p9980
aVMen on grimy\u000aships whose battered fore feet are set across uncharted leagues of\u000asea, men who rot in unheard-of towns--yet continue to live and trade\u000ain defiance of every hygienic law--men who plod untracked continents\u000aand unknown, sleeping islands with savage followers, are the organs\u000aby which it acts.
p9981
aVSet above all these is the good Right Eye of the Company, the man\u000awho, by virtue of wild-wood lore and craftsmanship, and first-hand\u000aknowledge of the far nooks and byways of the earth, by right of\u000aenergy and perseverance, outranks the army of traders and collectors\u000aand stands next the Brain.
p9982
aVHerr Felix Schrofft is his name, always\u000aspoken with respect and envy by his associates and rivals in his\u000astrong man's calling.
p9983
aVAnd now, become the Seor Ess-soffti on liquid\u000aMalay tongues, he lay alone at bay in the Tin-Roofed House, and held\u000athe breathless attention of the populace of Bagalayag in Mindoro.
p9984
aVThe arena where he fought, that small, bare, upper chamber, was very\u000asimply furnished with a round table, a couple of chairs, a\u000acamphor-wood chest, a bamboo cage imprisoning a parrot, and a folding\u000acot upholstered in the severest taste with dingy gray canvas.
p9985
aVThe\u000atable held the fly- and lizard-bitten remnants of a meal, the chairs\u000awere draped with the muddy garments their owner had flung there\u000ahastily three days before, a litter of other clothing sprawled from\u000abeneath the lid of the chest, and on the cot, which stood before a\u000aseaward-facing window, was stretched the redoubtable Seor Ess-soffti\u000ahimself, not at all in the mental attitude which our Christian\u000aconvention prescribes for those _in articulo mortis_.
p9986
aVDespite the\u000apallor of the cheeks beneath the smut of the newly sprouted beard and\u000athe yellow gleam of the eyeballs and the leaden inertness of the\u000ashrunken limbs which barely hollowed the taut canvas where they lay,\u000athe shaggy, wizened monkey of a man was plainly beset by the very\u000aworst of tempers, which only his extreme weakness kept from violent\u000aexpression.
p9987
aVSo he lay chafing there that morning, just as he had lain for days.
p9988
aVOccasionally his restless eyes met the beady ones of the parrot, and\u000athe imprisoned bird shrieked with silly laughter.
p9989
aVOn such occasions\u000athe Seor Ess-soffti shook his fist, a menace which showed mostly in\u000athe convulsions of his face, and muttered weakly, "Sing, you deffel,\u000asing!"
p9990
aVfalling thereafter into a murmured torrent of words, as he\u000aconsigned the Philippine Islands and all things in them to\u000aeverlasting torment.
p9991
aVEven a hidebound moralist, knowing all the circumstances, might have\u000afound some palliation for Herr Schrofft's unspiritual estate.
p9992
aVFever\u000ahad stricken him at an inopportune season, and, for the first time in\u000ahis life, he faced a possibility of failure with which he could not\u000acope.
p9993
aVEven now the freighter _Sarstoon_ had turned her stubby nose\u000aMindoro-ward at Schrofft's suggestion.
p9994
aVIn ten days she would be\u000alying off Bagalayag, waiting for the cargo he had promised her, and\u000aeven when one has no fever, ten days are little time in which to fell\u000aand trim a hundred cubic meters of a wood so dense that it eats an\u000aaxe like granulated metal, and float it down the miles of oozing mud\u000athey call the Rio Bagalayag, and load it before the northeast\u000amonsoon--already threatening in the clouds--comes to lash the open\u000aroadstead into a fury of spume and breaking rollers.
p9995
aVHe could foresee it all, the excessive sympathy of the _Sarstoon's_\u000askipper, the meek explanation of the House to the impatient customer,\u000athe commiseration and sly elation of his acquaintances and rivals\u000athat he had failed at last, the universal grunt of "Hard luck,\u000aSchrofft"--hard luck in a trade whose frankly brutal creed discredits\u000aa man for one adverse stroke of fortune as for any other sign of\u000apersonal weakness and unfitness.
p9996
aVAll that must come, unless he could\u000afind some means of thwarting Dame Fate.
p9997
aVAnd so, not finding the\u000ameans, he cursed the officious beldame heartily.
p9998
aVSuddenly he noticed that the drone of the saw had ceased.
p9999
aVDoubtless\u000athe coolies had stopped to wipe their streaming faces, but Schrofft\u000awas in no mood to seek excuses for them.
p10000
aV"Loaf, you deffels, loaf!"
p10001
aVhe shouted venomously.
p10002
aVAs if in response to his taunt, the music of the saw began again, but\u000amingled with it came the chatter of many voices and the soft flop,\u000aflop of many padding feet.
p10003
aVRaising his head a wearisome half-inch to\u000apeer from his window, Herr Schrofft saw, with supreme disgust, the\u000asprung masts and frowsy rigging of the monthly packet from Batangas\u000ain the river.
p10004
aVSomehow or other the hours had dragged by uncounted;\u000ait was afternoon, and the crazy lorcha had drifted to her haven in\u000aspite of calm and childish seamanship; while he, Herr Schrofft the\u000aindomitable, had one day less in which to do his work.
p10005
aVFor the first\u000atime in his illness, the hard-pressed little man groaned for\u000asympathy, and pitying, sentimental, Teutonic tears burned his eyes.
p10006
aV"If I only had just one white man with me," he muttered.
p10007
aVThe confusion without came nearer, drawing down the street, and\u000apresently the stairs of the Tin-Roofed House clattered under booted\u000afeet and its fabric trembled slightly.
p10008
aVThe invalid's face brightened\u000awith curiosity.
p10009
aVNo native of the Philippines has the combined weight\u000aand energy necessary to make a house shake when he walks.
p10010
aV_Deus ex\u000aMachina!_ That was a favorite phrase of Schrofft's, almost the only\u000aLatin of Gymnasium days that had stuck.
p10011
aVPerhaps the Man had come\u000awith the Hour.
p10012
aVSchrofft watched the door with feverish intentness.
p10013
aVIt opened and a white man entered, white at least in fundamental\u000acoloring, although his skin was a raw, beefy red from newly acquired\u000asunburn, tall, broad-shouldered, clad serviceably in sombrero, the\u000arelic of an army shirt, the ruins of khaki riding-breeches and, most\u000aincongruously, a pair of handsome riding-boots, whose russet leather\u000awas cleaned and polished till it glittered.
p10014
aVSo far all was well, but\u000athe face--the hollowed cheeks, the dark puffy rims beneath the eyes,\u000athe wavering glance of the bright blue eyes themselves, the nervous\u000atwitching of the full red lips, set in a smile of deprecating\u000aimpudence, the keen, high-bred features blunted and battered by\u000adissipation, all spoke of one thing.
p10015
aVSchrofft sized up his visitor\u000awith narrowed lids, and spoke his opinion briefly.
p10016
aV"I haf no use for\u000abums," he said.
p10017
aVLike a mask, the wheedling smirk dropped from the newcomer's face.
p10018
aV"Hock the Kaiser, a wandering Dutchman!"
p10019
aVhe cried airily, advancing\u000ato the cot.
p10020
aVSchrofft's little eyes burned red.
p10021
aV"I am Herr Felix Schrofft,\u000aExplorer for the _Hamburgische Gesellschaft_," he said with dignity,\u000a"and I haf no use for bums.
p10022
aVGet out."
p10023
aV"'Tis a certain matter of delayed remittances," the stranger\u000aexplained, as he unceremoniously dumped the encumbering garments from\u000aa chair, and sat down by the table.
p10024
aV"I must identify myself, Herr\u000aSofty.
p10025
aVI am Richard Roe, Esquire, ward of the famous John Doe, of\u000awhom you may have heard.
p10026
aVWhile the remittances delay, I wander,\u000aseeking whom and what I may devour."
p10027
aVMr. Richard Roe gazed ruefully\u000aat the dusty viands before him.
p10028
aV"As usual, I seem to have come to\u000athe wrong shop," he murmured.
p10029
aV"But here at least are cigarettes.
p10030
aVI\u000awill not stand on ceremony."
p10031
aVWhile the match flared, Schrofft stared at his tormentor with at\u000aleast as much of bewilderment as of wrath.
p10032
aV"If I could hold my\u000arevolver," he said at last, "I think I would shoot you.
p10033
aVI haf no use\u000afor bums."
p10034
aVThrough a cloud of smoke, Mr. Richard Roe gazed whimsically at the\u000ainvalid.
p10035
aV"The question seems to be," he suggested mildly, "whether\u000athe bum has a use for you.
p10036
aVAnd I rather think he has."
p10037
aVHe crossed\u000aone leg over the other and became pleasantly didactic.
p10038
aV"I am not\u000aalways what you see me now, Herr Softy.
p10039
aVOne short week ago I sat in\u000aDon Miguel Rafferty's establishment in Batangas, wooing fickle\u000aFortune at the wheel.
p10040
aVThe jade stripped me, I was sold out, up\u000aagainst it; so I became a thorough bum, in manners, morals, and in\u000adress.
p10041
aVThe boots," he digressed, glancing complacently at his\u000awell-shod feet, "are somewhat out of character, I admit.
p10042
aVOtherwise I\u000aam a bum pure and simple, as you have three times observed, but a bum\u000aof a quality of which you never dreamed, a masterless man reduced to\u000ahis primal elements, three appetites and a sense of humor.
p10043
aVHerr\u000aSofty, beware of me.
p10044
aVI am a dangerous character, I warn you frankly\u000aat the start."
p10045
aVMr. Richard Roe approached the cot once more.
p10046
aV"Speaking of\u000arevolvers," he remarked, "reminds me that I left my own in Batangas,\u000ain care of Uncle Monte de Piedad."
p10047
aVHe drew Schrofft's weapon from\u000abeneath the pillow, and inspected it rapidly.
p10048
aV"A poor thing, but a\u000aColt's," he muttered.
p10049
aV"Calibre 41, of course.
p10050
aVHow European!"
p10051
aVHerr Schrofft, his eyes still closed, groaned weakly.
p10052
aVIt was hard\u000athat his respectable and well-ordered brain should conjure up a\u000anightmare of vagabondage like this, and supply fitting words for the\u000afigure.
p10053
aV"I came southward to Mindoro," the drawling voice went on, "and at\u000athe first stroke I am half a man again.
p10054
aVI have a gun.
p10055
aVHere is a\u000aTin-Roofed House in which to sleep; here is tobacco to smoke; through\u000athe chinks in the floor I perceive sleeping chickens which promise\u000afood.
p10056
aVBest of all, I find here a companion for my solitude.
p10057
aVHerr\u000aSofty, you may need an heir before long.
p10058
aVBehold him here in me."
p10059
aV"_Herr Gott!_" Schrofft groaned again, "I am going crazier every\u000aminute."
p10060
aVSuddenly he opened his eyes, for the door swung on its\u000ahinges and a head surmounted by a shock of coarse black hair was\u000athrust within.
p10061
aVAt the sight of it, all his aggressiveness returned.
p10062
aV"Son of fifty fathers!"
p10063
aVhe screamed.
p10064
aV"Because you think I am dying\u000ayou run away, and now you have the shamelessness to come back!
p10065
aVGo\u000aand be a _muchacho_ for the deffel!
p10066
aVI shall not die; in two days I\u000ashall be strong enough to kill you."
p10067
aV"It was only his canny Filipino way," Mr. Richard Roe broke in,\u000acoming to the rescue of the unfaithful servant.
p10068
aV"He wanted an alibi\u000afor the inquest.
p10069
aVSlave," he announced sternly, "I have saved your\u000alife.
p10070
aVFetch more cigarettes and a bottle of whatever burning water\u000athe market offers.
p10071
aVThen kill three chickens and cook them with\u000aplenty rice--and no grease.
p10072
aVThe Seor Softy and I will have a mucho\u000agrande chow-chow to celebrate my home-coming.
p10073
aVI am his heir.
p10074
aV_Sigue!
p10075
aVPronto!
p10076
aVMadili!_"\u000a\u000aSchrofft glared hopelessly at Mr. Richard Roe.
p10077
aV"Then you are real!"
p10078
aVhe cried.
p10079
aV"That boy, he sees you also, he hears you, he obeys!
p10080
aV_Mein Gott!_  You are a bum.
p10081
aVYou haf no home, you haf no money, you\u000ahaf no grub, you haf no chob.
p10082
aVAnd I would gif a hundert dollars for\u000ajust one man!"
p10083
aV"Alas," said Mr. Richard Roe hollowly, "I am not a man, and the\u000ahundred is unclaimed.
p10084
aVI am the stuff that dreams are made of, bad\u000adreams.
p10085
aVBut I have my better impulses, and I feel them stirring at\u000athe prospect of food.
p10086
aVI will be a ministering angel to you, an airy,\u000afairy, army nurse, pressing my cool hand softly on your fevered\u000abrow."
p10087
aVHe suited the action to the word, save that the hand was hot\u000aand gritty.
p10088
aV"Herr Softy, your pulse is rapid, your temperature is\u000arising, you tremble on the verge of a paroxysm of fever.
p10089
aVWhere is\u000athe quinine?"
p10090
aVThe recurrent hot stage of his disease had indeed seized the patient,\u000aand as it grew upon him he lost more and more his grip of reality\u000aunder the mad contradictions of Mr. Richard Roe's speech and conduct,\u000aand the potent spell of the drug which he administered with a lavish\u000ahand.
p10091
aVDimly, as in a dream, the room stretched wider and higher\u000aabout him, and as the pulse boomed and roared in his ears, he saw in\u000athe distance a phantasm which he knew was called Mr. Richard Roe,\u000asitting at a table and going through the motions of a real man.
p10092
aVIt\u000adrank thirstily from a bottle which a frightened _muchacho_ brought;\u000ait smoked endless cigarettes; it dismembered a steaming chicken with\u000aits fingers, and ate it daintily, ate another, stretched back in its\u000achair and grunted with content.
p10093
aVPhantom or reality, Mr. Richard Roe\u000abegan to be a comfort, he made himself so much at home.
p10094
aVSchrofft\u000aclosed his eyes and dozed.
p10095
aVSuddenly through his slumber cut a well-remembered sound: _Ugh!
p10096
aVKch-chee-e-e-Arghh!
p10097
aVKch-chee-e-e-Ugh!_  He woke to a moment of\u000aclear-headedness and the sense of his predicament.
p10098
aVIt was almost\u000asunset; only eight days were left.
p10099
aV"My trees, my trees!"
p10100
aVhe\u000aquavered, trying weakly to sit up.
p10101
aV"I must go and get them."
p10102
aVInstantly the "cool hand" rested on his forehead and, not unkindly,\u000ahe was shoved back on his pillows.
p10103
aV"You've been dozing," the voice\u000aof Mr. Richard Roe explained soothingly.
p10104
aV"What's the matter?"
p10105
aVBrokenly, still as in a dream, Schrofft heard his own voice go\u000acroaking on, speaking ramblingly of trees, always of trees.
p10106
aVThe\u000aclump of iron-woods that grow at the corner where the mangroves are\u000athickest on the bank, thirty miles up-stream.
p10107
aVThe twelve huge trees\u000athat stand up so high and have their tops pleached together.
p10108
aVThose\u000awere the ones; they must be cut without delay.
p10109
aVHe must start at\u000aonce, because, you see, the _Sarstoon_ would be in on the 18th, and,\u000aif she didn't get the trees, the monsoon would change.
p10110
aVAnd then her\u000avoyage would be wasted, and the customer would not have for six more\u000amonths the wood of unique density which he wanted for non-magnetic\u000agears, and the House would have to bear the blame, when it was all\u000athe fault of a fool named Schrofft, who lay around with fever when\u000athere was work to do.
p10111
aVAt a great distance he saw Mr. Richard Roe sitting with crossed legs,\u000asmoking in long, meditative purr's, and inspecting him narrowly with\u000akeen, unwavering blue eyes.
p10112
aV"You're a rather game little man," said Mr. Richard Roe approvingly.
p10113
aVAfter a long time he spoke again.
p10114
aV"Thirty miles up, you say.
p10115
aVIs\u000athere any one around who knows an iron-wood when he sees one?"
p10116
aVThere was a new, a compelling quality in the voice, which Schrofft\u000ahad not heard before.
p10117
aV"That coward muchacho, that Juan, he knows.
p10118
aVHe has been there with me," said Schrofft.
p10119
aV"And the tools, where are they?"
p10120
aVasked the compelling tones.
p10121
aV"In the canoes, all ready," Schrofft answered obediently.
p10122
aV"I can't understand his getting so excited about a few trees," Mr.\u000aRichard Roe muttered.
p10123
aV"_I_ never could.
p10124
aVBut he's a game little man,\u000aand if he wants his trees as bad as all this, by Jove, he's got to\u000ahave 'em."
p10125
aVHe rose lazily, and stood towering above the cot.
p10126
aV"It's\u000aall right, Schrofft.
p10127
aVGo to sleep.
p10128
aVI'll have your trees here by the\u000aeighteenth."
p10129
aV"You can't," Schrofft objected sleepily, with the unmalicious\u000afrankness of one who states a well-established fact.
p10130
aV"You're nothing\u000abut a bum."
p10131
aV"Go to sleep," Mr. Richard Roe repeated soothingly.
p10132
aV"Perhaps, since\u000athere's so much hurry, I'd better start to-night.
p10133
aVThere's a lovely\u000amoon now, like a Swiss cheese.
p10134
aVLast night it made me think of beer."
p10135
aV"Those trees on the right bank," Schrofft muttered, trying to rise\u000aonce more.
p10136
aVStrong hands pressed him back and held him there.
p10137
aV"Schrofft," Mr.\u000aRichard Roe said slowly and impressively, "pay attention just one\u000aminute, and then you can go to sleep.
p10138
aVWhen I want anything I go and\u000aget it, _sabe_?
p10139
aVSame as I came here and got grub.
p10140
aVSame as I'd go to\u000athe devil for a drink, when I want _that_.
p10141
aVI never happened to want\u000atrees, but I'll get some for you.
p10142
aVNow go to sleep."
p10143
aVUnder the spell of the assuring voice and the comforting grip of the\u000astrong hands on his shoulders, Schrofft's eyelids drooped lower and\u000alower, till even the clatter of energetic feet descending the stairs\u000adid not cause them to flutter.
p10144
aVHe must have dreamed still more then, for strange things happened.
p10145
aVOutside in the village, even in peaceful Bagalayag, a riot rose,\u000avoices of men angry and protesting, voices of women tearful and\u000aimploring, voices of children shrill with excitement, and, dominating\u000aall, a languid, vibrant voice speaking sometimes in English,\u000asometimes in Spanish, sometimes in crude but vigorous Bisayan,\u000athreatening, cajoling, domineering.
p10146
aVGradually all the others died\u000aaway into a murmur of resignation, and then, suddenly, the song of\u000athe saw stopped with a spluttering drawl not unlike the squawk of a\u000afrightened hen.
p10147
aV"Come along, you chaps," said the masterful voice.
p10148
aV"Got a job for you other place, _sabe_?"
p10149
aVThe response slid in falsetto semitones from a Mongolian tongue.
p10150
aV"Got plenty worl-luk this side," it said sullenly.
p10151
aV"No can do."
p10152
aV"Sure can do," said the master.
p10153
aV"Got to do, _sabe_?
p10154
aVCome along, you\u000abeggars, before I tie your pigtails together."
p10155
aVThen gradually all the tumult ceased, and restful quiet enveloped the\u000aTin-Roofed House and endured so long that Schrofft craftily opened\u000ahis eyes a crack, and gazed about his chamber.
p10156
aVIt was quite empty.
p10157
aVThe heavy lids drooped once more, and he fell into a deep, untroubled\u000asleep.
p10158
aVAnd as he slept, the cooling sweat bathed his worn body.
p10159
aVTogether, the quinine and the excitement of the day had conquered his\u000adisease; the fever was broken.
p10160
aVThe first impression borne in on Schrofft's consciousness when he\u000awoke next morning, sufficiently clear in mind, but weak beyond belief\u000ain body, was that Bagalayag was uncommonly quiet, even for Bagalayag.
p10161
aVThe droning saw was silent; there was no rustle of bare feet on the\u000agrassy ways, no low murmur of gossip from sleepy tongues, no\u000astraw-muffled booming of rice mortars, no whine of carabao or shriek\u000aof wooden axle-boxes as the tuba was brought in from the palm-grove.
p10162
aVFor a moment he lay with an empty mind.
p10163
aVThen Memory returned.
p10164
aV"_Himmel!_" he muttered.
p10165
aV"I did not dream it _all_!"
p10166
aVAt the sound, a doddering old man rose from the corner and approached\u000athe cot.
p10167
aV"Does the seor want anything?"
p10168
aVhe asked.
p10169
aV"Where is everybody?"
p10170
aVSchrofft demanded.
p10171
aV"Where is Juan?"
p10172
aV"They are all gone," the old man replied.
p10173
aV"Only I am left behind.
p10174
aVThe Seor Duque took them all."
p10175
aV"The Seor Duque took them all!"
p10176
aVSchrofft echoed.
p10177
aVDukes are rare in\u000aMindoro.
p10178
aV"Si, se-o-or.
p10179
aVEl Duque de la Calle Milochentaitres in America.
p10180
aVHe\u000atook them all, the men, the boys, the Chinese pigs who saw; all\u000aBagalayag but me--because I am very old.
p10181
aVOnly I am left, and the\u000awomen and children who hide in the houses to pray.
p10182
aVThey go to cut\u000adown trees, all the trees in Mindoro, I think.
p10183
aVIt is an order from\u000aOuashingtone.
p10184
aVThe Seor Duque says so."
p10185
aVThe Duke of 1083rd Street in America!
p10186
aVDecidedly, if Schrofft had\u000abeen delirious, all Bagalayag now outdid him in delusion.
p10187
aV"Does the seor want anything?"
p10188
aVthe old man repeated.
p10189
aV"If we had\u000aguessed that the seor had el Duque de la Calle Milochentaitres for a\u000afriend, we would not have left him alone to be sick.
p10190
aVIt was very\u000awicked, but the Duque says he will forgive us if we get the trees."
p10191
aVAt the mention of trees, Schrofft's lips had contracted.
p10192
aVBut his\u000amind, as unstrung as his body, was at the mercy of every emotional\u000acatspaw that ruffled it, and the childlike awe and faith in the voice\u000aof the old man brought a long-forgotten sensation clutching at his\u000adiaphragm.
p10193
aV"We have been very wicked; but the Duke says he will\u000aforgive us if we get the trees."
p10194
aVFor all his weakness, Schrofft\u000achuckled a little at the audacity of it.
p10195
aVAn unwonted feeling of\u000adependence took hold of the self-reliant little man.
p10196
aVHe combated it\u000afeebly.
p10197
aV"He cannot do it; he is only a bum," Reason urged.
p10198
aVBut the\u000aprotest of Reason was purely formal, and triumphant Cheerfulness\u000aretorted, "He can do anything--when he wishes to."
p10199
aV"What would the seor like for breakfast?"
p10200
aVthe old man's voice broke\u000ain.
p10201
aV"He may have six little oysters, or two eggs passed through\u000awater, or a cup of milk with one egg in it, or a very small fish not\u000afried--the Duque says to fry is not good for sick ones--but cooked on\u000aa sharp stick, as He Himself taught me."
p10202
aVOnce more Schrofft relaxed in the new and comfortable sense of utter\u000adependence.
p10203
aV"Oysters," he murmured unctuously, and gave himself up\u000ato the anticipation of the plump, brassy-flavored morsels which were\u000asoon to cool his throat.
p10204
aV_Deus ex Machina!_  A God from the Machine\u000aof Things had taken his affairs in hand.
p10205
aVAs the days wore on, the words became more than a mere phrase.
p10206
aVIn\u000athe long, lazy, roseate hours which a convalescent knows, Schrofft\u000athought much, and the well-timed arrival of the mysterious Mr.\u000aRichard Roe at the crisis of his illness and his fortunes, the\u000aunbelievable eccentricity of the man, the nonchalant confidence with\u000awhich he had undertaken a task in which he had no part either by\u000ainterest or training, all combined to rouse in Schrofft's mind that\u000asuperstition which is so fundamental an element in all us Aryans.
p10207
aVThe manifestation took the guise of Hero-Worship.
p10208
aVAn unreasoning\u000afaith in Mr. Richard Roe got hold of him.
p10209
aVThe atmosphere in which he lived strengthened the conviction.
p10210
aVMr.\u000aRoe was absent only in the body; the power of his masterful\u000apersonality still moulded life and thought in Bagalayag.
p10211
aVThe\u000ablear-eyed, tottering attendant he had left for Schrofft, anxious,\u000afussy, mentally helpless, had one warrant for all his load of\u000atroublesome attentions: "The Seor Duque told me to do it."
p10212
aVAs Schrofft grew stronger, and strolled out into the village, he\u000afound its people under the same spell.
p10213
aVWomen and children had\u000agradually stolen out from the shacks; one by one they took up their\u000adaily occupation; the patter of their anxious prayers was no longer\u000aone of the street-sounds of Bagalayag; they asked Schrofft\u000atrustingly, "When will the Duque bring our husbands back?"
p10214
aVAnd Schrofft answered just as trustingly, "On the eighteenth."
p10215
aVDimly he felt the thrill of the contrast, saw primeval Nature and the\u000alean, sardonic American face each other, and felt no doubt of the\u000aoutcome.
p10216
aVMany times, as the slow days passed, he looked away to the\u000ablack mantle of forest which clothed all the land to the south,\u000aclose-fitting and unbroken up to the rough crest of Mount Bagalayag\u000aitself.
p10217
aV"He'll do it," he repeated continually.
p10218
aVAnd Mr. Richard Roe did do it.
p10219
aVOn the evening of the seventeenth, a\u000ashrill clamor of women's voices ran through the town, and their\u000aowners gathered on the river bank to meet an unwieldy raft that was\u000awarping in on the brown and sluggish current.
p10220
aVThe huge sullen logs\u000aseemed bound to sink, in spite of the bulk of chambered bamboo which\u000abuoyed them, but standing springily erect on their backs, Mr. Richard\u000aRoe dominated the raft as he did all things else.
p10221
aVWhen it grounded,\u000ahe swung himself to the shoulders of two of his men and was borne\u000atriumphantly ashore.
p10222
aV"By Jove, Schrofft," was his greeting, "glad to see you looking that\u000away."
p10223
aVHe flipped a hand behind him, and added casually, "There are\u000ayour trees," and that was all of the little epic of the forest which\u000aSchrofft ever heard from his lips, except for fragments which he\u000atossed out to laugh at.
p10224
aVBut from the tales which the restored\u000ahusbands and fathers of Bagalayag chattered to their families, he\u000agathered a picture of heart-breaking toil and endurance, and\u000acheerful, laughing resourcefulness which filled him with a yearning\u000aadmiration for its central figure.
p10225
aVThat night, had Mr. Richard Roe so chosen, he might have become\u000ahereditary lord of Bagalayag in Mindoro, and laughed at the law, the\u000aConstitution and the flag, schoolhouses, benevolent assimilation, and\u000ahuman progress.
p10226
aVLike a travel-worn, unshaven monarch, he sat in\u000aSchrofft's long cane chair, puffing contentedly at Schrofft's\u000acherished china pipe, while the unfaithful servant Juan knelt at his\u000afeet and revived the tarnished glories of the shining boots, and his\u000aprimitive worshippers poured in a stream of tribute, herbs of the\u000afield and fruits, fish and flesh and fowl, indigestible sweets and\u000adeath-dealing drinks of home manufacture.
p10227
aVOn all alike he smiled\u000akindly yet wearily, with the affable condescension of one who by\u000adivine right might be severe, yet chooses to be kind.
p10228
aVBut once his\u000asmile broadened into feeling.
p10229
aV"You won't find Lame Duck and Gouty Hen bringing me any thanks for\u000astringing 'em that way," he remarked to Schrofft, who sat in the\u000abackground, as proud as the mother of one chicken.
p10230
aV"Lame Duck and Gouty Hen?"
p10231
aVSchrofft echoed, puzzled.
p10232
aV"My untamed Chinks," the Duke of 1083rd Street explained.
p10233
aV"That was\u000aa stroke of genius, taking them.
p10234
aVThey did the work, while the\u000aFilipinos did the kicking.
p10235
aVWe sawed the trees down, you know--may\u000anot be the way to do it, but we _did_ it--and we three took turns--"\u000a\u000a"Lame Duck and Gouty Hen!"
p10236
aVSchrofft spluttered with delight.
p10237
aV"_Himmel!_  Such names!"
p10238
aVThen he became serious.
p10239
aV"How can I pay\u000ayou!
p10240
aVWhen you come I say to you, 'I would gif a hundert dollars for\u000aa man,' and you _are_ a man, the finest I efer--"\u000a\u000a"That's all right," said Mr. Richard Roe benevolently.
p10241
aV"It was good\u000asport.
p10242
aVI wouldn't work that hard for money."
p10243
aV"Of course there's the--the other side too--"  Schrofft stumbled over\u000ahis words, bashful as a maiden with her lover.
p10244
aV"I cannot thank you.
p10245
aVYou save my life, you save my reputation, you--"\u000a\u000a"Cut out the thanks, Schrofft," Mr. Roe interrupted, with a touch of\u000asmiling haughtiness.
p10246
aV"I don't like 'em.
p10247
aVYou'd better be clearing\u000aout now," the weary monarch added to his thronging admirers.
p10248
aV"You're\u000anice little brown men enough, but I'm sleepy.
p10249
aV_Sigue Dagupan_, the\u000awhole bunch."
p10250
aVTwo mornings later, after breakfast, Herr Schrofft again brought up\u000athe subject of Mr. Richard Roe's reward.
p10251
aVIn the intervening day the\u000a_Sarstoon_ had come and gone with her hard-won load, and Schrofft's\u000aadmiration for his miraculous helper had grown exceedingly.
p10252
aVWith the\u000apassion for work still on him, Mr. Richard Roe had been everywhere,\u000aand everywhere had been effective, on the beach, in the canoes, on\u000athe _Sarstoon's_ deck and in her hold, even on her bridge.
p10253
aVMingled with the boundless admiration, was another feeling which\u000afilled Schrofft with confusion, while it opened a vista to the\u000asky-line of his lonely life.
p10254
aVSince young Erich Schmidt was killed\u000abefore his eyes, twenty years gone in Africa, he had wanted no\u000afriend, no bunkie, _kein Kamerad._  But now--Mr. Richard Roe sat\u000aacross his table irresistibly reminiscent of some wandering, _rou_\u000agod, who needed but a whiff of Olympian air to refreshen his eternal\u000ayouth.
p10255
aVSun and wind and work had erased the signs of dissipated\u000astrength, sleep had rubbed out the aging lines of work, and now he\u000asat in the _sala_ of the Tin-Roofed House lean, brown, and hard, with\u000ahis rumpled yellow hair and trace of yellow beard, and sparkling eyes\u000ahalf smiling at Life and Fate--not defiantly or deprecatingly, but\u000awith the faint amusement one may find in the vagaries of equals one\u000aknows well.
p10256
aVMingled emotions made expression difficult for Schrofft, and he gave\u000aspeech its most practical form.
p10257
aV"Here is the hundert," he said\u000agruffly, and pushed a chunky little bag across.
p10258
aV"It don't pay you,\u000anothin' efer can--"\u000a\u000a"The hundred?"
p10259
aVMr. Richard Roe stared at the bag as if surprised,\u000abut he drew it to him.
p10260
aV"Oh, yes.
p10261
aVI'll take it if you like,\u000aSchrofft, of course.
p10262
aVMuch obliged."
p10263
aVAs he weighed it in his hand,\u000ahis eyes darkened suddenly, and the under lids drew tight, as if he\u000awere gazing at something far away over the blue water which lay\u000abefore him.
p10264
aVAlmost unconsciously he untied the cord that bound it,\u000aand a little stream of gold ran chinking out.
p10265
aV"Yellow ones," Mr. Roe\u000amuttered.
p10266
aV"It's not much," Schrofft said apologetically, "but--  What are you\u000agoing to do now?"
p10267
aVStill unconsciously, Mr. Roe's long supple fingers had arranged the\u000aheap into four little orderly piles, and he was shoving them back and\u000aforth, like counters in some game.
p10268
aV"Four stacks of blue ones," he\u000amuttered.
p10269
aV"What will you do now?"
p10270
aVSchrofft repeated.
p10271
aV"Eh?"
p10272
aVsaid Mr. Richard Roe.
p10273
aV"Oh, yes.
p10274
aVWhat'll I do?
p10275
aVWell,\u000aSchrofft, I never bother to plan that out far ahead."
p10276
aV"I'll tell you," said Schrofft, gathering head for a flood of speech,\u000a"you stay with me.
p10277
aVI--I called you a bum once.
p10278
aVI take it back.
p10279
aVYou're all right.
p10280
aVThe quickness to decide, the way to make\u000aeverything do what you want, the good luck, you have it all!"
p10281
aV"If I _did_ have luck," Mr. Roe muttered thoughtfully, "that'd be\u000aenough to clean out Rafferty's bank.
p10282
aVBy Jove, I'll do it.
p10283
aVI'll play\u000athe twelve."
p10284
aV"You come with me," Schrofft urged.
p10285
aV"You are young, you have had\u000ayour fling; now it's time to settle down.
p10286
aVI'll help you, I'll\u000abe--what-you-call?--the balance w'eel.
p10287
aVI teach you all I know, and\u000ain two three year you'll be the boss of us all.
p10288
aVYou'll have a chob\u000abetter'n mine."
p10289
aVHe hesitated, for Mr. Roe was gazing at him with a whimsical smile.
p10290
aV"Go ahead, Schrofft," he said.
p10291
aV"What kind of a job _is_ yours?
p10292
aVWhat\u000ado you get out of it?"
p10293
aV"Ten thousand mark a year, und expenses," said Schrofft, uneasy for\u000asome mockery to come.
p10294
aV"Ten thousand marks!
p10295
aVThat's twenty-five hundred dollars," Mr. Roe\u000acommented.
p10296
aV"_And_ expenses.
p10297
aVThat's a lot of money, Schrofft.
p10298
aVBut I\u000alive simply; my expenses wouldn't be high enough to make it pay.
p10299
aVSo\u000aI'll just go back to Batangas and play the twelve.
p10300
aVTwelve trees, you\u000aknow."
p10301
aVDesperately, imploringly, Schrofft argued with him, dangled larger\u000aand juicier bait before his eyes.
p10302
aV"You might be a partner in the\u000aHouse!"
p10303
aVhe cried.
p10304
aVBut Mr. Roe remained unmoved, even at that\u000adazzling prospect, and at last Schrofft lost his temper.
p10305
aV"You are a bum," he shouted angrily.
p10306
aV"It's chust what I say before.
p10307
aVYou haf no home, no food, no chob, no money, and--" he finished\u000ahelplessly, "_Mein Gott!_  You do not care!"
p10308
aV"Money could not buy the glorious uncertainty I enjoy," Mr. Roe\u000areplied pleasantly.
p10309
aV"Calm down, Schrofft.
p10310
aVI'm going out to tell 'em\u000ato get a canoe ready for me."
p10311
aVLate that afternoon he left, with his tattered clothing and his\u000ashining boots and his little bag of gold, and his smile, which he\u000ashed benignantly on the worshippers who thronged the beach.
p10312
aVOnly\u000athree residents of all Bagalayag were missing.
p10313
aVDown the street Lame\u000aDuck and Gouty Hen stolidly made up lost time--_Ugh!
p10314
aVKch-chee-e-e-Arghh!
p10315
aVKch-chee-e-e-Ugh!_ And up in the _sala_ of the\u000aTin-Roofed House a shaggy little man, his back resolutely turned to\u000athe window and the leave-taking, puffed savagely at a big china pipe,\u000aand exploded every now and then: "Chust a bum!
p10316
aVA good-for-nothin'\u000abum!"
p10317
aVBut when the sun was gone and all the shadows on the mountain\u000ahad thickened into one, he laid down the pipe and went to the window\u000aand gazed out long over the darkening sea.
p10318
aV"My poor little bum god\u000afrom the machine," he said wistfully.
p10319
aV"Now I must forget him."
p10320
aVIt was not so easy to forget Mr. Richard Roe.
p10321
aVThe memory of him\u000aclung to Schrofft even after his work was done in Mindoro, and he had\u000abidden Bagalayag an everlasting farewell.
p10322
aVIn Manila, Mr. Richard\u000aRoe's image dogged his busy footsteps, and when at last he climbed\u000athe side of the _Rosetta Maru_, bound for Hongkong and home, Mr. Roe\u000awas at the surface of his thoughts.
p10323
aV"_Mein Gott!_" Schrofft mused,\u000aas he leaned on the rail that first night out and saw Bolinao looming\u000afaintly in the gulf of blackness, far to leeward, "he saved my life,\u000aand now I leave him in the Philippines."
p10324
aVHe leaned there, absorbed in a vision of the companionship which\u000acould never be, till the last shadow of the islands had faded in the\u000anight.
p10325
aVThen brusquely, as if he awakened himself, he turned forward\u000ato the smoking-room and the nightcap of rum and lime-juice which was\u000ahis concession to the luxury of rest.
p10326
aV"My poor little bum god," he\u000amuttered, "if he was here, I'd buy him a drink.
p10327
aVHe's had too many\u000adrinks already, though, poor deffel."
p10328
aVAt the door of the smoking-room he stopped abruptly.
p10329
aV"Butterflies,"\u000ahe grunted in disgust, and turned aside to a settee which stood near\u000ain the shadow, to wait for his drink till they were done.
p10330
aVAnd then,\u000asuddenly, he leaned forward and gazed into the brightly lighted room,\u000afor a voice there had set all his nerves aquiver.
p10331
aV"_So?_" he\u000amuttered incredulously.
p10332
aV"_Kann nicht sein!_"\u000a\u000aInside the room three men were sitting at a little table with a\u000abottle between them, all dressed alike in spotless and unrumpled\u000alinen.
p10333
aVTheir likeness ended with their dress.
p10334
aVOne was a boy, the\u000adown still soft on his chin, but his cheeks were pasty and he had the\u000adead eyes of an evil old man.
p10335
aVThe second was a flabby man of middle\u000aage, whose red face was an expressionless mask, from behind which he\u000alooked out watchfully.
p10336
aVAnd the third, brilliant, flashing, shedding\u000aa glow of life and strength around him, was Mr. Richard Roe in a new\u000aguise.
p10337
aV"How'd you clean up over here this time, Billy?"
p10338
aVasked the boy in a\u000adry, professional tone.
p10339
aV"Well enough," Mr. Richard Roe answered.
p10340
aV"Went on my uppers once,\u000adown in Mindoro."
p10341
aV"I travel on 'em all the time," said the wan youth.
p10342
aV"Never saw such\u000aluck as I have."
p10343
aV"Get a mascot, Mike," Mr. Richard Roe advised mockingly.
p10344
aV"That's\u000awhat I did.
p10345
aVFinest little mannikin of a mascot the Luck Machine ever\u000aground out.
p10346
aVFound a little Dutchman down there--down on his luck,\u000asick, almost crying for some trees he'd got to cut or lose his job or\u000ahis reputation or something.
p10347
aVI got 'em for him.
p10348
aVThe little beggar\u000awas so glad he gave me a hundred, and I played it on the twelve at\u000aRafferty's--there were twelve trees--and the twelve came.
p10349
aVThey\u000awouldn't let me bet again, so I came up to Manila."
p10350
aV"Hell," said the aged young man apathetically, "what's thirty-six\u000ahundred?
p10351
aVI could cash up that myself."
p10352
aV"And," said the other man, speaking through motionless lips, "the\u000alucky devil struck Manila just when that tin-horn Haines had sold a\u000amine down Mindanao way.
p10353
aVHaines got to working his bellows out to the\u000aCountry Club, wanting to back the wheel, no limit, and Billy took him\u000aup and played the twelve, and the twelve came up--twice running.
p10354
aVThat's all."
p10355
aVThe aged young man stared at Mr. Richard Roe with dropped jaw.
p10356
aV"Good\u000aLord!"
p10357
aV--his voice was an awe-struck whisper--"that's over a million!"
p10358
aV"Considerably over, theoretically," Mr. Richard Roe agreed, smiling\u000acoolly at the disconcerted young man.
p10359
aV"Unfortunately, Mr. Haines\u000acouldn't cash it all, so I took his notes for everything but a goodly\u000anumber of thou's.
p10360
aVYou may have the notes if you'd like 'em, Mike.
p10361
aVI've got all I want.
p10362
aVAnd get a mascot."
p10363
aVThe aged young man went off into a stream of oaths.
p10364
aV"Where are you\u000agoin' now, Billy?"
p10365
aVhe asked at last.
p10366
aV"Goin'--home?"
p10367
aVHis voice\u000adropped as he spoke the tabooed word, and for a moment, through the\u000alines with which greed and cunning and indulgence had marked him, the\u000aface of a wistful, heart-sick youngster came out dimly.
p10368
aV"_And_ a wife, _and_ a baby?"
p10369
aVsaid Mr. Roe, smiling whimsically.
p10370
aV"No, thank you, Mike.
p10371
aVI'm going over to Siam and buy a small\u000atin-mine.
p10372
aVIt's a thing I've always wanted.
p10373
aVI may breed a line of\u000awhite elephants on the side."
p10374
aVAbruptly, as if a sudden thought had\u000acome to him, he rose and filled the glasses, emptying the bottle.
p10375
aV"Gentlemen," he cried, holding his glass aloft, "I ask for bottoms\u000aup.
p10376
aVTo the Seor Ess-soffti, the prince of mascots.
p10377
aVMay he live\u000along and die busy."
p10378
aVThe glasses clinked and were emptied.
p10379
aVMr. Roe\u000aset his on the table.
p10380
aV"Good night, gentlemen," he said, and departed.
p10381
aVBut his progress was soon interrupted.
p10382
aVBlinded by the sudden\u000adarkness of the deck, he lost his way, and was nearly sent sprawling\u000aby the legs of a man who sat huddled on a settee, a shabby little\u000aman, even in the dark.
p10383
aV"What the devil," Mr. Roe began, with lofty\u000adispleasure.
p10384
aVHe checked himself.
p10385
aV"I beg your pardon, I'm sure," he\u000asaid with the elaborate courtesy of one who, having the divine right\u000ato be insolent, yet chooses to be kind.
p10386
aVShrinking as at a blow, the shabby little man drew in his legs.
p10387
aVEven\u000ain the gloom the movement had an appealing humbleness about it that\u000awent to the ready sympathy of Mr. Richard Roe.
p10388
aV"It's all right, old\u000achap," he said.
p10389
aV"No harm done.
p10390
aVGood night."
p10391
aVThe shabby little man mumbled something inarticulate, and Mr. Roe,\u000aimmaculate, self-sufficient, free from care, strode on and left his\u000amascot staring blindly out at the dim, jumbled waters flashing by.
p10392
aV"What luck!"
p10393
aVthe mascot mumbled to the waters, after a long time.
p10394
aVAnd then again, "What luck!"
p10395
aVCHAPTER XI\u000a\u000aMCGENNIS'S PROMOTION\u000a\u000aMy third adventurer was of still another type, a young man, a boy, if\u000ayou like, who was fresh and unsullied in body and mind and heart,\u000awith life all before him.
p10396
aVThe opponents he fought with were all\u000ainside himself, and of the worth of what he won you shall judge for\u000ayourselves.
p10397
aVWithin a minute or two of six o'clock that morning the sun rose, and\u000ait was broad, staring day.
p10398
aVOne instant the world was smothered in a\u000adamp, impenetrable, almost tangible grayness; the next, its nakedness\u000alay discovered in a glare of light.
p10399
aVThere was a sea of limpid lukewarm water heaving slowly; a ribbon of\u000abeach, metallic-white; a tangle of untended, unproductive vegetation;\u000aa village equally untended and unproductive, except of unnecessary\u000ababies, where listless brown people moved without much purpose, or,\u000alacking the ambition even to make a show of activity, lolled where\u000athey were.
p10400
aVThe tropical sun had no magic of half-lights to tinge it all with\u000aromance or stir it into fugitive beauty.
p10401
aVSuch as Sicaba was at\u000aheart, it stood revealed.
p10402
aVWhen the sun rose, John McGennis rose too, and stood for a moment,\u000aunshivering in the lukewarm air, to look down on the poverty of his\u000atown, before he turned to pour water over himself out of an old\u000atomato-can.
p10403
aVLike the morning and the sea and the air, the water had no tang in\u000ait, and McGennis, drying himself slowly and methodically, felt no\u000afresher for his bath.
p10404
aVWhen a youthful and well-tempered body fails\u000ato respond to the caress of sluicing water, there is generally\u000asomething wrong with the mind which inhabits it.
p10405
aVThere was with the\u000amind of McGennis.
p10406
aVThe trouble lay outside his window.
p10407
aVThat compound of staring sky and\u000asea and stared-at village which the day revealed had overwhelmed him.
p10408
aVAs mere geological and botanical facts, Sicaba, Pagros, the Tropics,\u000ahad proved too big for him.
p10409
aVThey made of him just a spot of life,\u000ameaningless as an ant toiling unendingly in the forest of the\u000agrass-stems.
p10410
aVTiny dot of intelligence that he found himself, in the\u000amidst of those triumphant physical forces, McGennis had come to\u000awonder whether anything he could do among them mattered much.
p10411
aVSlowly and methodically, as he had bathed, he dressed--right sock,\u000aleft sock, right shoe, left shoe, right puttee, left puttee, put the\u000astrap twice round, haul it through the buckle and tuck the end back\u000aneatly--and when he was trim in his khaki and yellow leather he stood\u000afor a moment with the irresolution of inertia on him.
p10412
aVThen he pulled\u000ahis knife from his pocket, strode across to the thick corner-post of\u000ahis room, stooped, and with elaborate care cut a notch in the tough,\u000adense wood.
p10413
aVThe post, from the upward limit of his reach to well down toward his\u000aknees, was jagged with such notches lying in groups of seven, six\u000aside by side, and another cut diagonally across them.
p10414
aVThey were a\u000acalendar of more than ordinary significance, in the mind of its\u000amaker.
p10415
aVEach of them represented a day of "Grin, gabble, gobble,"\u000aeach checked off twenty-four hours in which he had stuck by his\u000atraditions, greeting every comer with that contortion of the lips\u000awhich, conventionally at least, expresses pleasure, eating sufficient\u000afood to keep his body in repair--McGennis reverenced his body\u000aunthinkingly as an ancient Greek--and in which he had, both in his\u000aoffice and in the primitive society of Sicaba, "waggled his jaw," and\u000athereby overcome a growing disposition to speechlessness.
p10416
aVWith the fierce enthusiasm of an ascetic, he cut these records,\u000aineffaceably deep, on the mornings of the days for which they stood.
p10417
aVThus there could be no going back.
p10418
aVStaring at him from the\u000aundecaying wood, they warned him that for one more stretch, at least,\u000ahe must grin, gobble, and gabble, or be a quitter.
p10419
aVThey served a more immediately practical purpose also.
p10420
aVMcGennis had\u000afound that it was the first grimace, the first nibble at the food his\u000aOccidental stomach loathed, the first burst of inane chatter, which\u000acame hard.
p10421
aVOnce fairly started, the grin became a veritable\u000asmile--how boyish and appealing he had never guessed--the chatter\u000abecame animated question and answer, and his stomach, more\u000afundamentally human than Occidental, found even the food Sicaba\u000aafforded preferable to emptiness.
p10422
aVBut somehow the quiet of the\u000aevenings and the stillness of the long nights and the flatness of the\u000adawns brought back continually the question: "What's the use?"
p10423
aVand he\u000awould have his fight to make all over, with his notch.
p10424
aVOn this particular morning, he stood for a while staring at the\u000ajagged post which was at once a cenotaph to his departed days and an\u000aaltar prepared for the sacrifice of days to come.
p10425
aVWithout counting,\u000aMcGennis knew that his latest notch rounded out a tale of three\u000ahundred and sixty-five.
p10426
aVThe possibilities of that one post were not\u000aexhausted yet, and his house held a dozen other posts, virgin still,\u000aand smooth.
p10427
aVAnd even if he should endure to notch all the posts in\u000aall the houses of Sicaba and all the fringing palms along the beach,\u000aand all the trees in the primeval forest round about, it would result\u000ain--what?
p10428
aVMcGennis had met a man once, down in Bacolot, who made a practice of\u000agetting as drunk as possible once each month, once and no more.
p10429
aVIt\u000agave one something definite to look forward and back to, and hope for\u000aand regret, he had explained without embarrassment, and that was an\u000aachievement for a white man in the tropics.
p10430
aVMcGennis, staring glumly\u000aat the record of his featureless year, felt that perhaps that man was\u000aas reasonable as any other.
p10431
aVThen, impulsively, he stooped again and the knife-blade flashed with\u000amimic fierceness as he hacked at his post.
p10432
aVWhen he rose there were\u000afourteen new notches in it.
p10433
aVHe had mortgaged a fortnight of his new\u000ayear.
p10434
aVThere was no sense in it, very likely, but it was done, and\u000airrevocable, and therefore comforting in a way.
p10435
aVHe stood back, and\u000athe first smile of the day curled his lips.
p10436
aVThe fool part of him\u000aamused the rest, and he turned to the _sala_ and breakfast with some\u000acheerfulness.
p10437
aVHe was making his last few conscientious pecks at that meal, when the\u000aMunicipal Secretary, exalted and short-winded personage, climbed his\u000astairs puffingly and stood blinking in the door.
p10438
aVMcGennis set his\u000acup down and uttered the sound which trustful Sicaba interpreted as\u000athe outburst of uncontrollable joy.
p10439
aV"Well, Secretario!"
p10440
aVhe cried, in his atrocious and unfaltering\u000aSpanish.
p10441
aV"You're just in time for chocolate.
p10442
aVMilicio!"
p10443
aVhe shouted\u000ato his cook.
p10444
aVThe Secretary raised a pudgy hand in deprecation, the dignity of an\u000aofficial mission being on him.
p10445
aV"It iss dhe lattair, Mr. Magheenis,"\u000ahe announced, holding out a crumpled official envelope.
p10446
aV"Dhe\u000aSupervisor Provincial sends it wiv a man to running."
p10447
aVSmiling the contented smile of a fat man whose exertion is over, the\u000aSecretary sank into a chair and fanned himself with his hat.
p10448
aV"_Sena\u000amuy importante_," he explained more familiarly.
p10449
aV"The courier cost\u000atwo _pesos_.
p10450
aVI brought it over at once."
p10451
aV"A letter by courier and two _pesos_!"
p10452
aVMcGennis cried, knowing that\u000asurprise was expected.
p10453
aV"We're getting up in the world.
p10454
aVExcuse me if\u000aI read it, Secretario?"
p10455
aV"With pleasure," the Secretary murmured, but McGennis did not hear\u000ahim.
p10456
aVHe heard nothing, saw nothing, but those surprising words in\u000athe crabbed writing of his chief, which changed life in a flash and\u000asettled that tormenting question once for all.
p10457
aVTwice he read the letter through greedily, before he dropped it to\u000astare out through the open window.
p10458
aVA kaleidoscopic change had\u000aovertaken Botany and Geology.
p10459
aVThe corner of the weedy _plaza_ on\u000awhich his house fronted now lay fresh and clean under the early\u000asunshine and the salty breeze.
p10460
aVBeyond it rose a grove of\u000acocoa-palms, with brown-thatched houses nestled in their shade, and\u000abetween the tall columns of the tree-trunks shot the crisp sparkle of\u000athe blue Visayan Sea.
p10461
aVAll at once, even Sicaba was exuberant with\u000alife, youthful in beauty, friendly.
p10462
aVHalf noting the change, McGennis\u000araced along beside his thronging thoughts.
p10463
aVWhat the chief said was true.
p10464
aVHe _had_ thought he was forgotten and\u000astranded in Sicaba.
p10465
aVHastily his mind swept back over the dragging\u000ayear he was just finishing.
p10466
aVAgain he saw himself an enthusiastic\u000apilgrim with a work to do.
p10467
aVAgain he went through the disenchantment;\u000afelt the vastness and wildness of the Islands, triumphant Geology and\u000aBotany, burst upon him, reminding him for the first time that even an\u000aEngineer is only a man at bottom.
p10468
aVAnd once again he felt his\u000adisappointment in the people, the simple, childlike, obstinately\u000apliant folk who listened so interestedly, and opposed the inertia of\u000adead centuries to every improvement.
p10469
aVHow was one to teach them\u000aanything?
p10470
aVAnd why should a deputy provincial supervisor, placed in\u000acharge of the roads and bridges and harbors of the whole North Coast,\u000awith headquarters at Sicaba, try to create roads and harbors and\u000abridges to supervise?
p10471
aVThat had become the question finally.
p10472
aVBut he had kept on trying, and now a year was up and he had\u000aaccomplished something, even in hopeless Sicaba.
p10473
aVThe town was a\u000alittle cleaner for his having lived there.
p10474
aVA few people had come to\u000atrust "America."
p10475
aVAnd there _were_ roads and bridges and harbors, on\u000athe blue-prints in his office.
p10476
aVPerhaps it had paid after all.
p10477
aVAt\u000aany rate the people liked him, and he liked them.
p10478
aVThe fat old\u000aSecretario, now--\u000a\u000aJust then that patient man interrupted him with the most suppressed\u000aof coughs.
p10479
aV"Well, Secretario," said McGennis, rousing, "let's drink\u000aour chocolate.
p10480
aVI must have been dreaming.
p10481
aVI hope I haven't kept you\u000awaiting long?"
p10482
aV"Only a moment," the visitor assured him, though the Deputy\u000aSupervisor's day-dream had lasted long for any dream, "only a moment.
p10483
aVI hope," he added, curiosity struggling with courtesy, "that I did\u000anot bring bad news."
p10484
aV"Bad news!"
p10485
aVMcGennis beamed on him.
p10486
aV"You brought the best little\u000aold news _you'll_ ever tote.
p10487
aVSecretario, if you never promulgate\u000aworse news than that, you'll boost your circulation a thousand a day.
p10488
aVIt was red news with green edges."
p10489
aVThe Secretary could understand the tone, if the words were beyond\u000ahim, and his smile matched McGennis's own.
p10490
aV"I could almost believe,"\u000ahe hinted with elephantine archness, "that the Government has\u000aincreased your salary."
p10491
aV"Secretario," said McGennis approvingly, "you hit the truth in the\u000aeye that time.
p10492
aVBut that isn't the best of it."
p10493
aV"Ah," said the Secretary promptly, "then you are also to be married."
p10494
aV"Not on your life!"
p10495
aVMcGennis shouted scornfully.
p10496
aV"Not on your life,\u000aSecretario.
p10497
aVThey've raised me."
p10498
aV"Raised you," the Secretary murmured uncomprehendingly.
p10499
aVMost of\u000aMcGennis's conversation was half incomprehensible to him, and all the\u000amore entertaining just for that.
p10500
aVIt brought him into touch with\u000awords he had never heard of.
p10501
aV"Sure," McGennis repeated.
p10502
aV"Raised me.
p10503
aVShoved me up a peg.
p10504
aVPromoted me."
p10505
aV"Ah, promoted!"
p10506
aVsaid the Secretary, catching at the flying tails of a\u000aword he knew.
p10507
aV"In the eye again," McGennis applauded.
p10508
aV"Secretario," he began\u000aimpressively, smoothing out the crumpled letter, "the Old Man,"--so\u000ahe spoke of his chief, the engineer in charge of the battle with\u000aBotany and Geology in the two great provinces of _Pagros Oriental y\u000aOccidental_--"the Old Man has had his eye on me, so he says.
p10509
aVAnd I\u000areckon he means it.
p10510
aVYes, sir, the old telescope has had a sight on\u000ayours respectfully clear up here in Sicaba."
p10511
aV"Yes?"
p10512
aVmurmured the Secretary, heroically sipping his detestable,\u000alukewarm chocolate.
p10513
aV"And he says," McGennis quoted freely, "that I haven't made good so\u000aworse, and that having watered and weeded the banana tree I shall now\u000aopen my mouth and let something drop therein.
p10514
aVAnd what, Secretario,"\u000aMcGennis demanded excitedly, "_what_ do you suppose is going to drop?"
p10515
aV"Yes," the Secretary agreed placidly, "I comprehend.
p10516
aVIt is a very\u000agood idea."
p10517
aV"You bet it is," McGennis shouted.
p10518
aV"But you don't comprehend enough\u000ato notice.
p10519
aVLook here, Secretario.
p10520
aVYou know they're building a road\u000aup in the Igorrote country, and the Igarooters won't work, and\u000athey're going to put me in charge of the worst section of it and see\u000aif I can make 'em work.
p10521
aVWill I _make_ them?"
p10522
aVhe demanded,\u000arhetorically.
p10523
aV"_Will_ I?
p10524
aVI'm sorry for them already yet."
p10525
aV"Yes," murmured the Secretary.
p10526
aV"It is a very good idea.
p10527
aVI\u000acomprehend with clearness, and up to a certain point I agree--"\u000a\u000a"I don't believe it," said McGennis flatly.
p10528
aV"Listen, Secretario.
p10529
aVI'm going away, _sabe_?
p10530
aVNo more Sicaba in mine!
p10531
aVNo more bridges and\u000aharbors in a cat's eye, but some real live Igaroots and a bunch of\u000apicks and shovels and a road you can _see_!
p10532
aVAnd _dynamite_!
p10533
aVLord,\u000aSecretario, you don't know how good it'll seem to hear a real noise\u000aagain, and--"\u000a\u000aMcGennis stopped suddenly, for something in his words had at last\u000apenetrated to the Secretary's understanding.
p10534
aVSlowly the worthy\u000aofficer put down his cup.
p10535
aVSlowly he got to his feet, and over his\u000abroad, dull face a little procession of emotions made its slow way.
p10536
aVJovial interest gave place to surprise, surprise to dismay, and at\u000alast a heavy hopelessness settled on it.
p10537
aV"You go away from Sicaba,\u000aMagheenis?"
p10538
aVhe asked.
p10539
aVAnd then he plumped down into his chair again\u000aand sat there, an embodiment of chuckle-headed woe.
p10540
aV"Lord," said McGennis to himself, looking at his victim contritely,\u000a"I ought not to have tossed it out at him that way."
p10541
aVIt was a relief that just at that moment a white-clad native teacher\u000ashould come to the door of the schoolhouse on the far side of the\u000a_plaza_ and ring a bell with nervous, insistent strokes.
p10542
aVMcGennis\u000ajerked out his watch, and realized that for the first time in Sicaba\u000ahe was late in beginning his day.
p10543
aV"Stay as long as you want to,\u000aSecretario," he called back, rushing for the stairs.
p10544
aVThe Secretary\u000asat motionless, and McGennis, plunging out into the sunshine, felt a\u000asecond pang of contrition for having tossed it out so suddenly.
p10545
aVBut his regret was only momentary.
p10546
aVSomehow the morning sparkled as\u000anever morning had outside God's own country, and the Deputy\u000aSupervisor, pushing across the _plaza_ with long, boyish strides,\u000aresponded to it.
p10547
aV"Going away, going away," was the refrain his feet\u000apatted out.
p10548
aVAway from Sicaba, away from isolation and obscurity, out\u000ato the big, big chance which waited him.
p10549
aVAnd the chief had been\u000awatching him, canny old Stewart who said so little and saw so much\u000awith those narrowed gray eyes of his; hard-mouthed Stewart, who\u000ahandled his forces for the overthrow of Botany and Geology, down\u000athere in Bacolot, as a general handles his troops.
p10550
aVAnd Stewart,\u000awhose approval was a grunt, had said in so many words that he,\u000aMcGennis, had made good.
p10551
aVTruly, it paid to cut your notches and let\u000athe Stewarts look out for the meaning of them.
p10552
aVHis eager, keen face was so bright, as he cut across the angle where\u000achurch and convent wall a corner of the _plaza_, that the men who had\u000abeen puttering there with stones and cement dropped their work to\u000asing out cheery "_Maayong agas_" a dozen of them in a volley.
p10553
aV"_Maayong aga, amigos_," returned McGennis, and hesitated.
p10554
aVHe was\u000aalready late for school, but then school is not one of the duties of\u000aan engineer in charge of half a province.
p10555
aVOne of the few duties that\u000aisn't his, McGennis had thought sometimes.
p10556
aVStill, this school of\u000aSicaba, in a way--\u000a\u000aSomehow McGennis's mind was working in quick flashes, and even as he\u000ahung there on his heel he saw again just how that school had become\u000aone of his duties, and laughed grimly to think of it.
p10557
aVThere had been a Maestro in Sicaba once, a bespectacled American from\u000aan East effete beyond words, but chronic indigestion--coupled with a\u000acoldness in the feet equally chronic, thought McGennis, with light\u000ascorn--had caused his early departure.
p10558
aVAnd then the school, in the\u000ahands of four warring native teachers, male and female, had been\u000agoing to the dogs, until McGennis, with his inherent dislike for\u000aseeing anything go to the dogs uncombatted, had, with a deft jerk of\u000athe wrist, straightened those four warring pedagogues into their\u000acollars and kept them there, till a Deputy Superintendent of Schools\u000ahad come riding up from Bacolot to see what was to be done about it.
p10559
aVMcGennis still remembered that trim, slim, innocent-eyed Deputy with\u000aregretful admiration.
p10560
aV"I reckon," McGennis had remarked, with the impersonal contempt of an\u000aEngineer speaking to a Teacher, "you'll be sending up another\u000aglass-eyed Dictionary to snarl 'em all up--"\u000a\u000a"I don't know," the Deputy Superintendent had said thoughtfully.
p10561
aV"You've done surprisingly well with them yourself."
p10562
aV"That," McGennis retorted, with huge sarcasm, "is because I've got\u000anothing else to do."
p10563
aV"In that case," the Deputy had said, looking at him with smiling\u000ainnocence, "I'll let you keep the school, just to fill up the time."
p10564
aVAnd then, unexpectedly, he had swung to his saddle and flicked a\u000aspurred heel, and gone galloping away, his big Colt's swinging at his\u000atrim waist, and left McGennis wrathful yet admiring.
p10565
aV"I say, Mr. McGennis," had been his parting shot, "try to keep their\u000aaccent and vocabulary back as close to the Mississippi as you can,\u000awon't you?"
p10566
aVRather than quit, McGennis had taken the school and kept the restive\u000ateachers in line by counsel and admonition, and had even, when he was\u000ain town, taught for an hour each morning himself, smiling with lofty\u000acontempt for his womanish occupation as he revealed to his pupils an\u000aaccent and vocabulary which had never been east of the Missouri.
p10567
aVIn\u000aa way it was his school, but the work those men were doing at the\u000aangle of the _plaza_ was infinitely more his work, and, late or not,\u000ahe swung on his heel for a look at it.
p10568
aVOf all his schemes for the redemption of Sicaba, that culvert and its\u000atributary ditches was his pet.
p10569
aVIt had been a nice problem in\u000adrainage in a town whose highest ridge rose only a meter above high\u000awater, and which yet seemed to have an inexhaustible capacity for\u000agetting wet and staying wetter.
p10570
aVThe water had lain two feet deep all\u000aover the _plaza_, the last rains, and a score of men, fathers of\u000afamilies, had wrapped their faces in their clammy cotton blankets and\u000adied stolidly of fever, to say nothing of the women and the babies.
p10571
aVThe babies had been the worst of it.
p10572
aVIt made him growl out ugly\u000acurses to see the tiny coffins borne out of the church, two and three\u000aand four a day, with their tawdry draperies of pink calico draggled\u000aand beaten by wind and rain.
p10573
aVHe had made up his mind that it must\u000astop.
p10574
aVAnd it was stopped now, if Yankee ingenuity counted for\u000aanything, McGennis thought, as he looked down at the clean green\u000amortar of his culvert.
p10575
aV"Is it good?"
p10576
aVthe foreman of the masons asked anxiously.
p10577
aVThe Deputy Supervisor surveyed the work with puckered brows.
p10578
aV"Fine,\u000aMiguel," he said genially.
p10579
aV"Couldn't be better," and the workmen\u000asmiled at each other like pleased children.
p10580
aV"Two, three, four days, it will be done," Miguel said proudly.
p10581
aV"Great!"
p10582
aVcried his ruler.
p10583
aV"You're a hustler.
p10584
aVYou and I've got a\u000alittle Irish in us, I reckon, hey?"
p10585
aVAnd then, chuckling over the\u000abewilderment his speech had caused, he resumed his light-hearted way\u000ato school.
p10586
aVThe big, sunny boys' room, where blackboards were fastened\u000aincongruously and perilously to nipa walls and bright-eyed,\u000awhite-frocked Oriental youngsters sat at American desks when they\u000amust, and drew their legs up to squat comfortably at other times, was\u000avery cheerful ordinarily, far and away the homiest place in Sicaba.
p10587
aVBut as McGennis entered, he met a chilly air.
p10588
aVFor eleven months he\u000ahad been impressing the beauty of punctuality on his charges, and now\u000ahe had his reward.
p10589
aVThe children stared with round-eyed disapproval.
p10590
aVThe teachers greeted him with frosty courtesy.
p10591
aVWith twinkling eyes, McGennis marched to the desk.
p10592
aV"I am late," he\u000areported meekly, "and--I will let Alejandro Angel name my punishment."
p10593
aVThat was an inspiration.
p10594
aVThe angelic Alexander turned stiff with\u000aresponsibility.
p10595
aV"I sink," he announced at last, "we s'all all estay\u000aafter eschool an' Meestair Magheenis s'all tell dhe estory of dhe\u000aPrincesa who wass esleepy."
p10596
aVA stir of approval greeted his\u000apronouncement.
p10597
aVThe Sleeping Beauty was dear to the hearts of younger\u000aSicaba.
p10598
aVHaving made his peace, McGennis passed on to his own little room.
p10599
aVAnd there, while detachments advanced to storm under his leadership\u000athe rough terrain of English speech, he fell to thinking again of his\u000awonderful fortune.
p10600
aVHe would make those Igorrotes work, and he would\u000alearn all their legends and crafts and games, and they would be his\u000apeople.
p10601
aVJust as the people of Sicaba were.
p10602
aVMcGennis, glancing down at the long bench where a platoon of his\u000apeople sat with the impishly angelic Alexander at one end--the lower\u000aone--and the wan-faced village hunchback at the other, felt a sudden\u000apang.
p10603
aVFor the first time he realized that some professional\u000apedagogue, some glass-eyed Dictionary, some heavy-handed, solemn\u000afellow, might have those boys he had made his.
p10604
aVIf any one must come,\u000ahe hoped it might be--McGennis ransacked his fancy for the sort of\u000aman he wanted.
p10605
aVAnd he could not find one!
p10606
aVAt that he laughed\u000aoutright.
p10607
aV"You're getting green-eyed," he said to himself, in\u000ahumorous surprise.
p10608
aV"Teacher, what is green-eye?"
p10609
aVdemanded the hunchback, and McGennis\u000aknew that he had spoken his thought.
p10610
aV"Green-eyed means a gazabo that thinks he's It," he explained\u000apromptly; and "What is gazabo, Teacher?"
p10611
aVdemanded the tireless\u000apursuer after knowledge.
p10612
aV"Time's up," said McGennis laughing.
p10613
aV"Rush along the next gang,\u000aAlejandro, and if I catch you chewing _bunga_ in school again I'll\u000awring your neck, _sabe_?"
p10614
aVWhen the one hour of his unmanly work was done and the last\u000adetachment had departed, McGennis lingered for a moment in the little\u000aroom, looking out on the _plaza_, and his eyes were very thoughtful,\u000aalmost wistful.
p10615
aV"I reckon," he muttered, "a fellow'd hate to leave\u000athe Hot Place if he'd been there long enough to get acquainted," and\u000ahe seized his hat and hurried over to his office in the big,\u000ahalf-ruinous convent which served Sicaba for municipal headquarters.
p10616
aVHis step was not so wholly buoyant as it had been in the morning, and\u000athe world was not quite so youthfully exuberant.
p10617
aVNot that it was\u000adead, as he had seen it so often from his window at sunrise.
p10618
aVIt was\u000asimply--homelike.
p10619
aVAnd in his office, too, buoyancy was lacking.
p10620
aVInstead of taking up\u000athe work he had laid aside the night before, and it was work which\u000amust be finished quickly if he meant to leave his house in order, he\u000asat stupidly for a while, and then, half unconsciously, he reached up\u000ato a shelf and took down some blue-prints of work which could not be\u000adone for years.
p10621
aVNot till all those roads and bridges had some\u000ahabitation more local than a cat's eye.
p10622
aVThere was the swamp, Manapla\u000away, a hundred good square miles of rich black mud where cacao would\u000agrow like a weed, and only a thousand cubic meters of drainage canal\u000awere needed, twelve hundred at the outside--\u000a\u000aThere was the growing bar at the mouth of Cadiz Viejo river.
p10623
aVOne\u000ajetty, placed knowingly, would scoop that out, and there was an ideal\u000aplace for a dock--McGennis's short brown hand smoothed the curling\u000ablue-prints lovingly, as he fell to thinking again of an unescapable\u000asuccessor.
p10624
aVWhom could Stewart send?
p10625
aVThere was Haskins.
p10626
aVHaskins had\u000athe education, McGennis admitted reverently, and could draw like a\u000aruling-machine and figure like a comptometer.
p10627
aVBut Haskins couldn't\u000amake a monkey catch fleas, and the North Coast needed a driver, a\u000ahard-handed--and yet not too hard.
p10628
aVBrown could make 'em hustle all\u000aright, but he would have a new fight on every day.
p10629
aVWhat the North\u000aCoast needed was a jollier--like Henry?
p10630
aVNo, Henry was a good fellow\u000aall right, but he made things cost like contract work in Frisco, and\u000athe North Coast was pitifully poor.
p10631
aVWhat it needed was a contriver\u000alike--like--well, like--\u000a\u000a"Oh, hell!"
p10632
aVsaid McGennis profanely.
p10633
aVSuddenly he stood very straight\u000aabove his draughting-table, for his door had opened.
p10634
aVThe Municipal Secretary and the Municipal Presidente came in.
p10635
aVThey\u000aseemed to radiate an air of funerals, and McGennis's boisterous\u000agreeting died in his throat.
p10636
aVThe Secretary halted just inside the\u000adoor and stood looking down, a lumpish statue of grief.
p10637
aVThe\u000aPresidente, a spare, eager-faced young native, came forward to\u000aMcGennis's table.
p10638
aV"Damn!"
p10639
aVsaid McGennis softly, looking at him.
p10640
aV"Seor Magheenis," said the Presidente, "the Seor Secretario says\u000athat you will go away.
p10641
aVAssure me that he is mistaken."
p10642
aVMcGennis started a light answer, and cut it short.
p10643
aV"It's true,\u000aPresidente," he said briefly.
p10644
aV"But," said the Presidente, "where go all our plans which we made\u000atogether?
p10645
aVRemember how we talked?
p10646
aVYou shall teach me how the good\u000aPresidentes--the Mayors--in America do, and so shall even Sicaba be\u000amade American also."
p10647
aV"I'm sorry, Presidente," said McGennis, "but you see--"\u000a\u000a"I comprehend," said the Presidente.
p10648
aV"We are too little, too poor,\u000atoo worthless, to take the strength, the teaching, of a man like\u000ayou--"\u000a\u000a"Oh, cut it out!"
p10649
aVMcGennis begged.
p10650
aV"It is not to be expected, and I do not expect it, now that I\u000acomprehend."
p10651
aVThere was a simple and impressive dignity in the little\u000aPresidente.
p10652
aV"But what comes to Sicaba, and to me?
p10653
aVExcuse me,\u000a_Magheenis amigo_.
p10654
aVI can not talk more now.
p10655
aVBefore you go I shall\u000asee you and thank you, but excuse me now."
p10656
aV"Damn!"
p10657
aVsaid McGennis savagely, looking after the two silent figures\u000aas they went out.
p10658
aV"What right have they got," he demanded sharply of\u000aSome One, "to expect me to drool away my whole life up here in this\u000aGod-forsaken hole?
p10659
aVHere, you," he shouted roughly to the\u000aman-of-all-work about his office, "get my horse saddled up, quick.
p10660
aVI've got to ride out and take a look at that cut on the Segovia road."
p10661
aVAnd so he rode away and escaped a day of unwonted excitement in\u000aSicaba as the news spread.
p10662
aVPeople told it to each other as they\u000astood in twos and threes before the little _tiendas_, and the greater\u000amen of the town, gathered in the earthen-floored caf, drank cognac\u000ain unusual and dangerous quantities, three and four thimblefuls, some\u000aof them; and the school children talked of it, tearfully, and the\u000amonkeyish little constabulary soldiers in their lime-washed\u000abarrack--McGennis had given _them_ a touch of that pliant\u000amule-driver's wrist of his, once or twice, when their inspector had\u000abeen absent riding along the eighty miles of ladrone-harried coast\u000awhich was his charge.
p10663
aVIn all Sicaba only the Municipal Secretary, sitting in his office\u000awith an unlighted cigar between his pudgy fingers, and the young\u000aPresidente pacing up and down somewhere in his big house beside\u000aSicaba River, did not speak of McGennis's going.
p10664
aVIt was toward the end of the afternoon when the Deputy Supervisor\u000arode back, himself again.
p10665
aVOut there in the open, with the sun and\u000awind about him, his brain had cleared.
p10666
aVThese people had no mortgage\u000aon his future.
p10667
aVIt was a wrench breaking old ties, but not to do it\u000ain this case would be a piece\u000aof--back-beyond-the-foot-hills--sentimentality.
p10668
aVSo when he turned into the first street of the little city and a man\u000astepped out from a tienda and asked: "You go away, Seor Magheenis?"
p10669
aVMcGennis, jogging along with a smile on his face, was ready for him.
p10670
aV"Sure," he said carelessly.
p10671
aVBut he was not ready for what followed.
p10672
aVFor the man put a hand to\u000ahis mouth and called shrilly: "It is true," and from every _tienda_\u000adown the length of that long street, men and women came out and stood\u000alooking up at him, silently, sorrowfully, questioningly, as if there\u000awere something they wanted to understand, and couldn't.
p10673
aVBefore\u000aMcGennis was half-way to the _plaza_, his smile was a savage grin,\u000aand he had kicked the big horse into a thundering gallop.
p10674
aVAnd so he\u000arode down between the rows of silent people, looking straight ahead.
p10675
aVHe had reached the _plaza_, and was swinging his horse for the corner\u000awhere his house was, when the sight of the schoolhouse on the farther\u000aside checked him.
p10676
aVThis hour, just before sunset, had come to be the\u000aone playtime hour of his busy days, and he spent it at the school.
p10677
aVNot as a teacher, nor among the boys who were his unofficial pupils.
p10678
aVAt the other end of the school from the boys' room was another\u000aequally big room crowded full of girls, and it was there, oddly\u000aenough, that McGennis spent the one happy hour when he did not have\u000ato be a Deputy Supervisor.
p10679
aVOddly, for, as McGennis put it, he "had no use for skirts."
p10680
aVIn his\u000ashort, tempestuous life he had seen many good men wasted for love of\u000awomen, and far from being curious at their fate and the causes of it,\u000ahe had drawn back into himself till he regarded the softer half of\u000ahumankind with a suspicion which bordered on hatred.
p10681
aVBut there were women of another sort.
p10682
aVTiny things whose little\u000aclinging fingers could hardly circle one of his stubby ones.
p10683
aVWee\u000athings of such primal innocence that, as they stood unclad at the\u000avillage wells, with their plump little brown bodies shining in the\u000asun, and their wisps of black hair hanging all draggled about their\u000afaces, while their mothers poured water over them, they looked up\u000aunabashed if he came riding by, and smiled up friendlily, and lisped\u000a"Good-a-mornin'."
p10684
aVOf such women McGennis had no fear, and so it had come about, very\u000agradually, that after all the others were gone, these little ones\u000awaited in the big room till McGennis came with a wonderfully colored\u000abook, and then, with shining eyes and tiny gurgles of excited\u000alaughter, they closed about him and wormed their warm little selves\u000ainside his arms and balanced precariously on his shoulders, steadying\u000athemselves by his hair, and lay piled, a heap of eager heads and\u000aforgotten arms and legs, on the big table where the book was, while\u000athe Deputy Supervisor revealed to them the thrilling difference\u000abetween a peach and an apple, and the astonishing unlikeness of\u000aeither to a violet.
p10685
aVAnd any one who had come unseen on McGennis\u000athen, would hardly have known him for a Deputy Supervisor.
p10686
aVMcGennis, at the _plaza_ corner, felt suddenly that these friends of\u000ahis were waiting for him then, and he could not bear to disappoint\u000athem.
p10687
aVSo he swung the big horse and galloped across and rolled from\u000ahis saddle at the schoolhouse door and pushed it open and took one\u000astep inside, and stopped.

aVFor from the benches and the crowded table there rose a wail of\u000ainfantile despair, so shrill and queerly, pipingly minor, so very\u000amanifestly the outpouring of very tiny broken hearts, that it was\u000alike a toy wail, almost ludicrous in its imitation of the real thing.

aVFor an instant he stood, and then\u000ahe turned and closed the door with fumbling fingers, and took the few\u000asteps to his horse stumblingly, and climbed heavily into his saddle,\u000aand with loose reins rode off to his house and went up to his _ssla_\u000aand sat down there, looking blindly out on Sicaba.

aV[Illustration: "_With loose reins rode off to his house._"]\u000a\u000aThe sunset came, brightened, and faded, and passed away, and night\u000ashut down over Sicaba, and still he sat there.
p10692
aVHis muchacho came to\u000alight a lamp, and McGennis sent him away.
p10693
aVLater his cook came,\u000aspeaking authoritatively of dinner, and McGennis sent his cook away,\u000atoo, and sat on in the dark.
p10694
aVAt last it was the hour when even Sicaba, for a little while, must\u000aseem beautiful to the most hostile critic.
p10695
aVIt is the hour when the\u000afull power of night descends upon the world, when the wind dies away\u000ato the merest murmur, and the drone of the surf becomes deep and\u000asolemn, and the great yellow stars burn very steadily against the\u000asoft velvet of the sky.
p10696
aVWhen that hour came, McGennis stirred, and stood up suddenly, and\u000alaid his hands on the broad sill of his window and looked down at\u000aSicaba and up to the stars.
p10697
aV"Of course I'm going to stay," he\u000amuttered impatiently, as if Some One had asked him a question.

aVWhen the light was brought, he sat down at his table and drew pen and\u000apaper to him and began to write.
p10702
aV"Donald G. Stewart, C.E.," he wrote, tracing the magic initials with\u000areverent care.
p10703
aVMcGennis would never write C.E.

p10720
aVAs he entered his bedroom, holding his chimneyless lamp high that the\u000areek of it might not draw into his nostrils, his eye lighted on the\u000ajagged post in the corner.
p10721
aV"Well," said McGennis, looking at it,\u000a"she's all notched up for a couple of weeks, anyhow.

p10723
aVThe boyish smile curled his firm young lips once more, as\u000athe fool part of him began to amuse the other parts.
p10724
aVAnd then,\u000acontentedly, he turned to his canvas cot, with the heavy, blue-gray\u000ablankets spread upon it.
p10725
aVIt is hard and narrow and monkish, that couch which the world\u000aprovides for so many of her fighting men and pioneers, but to\u000aMcGennis it seemed a Place of Rest.

aVAnd now,\u000ahaving relived that life for an hour, I have come back again to the\u000aold house which stands so quiet among the frost-bitten New England\u000awoods and fields where sober-living men are providing cannily against\u000athe coming winter, in full faith that their precautions will avail,\u000athat a Great God rules who permits no Little Gods to turn His world\u000atopsyturvy.

p10735
aVThe East you have seen is the real East, stripped of its\u000aglamour and its color, a land where nothing is sacred, where there\u000aare indeed no Ten Commandments--no Commander, it seems sometimes--a\u000aland of uncertainty and empty Fatalism._\u000a\u000a_Better, it seems to me, a little less of zest and color, and a\u000alittle more of ballasting Hope._\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTHE END.

p10857
aVCHAPTER I.\u000a\u000a\u000aJanet Summerhayes did not start in life with the feelings usually\u000aattributed to the young governess when beginning what is certainly a\u000avery thankless trade, with about as little prospect of continued\u000aprosperity as any in the world.
p10858
aVMany representations of that sad and\u000aresigned young heroine have appeared before the world.
p10859
aVWe all know the\u000aappearance of the slight girl in deep mourning shyly coming into a\u000astrange house and a new world, shrinking alike from kindness and\u000aneglect; feeling that she is likely to be shut out there from everything\u000athat is agreeable, expecting humiliation, and, if not ready to take\u000aoffence, at least quite aware that nobody is likely to take her feelings\u000ainto consideration, or think that she is made of young flesh and blood\u000alike the others.
p10860
aVThere are many excuses for this frame of mind, and in\u000amany cases the worst prognostics are carried out.
p10861
aVBut I am very glad to\u000asay that this was not at all the idea with which the subject of this\u000astory prepared to go forth upon the world.
p10862
aVHer position up to this time had not been like that of the young and\u000agentle governess of romance, an exceptionally sheltered and happy one.
p10863
aVShe had not been the only daughter of a doting father or mother, whose\u000awant of means to provide for her was only discovered upon their sudden\u000adeath.
p10864
aVOn the contrary, Janet\u2019s experience was entirely that of a\u000adependent.
p10865
aVIt is true the dependence was more or less a natural one.
p10866
aVShe\u000awas a relation of her patroness, and she had grown up from childhood in\u000aMiss Philipson\u2019s house, without any consciousness that it was not her\u000ahome, and with much of the feelings of a child, always subject, always\u000aliable to be ordered about and reproved, and little considered, but only\u000ain a way common to children.
p10867
aVShe had been very well educated on the\u000awhole, very well cared for, nicely dressed, since that was quite\u000aaccording to the fitness of things, and not allowed in anything to fall\u000abehind the neighboring girls of her age in any pleasure or\u000aaccomplishment.
p10868
aVIt would have been contrary to Miss Philipson\u2019s credit,\u000aand it would have impaired her comfort, if Janet had not been on a level\u000awith the rest, or if she had not been cheerful and happy in her life.
p10869
aVShe was always kind to the girl, not being naturally unkind to anyone.
p10870
aVShe liked to have everything pleasant about her, and she had a\u000aconscience besides--both which things were very good for her little\u000acousin.
p10871
aVShe did not provide for Janet, but that was all--and indeed,\u000ahaving done so much for her, and given her on the whole such a happy\u000alife up to her twentieth year, there was no failure of duty in this; and\u000athough some of Janet\u2019s friends were inclined to blame Miss Philipson,\u000aJanet herself was much more just, and neither felt nor expressed any\u000ablame.
p10872
aV\u201cAunt Mary was always good to me,\u201d the girl said.
p10873
aV\u201cI had no right to\u000athat, but she gave it me freely, and we were very happy together, and\u000acertainly I had no right to expect any more.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear, I would not for the world impair your gratitude or your\u000aaffection for your poor aunt,\u201d said the vicar\u2019s wife; \u201cin many things\u000ashe deserved it fully, but----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is no \u2018but,\u2019\u201d said Janet.
p10874
aVShe was not perhaps quite so much\u000aovercome by grief as her friends would have liked to see her.
p10875
aVThere is a\u000avery simple standard in this respect which people like to see followed.
p10876
aVThey like to see a grief which is overwhelming for the moment, tears\u000awithout measure, a sorrow which can take no comfort, all the better if\u000ait makes the mourner ill, and perhaps confines her to bed for a few days\u000ain a shrouded room, without any occupation but that of brooding and\u000aweeping over her loss.
p10877
aVAnd then they expect her to cheer up--not too\u000aquickly, but with a little visible advance every day, an advance which\u000athey can feel to be owing more or less to their own sympathetic kindness\u000aand good offices.
p10878
aVJanet had to a certain extent followed this unspoken\u000arule.
p10879
aVShe had cried a great deal, though her health had not at all\u000asuffered; but after the funeral she had perhaps too quickly regained her\u000acheerfulness.
p10880
aVWhen the doctor proposed to her, which was a thing that\u000ahappened very soon after, it had been all she could do not to laugh at\u000athe droll idea that anyone should think it possible she would marry a\u000amiddle-aged country doctor, she--Janet!
p10881
aVShe did laugh in the safety of\u000aher own room where nobody could hear her, recalling his look, and all\u000athe peculiarities of his unattractive person and his rough riding dress.
p10882
aVHe wanted to save her from the life of a governess by binding her to\u000ahim, and his shabby house, and his busy, dry, joyless existence.
p10883
aVHow\u000aextraordinary, how ludicrous it was that anybody should think it was\u000abetter to vegetate than to go out into the world and seek your fortune!
p10884
aVJanet had lived at Clover all her life, and she liked the little place.
p10885
aVThe scenes were all so familiar, the people were all friends; but then\u000ashe never for a moment supposed that she could be bound to such a\u000aseclusion.
p10886
aVIt had always been her expectation that one time or another\u000ashe was to fling herself forth upon the world.
p10887
aVAt the vicarage they were exceedingly tender of the girl who was going\u000aforth upon fate like this.
p10888
aVMrs.
p10889
aVBland made a survey of all her clothes,\u000aand mended some and condemned others with a pathetic tenderness.
p10890
aV\u201cYou must have all your linen in order,\u201d she said, \u201cfor there is nothing\u000aa girl is so apt to forget.
p10891
aVI was in rags myself when my first wedding\u000aoutfit wore out before I ever thought of getting a new set of things.
p10892
aVA\u000agirl can see when she wants a new frock, but as for her under-things she\u000aalways leaves that to her mother.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut you forget, Mrs.
p10893
aVBland, I have never had a mother,\u201d said Janet.
p10894
aV\u201cAh, my poor child!
p10895
aVbut you were very kindly thought of, Janet, very\u000akindly.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you think I meant any reproach to poor Aunt Mary?
p10896
aVOh, no, no!
p10897
aVShe\u000aliked me to have everything.
p10898
aVShe liked me to be the best dressed child\u000ain the parish.
p10899
aVBut as I grew up I saw to it myself.
p10900
aVShe thought it was\u000abest for me.
p10901
aVBut I shall always take the most care of the buttons you\u000ahave sewed on.
p10902
aVFancy sewing on buttons and seeing after tapes for me!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is the most natural thing in the world,\u201d said the vicaress.
p10903
aV\u201cI only\u000awish I could always take the charge of you, Janet; but we are old\u000apeople, and we have little to leave, and it would only be putting off a\u000alittle what would have to be faced at last.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDear Mrs.
p10904
aVBland!\u201d cried Janet, looking at her with something like tears\u000ain her eyes: they were real tears--and yet even while they sprang by\u000ainstinct of nature, the little thing could not help the rising of a\u000arevolt against the thought of settling again at Clover after she had\u000aonce been unseated from her corner.
p10905
aVAt Clover!
p10906
aVwhen what she was\u000athinking of was the world.
p10907
aV\u201cBut you must promise me, my dear,\u201d said the old lady, with a tremor in\u000aher voice, \u201cthat as long as we live you will always look on the vicarage\u000aas your home.
p10908
aVIf this Mrs. Harwood should not turn out all you expect,\u000ayou must not think it necessary to stay on, you know, and fret yourself\u000ato death trying to make it do.
p10909
aVYou must always remember you have a home\u000ato come back to, Janet.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut the vicar thought Mrs. Harwood was very nice.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSo he did, but in such cases a man\u2019s opinion does not go for very much.
p10910
aVIf a woman looks nice and talks nicely, and has an agreeable smile, it\u000ais all the vicar thinks of: and most people are nice to him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow could they help it, he is so delightful himself?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, I tell you, he is no judge; and in the best of places, Janet,\u000athere is a great deal to put up with.
p10911
aVEvery family has its own ways, and\u000ayou will be a stranger, and it will be hard for you to be left out and\u000ato feel yourself always an outsider.
p10912
aVThere is a young lady, and she will\u000ago out to her parties and balls and you will be left behind.
p10913
aVI don\u2019t\u000amean that you will feel it now, when your spirit is broken, but by and\u000aby, when in the course of nature----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt would be just the same at Clover,\u201d said Janet; \u201cthere are neither\u000aballs nor parties.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh, but everything there is you are asked to.
p10914
aVThat makes such a\u000adifference: and it will not be the case there.
p10915
aVMy dear, I am frightened\u000aabout you, for you are too bold.
p10916
aVYou don\u2019t realize the difference.
p10917
aVIt\u000awill be a great difference,\u201d said Mrs.
p10918
aVBland, shaking her head.
p10919
aVJanet could have laughed, but did not.
p10920
aVShe was very bold.
p10921
aVThe new life\u000aand the strange family had no terrors for her.
p10922
aVNovelty was dear, an\u000aexhilaration not a terror, to this little girl.
p10923
aVHer heart was beating\u000ahigh with expectation while all these prophecies were poured into her\u000aear.
p10924
aVBut it would not have been in good taste (Janet felt) to exhibit\u000athe real state of her feelings, so she answered, demurely, that she\u000ahoped she was not too bold.
p10925
aV\u201cBut, dear Mrs.
p10926
aVBland, when one has to do it, don\u2019t you think one had\u000abetter try to do it cheerily and think the best?
p10927
aVDon\u2019t you remember the\u000aold song in the play that the vicar likes so much--\u000a\u000a    \u201c\u2018A merry heart goes all the way\u000a      A sad one tires in a mile, a\u2019!\u201d\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s true enough,\u201d said Mrs.
p10928
aVBland, still shaking her head, \u201cbut men\u000adon\u2019t know half that women have to put up with.
p10929
aVAnyhow, Janet, my poor\u000adear, you must always recollect this, that if it should ever become more\u000athan you can bear you must just give up the struggle and come back\u000ahome.
p10930
aVThis is home so long as he and I are alive, and, if he goes first,\u000awhatever poor little cottage I may get to hide my old head in, you\u2019ll\u000ajust be as welcome there; and if I go first there will be all the more\u000aoccasion, for he will sorely want somebody to look after him.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt the mingled prospect of Janet\u2019s need, and her own poor little\u000aproblematical cottage as the vicar\u2019s widow, and the vicar\u2019s want of\u000asomebody to look after him, Mrs.
p10931
aVBland broke down entirely, and shed\u000asalt tears.
p10932
aVIndeed, those things were all possible, though only one of\u000athe last two sorrows could be.
p10933
aVBut when an old pair come to the end of\u000alife, it is almost certain that one of them must be left one day to\u000asurvive and miss the other, though, to be sure, it does happen now and\u000athen that they are so blessed as to die within a day or two of each\u000aother, which is by far the best.
p10934
aVJanet went to her old friend, and kissed her, and was, as Mrs.
p10935
aVBland\u000asaid, very sweet, comforting the old lady with tender words and letting\u000afall a few tears, as it is easy on any provocation to do at nineteen.
p10936
aVAnd immediately after it was tea-time, and the vicar came in from his\u000astudy, where he was writing his sermon, and everything became cheerful\u000aagain.
p10937
aVAfterwards Mrs.
p10938
aVBland put all Janet\u2019s \u201cthings\u201d together, and\u000alooked at them with affectionate, complacent eyes, patting each snowy\u000aheap.
p10939
aV\u201cNow, Janet,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have a dozen of each, my dear, and not a\u000abutton or a tape wanting, and all the trimmings nice and in good order.
p10940
aVThat will last you for a long time.
p10941
aVYou must keep an eye upon the\u000atrimming, which London washerwomen tear dreadfully.
p10942
aVI\u2019ve put our\u000aold-fashioned Buckinghamshire lace, made in my old parish where I was\u000aborn, upon all the new ones.
p10943
aVThere is nothing that wears and washes so\u000awell.
p10944
aVYou never have had to think of these things till now; but you must\u000apromise me to look them over carefully every Saturday.
p10945
aVYou know, \u2018A\u000astitch in time----\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet gave the promise with all necessary earnestness, and the \u201cthings\u201d\u000awere carried upstairs and carefully packed.
p10946
aVIt was a sad evening at the\u000avicarage.
p10947
aVThe old people said all manner of sweet and pretty things to\u000athe neophyte, which Janet tried when she could to ward off by a little\u000ajoke, or one of the merry little speeches which all the Clover people\u000aexpected from her: but, though this might turn the edge of a piece of\u000aserious advice for a moment, the grave tone always came back.
p10948
aVA sentence\u000amight be begun lightly, but it was sure to end with \u201cremember,\u000aJanet----\u201d The old people both kissed her and blessed her when she went\u000aupstairs to bed--\u201cThe last night,\u201d they said to each other with an\u000ainterchange of sympathetic glances.
p10949
aV\u201cAnd she takes it so easily.
p10950
aVShe is not a bit daunted,\u201d said Mrs.
p10951
aVBland,\u000ashaking her head.
p10952
aV\u201cPerhaps that\u2019s all the better,\u201d said the vicar; but the old couple were\u000aalmost alarmed, in spite of themselves, at Janet\u2019s calm.
p10953
aVIf they had but known!
p10954
aVShe went upstairs quietly enough with a composed\u000astep.
p10955
aVBut when she got to her own room, which was, happily, at the other\u000aend of the house, Janet threw down on her bed the things she was\u000acarrying, which were presents from her old friends--a writing-case from\u000aone, a work-basket from the other--and danced, actually danced a lively\u000aold hornpipe step, which she had learned when she was a child.
p10956
aVShe did\u000ait before the glass, and nodded and smiled at herself as she bobbed up\u000aand down.
p10957
aVThen stretching out her arms, flung herself in the old\u000aeasy-chair and, said, \u201cHurrah!
p10958
aVhurrah!
p10959
aVhurrah!\u201d softly under her breath\u000a\u201cThe last night,\u201d said Janet to herself.
p10960
aVThe last of all this dull old\u000alife, which she knew in every feature, which never had anything new in\u000ait--no excitement, no change: but to do the same things at the same\u000ahours every day, and come in to meals and sit down in the same chair,\u000aand go to church and go to bed.
p10961
aVShe was not at all without affection for\u000athe people who were so kind to her, but to feel herself upon the edge of\u000athe unknown went to Janet\u2019s head.
p10962
aVIt was like laughing gas, or\u000achampagne, or any other stimulant to gayety.
p10963
aVThe idea intoxicated her.
p10964
aVAs for all the dolorous pictures that had been placed before her, she\u000abelieved none of them.
p10965
aVTo go off among people she had never seen, to\u000aplunge into the midst of a life she knew nothing about, to become a\u000amember of a family whose name alone she knew--it was like beginning a\u000anew world to Janet.
p10966
aVShe would have everything to find about them--their\u000aChristian names, their stories, if they had any; perhaps the family\u000astory, if there was one--the skeleton in the closet, the romance;\u000awhatever there might be.
p10967
aVWhat fun!
p10968
aVshe said to herself, clapping her\u000ahands.
p10969
aVEven the new place would be something to begin with--the new home\u000aand customs, the new rooms.
p10970
aVIt appeared to her altogether in a bright light of\u000aexpectation--everything nice, everything new.
p10971
aVThe name of Mrs. Harwood,\u000aa widow lady with three children, living in St. John\u2019s Wood, will not,\u000aperhaps, appear exciting at the first glance.
p10972
aVShe was Mrs.
p10973
aVNovelty, the\u000agatekeeper of the new world, to Janet, and her three children were three\u000aromances about to begin, in each of which Janet would come by degrees to\u000abe the heroine.
p10974
aVThe house in St. John\u2019s Wood was the theatre, the stage\u000aon which she was to make her first appearance.
p10975
aVShe knew no more of that\u000arespectable (or disrespectable) region than she did of Timbuctoo.
p10976
aVAs for\u000athe naughtiness, that was all a sealed book to Janet.
p10977
aVHer wildest\u000athoughts were as innocent as a child\u2019s.
p10978
aVShe had absolute ignorance as a\u000aguard to her imagination, which is a guard always to be desired, and\u000amost so at nineteen.
p10979
aVThe life she longed to know was the common life of\u000athe world.
p10980
aVNot even in her dreams had she thought of the transgression\u000aof any law.
p10981
aVShe expected to have her own merits recognized, to have\u000aadoration and homage laid at her feet, to find not only Prince Charming\u000ain the end, but, no doubt, many others whose sighs and glances would\u000amake existence very amusing.
p10982
aVShe expected that admiration would meet\u000aher, that she would be in the midst of a story before she knew.
p10983
aVShe\u000aexpected to triumph all along the line.
p10984
aV\u201cThe world\u2019s my oyster, which\u000awith this glance I\u2019ll open.\u201d That was the light in which Janet\u000acontemplated the life of a governess in St. John\u2019s Wood, which she was\u000ato begin next day.
p10985
aVCHAPTER II.
p10986
aVThe household at the vicarage was astir earlier than usual next morning,\u000awhich was altogether unnecessary, for Jane did not leave Clover till\u000aafter twelve o\u2019clock; but that was a kind of tribute to the excitement\u000ain which everybody had a part.
p10987
aVThe morning was spent in investigations\u000aas to whether anything was wanting in Janet\u2019s little travelling\u000awork-case, where she kept (by special provision of Mrs.
p10988
aVBland) a reel of\u000ablack silk and one of white cotton, needles, thimble, and scissors; or\u000ain her little writing-case, where (supplied by the vicar) she had two\u000asheets of notepaper, two envelopes, two post-cards, the same of postage\u000astamps, a pen on an ivory-holder, and a small travelling inkbottle.
p10989
aVThese little articles were quite independent of the handsome work-box\u000aand writing-case, severally given her by her kind friends, and were\u000aintended solely for the necessities of the journey, though, perhaps, as\u000ait was only three hours by railway to London such careful provisions\u000awere scarcely necessary.
p10990
aVJanet\u2019s box was not locked till ten o\u2019clock, in case some one might\u000arecollect something that had been forgotten; but after every precaution\u000ahad been taken, the last strap fastened, her railway rug and cloak\u000aneatly, nay, almost more than neatly, put up, her own hat put on, and\u000aher coat buttoned to the throat, not one detail left which had not been\u000aattended to, there was still one hour to spare before the train left.
p10991
aVThey went out into the wintry garden, where everything was bare, and\u000astrolled round the walks--the three together, the vicar in his\u000agreatcoat, prepared to accompany Janet to the railway, and Mrs.
p10992
aVBland\u000awith a large white shawl over her cap.
p10993
aVIt was a beautiful morning, the\u000asun shining red through the mist, and everything so warmed in color and\u000asentiment by those ruddy rays that it was almost impossible to believe\u000athat it was a cold November day.
p10994
aV\u201cI wish now,\u201d said the vicar, \u201cthat I had insisted, as I always wished,\u000aon going up with Janet to town, and seeing her safe in Mrs. Harwood\u2019s\u000ahands.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI almost wish you had, dear,\u201d said Mrs.
p10995
aVBland.
p10996
aV\u201cBut I don\u2019t,\u201d cried Janet.
p10997
aV\u201cOh, please don\u2019t think of such a thing!
p10998
aVHow\u000aam I to learn to manage for myself if you pet me like this, as if I\u000acould do nothing?
p10999
aVNo, dear vicar, I should so much prefer to part with\u000ayou here, in our own dear Clover, and to keep the--image quite\u000aunbroken.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet was a little at a loss how to finish her sentence, but felt very\u000asuccessful when she thought of these words.
p11000
aVMrs.
p11001
aVBland put up her handkerchief to her eyes.
p11002
aV\u201cThere\u2019s something in that,\u201d she said, \u201cto leave us just as I hope you\u000awill find us when you come back.
p11003
aVAnd always do remember, Janet, if any\u000adifficulty should arise, that here we are, always so happy to have\u000ayou--only sorry that we can\u2019t keep you altogether.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAlways delighted to have you,\u201d echoed the vicar, \u201cand sorry above\u000ameasure----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut I hope no difficulty will arise,\u201d said Janet, very briskly; \u201cI\u000adon\u2019t intend there should.
p11004
aVI am not quite like a little novice, am I?
p11005
aVI\u000ahave seen a little of the world.
p11006
aVI remember watching how the governess\u000aat the Grange got on, or rather how she didn\u2019t get on, and thinking had\u000aI been in her place--!
p11007
aVSo you see I am not unprepared.
p11008
aVAnd then it will\u000abe everything to know I may come back here for my holidays, when I have\u000aany.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe ought to have made a condition about that,\u201d said the vicar.
p11009
aV\u201cI have\u000abeen thinking so for some time.
p11010
aVWe should have put it down in black and\u000awhite, so many weeks at a certain time, say Christmas or Easter,\u000ainstead of leaving it to chance as we have done.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot Christmas,\u201d said Mrs.
p11011
aVBland, \u201cnor Easter either, for that would not\u000abe so convenient; but in August, when every child has holidays.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOnly then,\u201d said the vicar--\u201cfor I thought of that--they might be going\u000aabroad, or to the seaside, or somewhere where it would be nice for Janet\u000ato go.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople very seldom take the governess with them when they go abroad,\u201d\u000asaid Mrs.
p11012
aVBland, shaking her head.
p11013
aV\u201cBut, dear Mrs. Bland,\u201d said Janet, \u201cyou always used to say one should\u000anot think of holidays till one had done some work.
p11014
aVAnd it will come all\u000aright about that.
p11015
aVThe grand thing is having a place to come to when one\u000ais free; a place,\u201d she said, with a little moisture springing into a\u000acorner of her bright eyes--a little real moisture, which Janet was quite\u000apleased and almost proud to feel, as it carried out every necessity of\u000aher position--\u201cwhich will feel like home.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn every way, I hope, my dear child,\u201d said Mrs.
p11016
aVBland, with a sob,\u000aenfolding Janet in her arms and her white shawl, which were both\u000amotherly, warm, and ample, like her heart.
p11017
aVThe vicar put his hand upon\u000aher shoulder, and patted it tenderly as she was held against his wife\u2019s\u000abreast.
p11018
aVWhen the girl freed herself (and a dreadful thought about her hat darted\u000ainto her mind as she did so, for it is so easy to crush crape) she gave\u000aa little laugh, and cried,\u000a\u000a\u201cYou must not spoil me too much.
p11019
aVI can\u2019t go away crying; it would not be\u000alucky.
p11020
aVDear vicar, there is one bud left in the china vase beside your\u000astudy window.
p11021
aVDo get it for me to put in my coat, and that will be the\u000alast thing, and a cheerful thing: for it is nearly time for the train,\u000aand I must go now.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet kept her point, and pinned the rose to her breast, after she had\u000agiven Mrs.
p11022
aVBland her farewell kiss, and went away, looking back smiling\u000aand waving her hand till she was out of sight from the vicarage gate.
p11023
aV\u201cBless her, she do have a spirit to keep up like that,\u201d said the\u000avicarage cook, who stood behind her mistress to see the last of Miss\u000aJanet.
p11024
aV\u201cIt\u2019s all excitement,\u201d said Mrs.
p11025
aVBland, drying her eyes.
p11026
aV\u201cI know she\u2019ll\u000abreak down dreadfully as soon as she gets into the railway carriage by\u000aherself.\u201d\u000a\u000a       *       *       *       *       *\u000a\u000a\u201cNow, Janet, you are sure you would not wish me to go with you: for\u000athere is time enough yet to get a ticket, and send Mrs.
p11027
aVBland a\u000amessage?\u201d said the vicar, at the carriage door.
p11028
aV\u201cNo, no.
p11029
aVNo, indeed.
p11030
aVIt is far better to begin at once--to begin when I\u000aam not forced to do it,\u201d said Janet.
p11031
aV\u201cAnd perhaps next time I travel\u000aalone it will be to come home, which will make everything delightful.
p11032
aVGood-bye and, oh, thank you, thank you, a thousand times!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGod bless you, my dear child.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen he had said these last words, the vicar turned right round and\u000awalked away, for his eyes were full; and I am glad to say that Janet too\u000asaw his back, as for the first time he turned it upon her, through a\u000atear.
p11033
aVIt was an old back, in a somewhat rusty black coat, and with\u000astooping shoulders, and there was a slight quiver of emotion in it as he\u000aturned away.
p11034
aVPoor child!
p11035
aVpoor little thing, setting out upon that world\u000awhich is so cruel, which makes so small account of soft things and\u000alittle things like a bit of a girl, carrying them away upon its stream,\u000adrifting them into corners, taking all the courage and the happiness out\u000aof them.
p11036
aV\u201cGod bless her!
p11037
aVGod help her!\u201d the vicar said within himself as\u000ahe hurried away.
p11038
aVJanet had been deposited in a first-class carriage alone, with all her\u000alittle properties carefully arranged about her.
p11039
aVHenceforward probably\u000ashe would have to travel by second or even third-class; but Mr.
p11040
aVBland\u000ahad got her ticket for this last occasion regardless of expense, and had\u000afee\u2019d the guard to take care of her, and done everything for her as if\u000ashe had been a princess.
p11041
aVAnd I am happy to state that for the first mile\u000aor two Janet saw the familiar landscape all dilated and out of drawing\u000athrough the medium of tears.
p11042
aVThey were not many, nor were they bitter,\u000abut at least they were genuine.
p11043
aV\u201cPoor old vicar,\u201d she said to herself; \u201cpoor Mrs.
p11044
aVBland; poor Aunt\u000aMary----\u201d\u000a\u000aEven at that moment it was not herself she pitied, but those whom she\u000aleft behind.
p11045
aVShe added at the end of a minute,\u000a\u000a\u201cPoor old doctor,\u201d and burst into a laugh: and her heart jumped up again\u000aafter its momentary sympathetic depression, and the tears dried of\u000athemselves.
p11046
aVHer heart jumped up with a throb almost of exultation.
p11047
aVAt\u000alast she had fairly escaped--got away from the village and all the\u000aenveloping kindness and cares that had been lavished upon her.
p11048
aVJanet was not ungrateful any more than youth in the abstract is\u000aungrateful, but the first sensation of freedom had something\u000aintoxicating in it!
p11049
aVSetting out to face the world!
p11050
aVShe had been told\u000aall her life that she would have to do it some day; and though that\u000aeventuality had always been held before her as a dreadful though\u000ainevitable prospect, it had lost all its terrors as contrasted with the\u000amonotony of the village life, which she knew by heart, and all the quiet\u000aevenings and dull days in which Janet had often felt as if her young\u000aactivity and energy of mind must burst the very walls of the dainty\u000adecorous cottage where it was so happy for her, so fortunate to have\u000afound a home.
p11051
aVHow often had she felt there as if she would like to take\u000ahold of the posts as Samson did, and shake it till it toppled down about\u000aher ears, not with any ill meaning, but for sheer need of movement,\u000amischief, something to happen.
p11052
aVTo face the world!
p11053
aVShe looked it in the\u000aface with a smile of triumph and delight, as a sea-boy faces the smiling\u000aocean that is in time to be his grave, as it had been his father\u2019s\u000abefore him.
p11054
aVJanet was not afraid.
p11055
aVThe world\u2019s mine oyster.
p11056
aVHer feeling was even more\u000abuoyant than that of the young man who goes up to London to seek his\u000afortune, as being more entirely ignorant, visionary, and without\u000afoundation.
p11057
aVA young man can at least amuse himself for his day, even if\u000ahe is to be swept off upon the dark waters of ruin to-morrow; but a\u000agirl, a little governess, going to a house in St. John\u2019s Wood!
p11058
aVWhat\u000aamazing folly, what wonderful self-delusion, what a little dauntless,\u000aunforeboding, almost heroic heart!
p11059
aVthe ideal of a governess is very\u000adifferent, but Janet felt no regrets, no alarms.
p11060
aVShe was going to\u000aconquer fate.
p11061
aVWhat she would have liked would have been to have had a\u000alonger journey before her, to have travelled the whole day in order to\u000ahave been able to _savourer_ her release, her freedom, the novelty of\u000aeverything.
p11062
aVShe would have liked to arrive in her new sphere when it was\u000adark, when she could only have a mysterious glimpse of the life before\u000aher, so as to save up a sensation for the next day, which would bring a\u000afull discovery of all her surroundings.
p11063
aVBut as things were she was very\u000awell content.
p11064
aVAnd then Janet began to think what sort of a person Mrs. Harwood would\u000abe.
p11065
aVWould she be the nice sweet motherly person who sometimes in a novel\u000atook the young governess to her heart and made her feel at home at once?
p11066
aVJanet almost hoped not, for that would be too easy, too commonplace and\u000aunexciting--to go from one kind home to another, and find everything\u000amade smooth for her on every side.
p11067
aVOr would she be the purse-proud rich\u000awoman who would consider the governess as beneath her notice, with a\u000afootman who would ask \u201cAny name?\u201d as was done to Tom Pinch in\u000a\u201cChuzzlewit\u201d when he went to look after his sister.
p11068
aVFoolish Janet, in\u000athe exuberance of her life and untried power, thought it would be\u000a\u201crather fun\u201d to have to do with such a specimen of the employer.
p11069
aVShe\u000afelt with delight that she would be able to hold her own, that no person\u000aof the kind should overcome her, and that the fight would be rather\u000aexhilarating than otherwise.
p11070
aVOr would she perhaps be a fine lady, too\u000afine to be rude, who would take as little notice as possible of the\u000ayoung stranger, ignore her existence, and consider her only as a medium\u000ato grind a little knowledge into her children?
p11071
aVAll of these types Janet\u000ahad beheld in veracious fiction, which holds the mirror up to nature:\u000awhich of them should she encounter?
p11072
aVShe was not afraid of any, but the\u000aconsciousness that a battle of one kind or other would soon declare\u000aitself gave excitement to her mind and light to her eye.
p11073
aVThere were several other points in which Janet, I fear, took the vulgar\u000aand superficial view.
p11074
aVShe felt with an instinctive certainty that the\u000amen of the house, if there were any, would be on her side, and that the\u000avisitors who ought to admire the young lady of the house would probably\u000afind the governess more attractive.
p11075
aVShe had an expectation, almost going\u000athe length of a certainty, that she would be fallen in love with by two\u000aor more very eligible persons at the least, and that whenever she was\u000avisible in the room, and, most of all, if she were conspicuously\u000aneglected, the eye of \u201cthe gentlemen\u201d would pick her out, and that they\u000awould make flattering comparisons between her and the other young ladies\u000ain a happier position, and comment upon the feminine spite and jealousy\u000athat kept her in the background.
p11076
aVThis she considered to be one of the\u000arecognized certainties of her future existence, and that assurance of\u000abeing preferred and vindicated gave her a great deal of pleasure.
p11077
aVBut to\u000ado her justice this conviction did not occupy a very great part of her\u000athoughts.
p11078
aVThus Janet rattled on through all the brightest hours of the day towards\u000aher fate.
p11079
aVCHAPTER III.
p11080
aVIt was between three and four in the afternoon when Janet arrived at her\u000adestination.
p11081
aVShe knew London well enough as country young ladies know\u000ait--the parks and Belgravia, Piccadilly and the exhibitions; but St.\u000aJohn\u2019s Wood was as unknown to her as if it had been a country town in\u000athe depths of the shires.
p11082
aVShe thought it looked like a country town as\u000ashe drove along the quiet road between garden walls with trees looking\u000aover them, and stopped at the door in the wall which was all the\u000aentrance.
p11083
aVThat it had no carriage entrance was rather a trouble to the young\u000apeople in the house, but they had been used to it all their lives.
p11084
aVThe\u000adoor when it was opened showed a paved line of pathway to the house,\u000acovered by a light permanent awning, supported on slight iron pillars,\u000awhich were covered by strong climbing roses, now almost bare of leaves.
p11085
aVThe house door was also open, and showed rather a pleasant vista, for\u000athe red of the setting sun was in a long window at the back of the\u000ahouse, and lighted up an old-fashioned hall and winding staircase with a\u000awarm and comfortable light.
p11086
aVJanet had all her wits about her, though her\u000aheart was beating loudly in her ears.
p11087
aVShe noted that it was only a\u000aparlor-maid who came to the door, with momentary discouragement--but was\u000aslightly relieved when a man came round the corner of the house to take\u000aher boxes.
p11088
aVThese perceptions and variations of feeling occurred in about\u000aa minute of time, during which she paid her cabman, and turned to follow\u000athe parlor-maid into the house.
p11089
aVThe garden looked pleasant and sheltered\u000awithin its walls, and there was still a scent of late mignonette in the\u000aair of the November afternoon, though scarcely any mignonette was left\u000aat Clover.
p11090
aVJanet walked in with her firm little step, not at all bold,\u000abut neither was she abashed.
p11091
aVShe had come now to a very critical moment,\u000aand was about to have her first look at fate.
p11092
aVIf this was fate, it was not alarming.
p11093
aVThe room into which she was shown\u000awas evidently one which occupied the whole breadth of the house, though\u000ait was divided unequally by a large curtained doorway, through which,\u000awhere the curtains hung open, came the same gleam of red sunset color\u000awhich had lighted up the hall.
p11094
aVBut it was twilight in the other end to\u000awhich Janet was introduced, except for a bright circle of firelight\u000acoming from an old-fashioned high grate of glimmering steel and brass,\u000awhich threw forth the most brilliant reflections, and made all the\u000ashadows warm.
p11095
aVBy its side sat an old lady in a large chair--that is, a\u000alady whom Janet took to be very old, with white hair, a white cap, and a\u000awhite shawl over her shoulders, a very pleasing piece of light and\u000asuggested color, in the pleasant gloom.
p11096
aV\u201cIs it Miss Summerhayes?\u201d said this lady, in a soft voice, holding out\u000aher hand.
p11097
aV\u201cGussy!
p11098
aVMy dear, I am very glad to see you, though I scarcely\u000acan see you in this faint light.
p11099
aVDon\u2019t think me rude for not getting\u000aup.
p11100
aVThe fact is I can\u2019t get up, except with difficulty.
p11101
aVGussy!
p11102

aVCome near the fire, you must be\u000acold after your journey.
p11104
aVIt\u2019s grown very cold this afternoon, don\u2019t you\u000athink?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, no,\u201d said Janet, whose heart had stopped that unnecessary racket,\u000aand dropped down quite comfortably into its usual place of beating.
p11105
aV\u201cIt\u000ais not so cold at all; it looks so warm and cheerful here.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you think so, my dear?\u201d cried the old lady; \u201cindeed, I am very glad\u000ato hear you say so, and it is a pretty thing to say.
p11106
aVI fancied\u000aeverything would be dismal to you, your first coming out into the world.
p11107
aVOh, here is Gussy at last.
p11108
aVGussy, this is Miss Summerhayes.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet could not well make out the appearance of the figure which came\u000aout quickly from within the curtained doorway, and held out a hand to\u000aher.
p11109
aVThe daughter of the house was taller than herself, very slim,\u000aclothed in a dress rather too light for the season, and with hair which\u000aseemed very light also.
p11110
aVShe, too, had a soft, long hand which clasped\u000aJanet\u2019s lightly, and a soft voice, which said, \u201cI am very glad to see\u000ayou.\u201d Altogether, a more genial pleasant welcome could not have been\u000adesired.
p11111
aV\u201cMiss Summerhayes thinks it is not at all cold and that we look very\u000awarm and cheerful,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, \u201cwhich is very nice of her, and I\u000ahope she will always find us cheerful and comfortable, Gussy.
p11112
aVWhere is\u000ayour sister?
p11113
aVfor after all she must want most to see Ju.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t trouble about Ju all at once, mamma,\u201d said Miss Gussy, \u201cthere is\u000aplenty of time, and we are just going to have tea.
p11114
aVWon\u2019t you take off\u000ayour boa, Miss Summerhayes?
p11115
aVMamma\u2019s room is always too warm, I think.
p11116
aVHave you had a long journey?
p11117
aVWe could not quite make out how far it\u000awas.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOnly since twelve o\u2019clock,\u201d said Janet; \u201cit is not so very far.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGussy!
p11118
aVthe poor child can have had no proper lunch.
p11119
aVTell Priscilla to\u000abring some sandwiches with the tea.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, no, please!
p11120
aVI have had sandwiches and everything I could want.
p11121
aVI\u000acame from the kindest friends, who could never do enough for me,\u201d said\u000aJanet.
p11122
aVShe felt, and was pleased with herself for feeling, that at\u000athought of the kind vicar and his wife a little water had come into her\u000aeyes.
p11123
aV\u201cWell, that is very pleasant to know of,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood.
p11124
aV\u201cI always\u000alike to hear that people with whom I am connected have kind friends, for\u000athose who have very kind friends are generally nice themselves; and it\u000ais a great quality to be able to appreciate kindness.
p11125
aVI am sorry to hear\u000athat you are an--an orphan, Miss Summerhayes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes,\u201d said Janet, \u201cbut I must not claim too much sympathy on that\u000aaccount, for I have never known anything different.
p11126
aVI have been an\u000aorphan all my life.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, slightly checked in the flow of ready feeling.
p11127
aV\u201cBut you have lost a--a--dear relation; a--a--some one who has filled up\u000athe place?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have lost the dear lady whom I lived with always.
p11128
aVShe was my mother\u2019s\u000acousin, but she let me call her my aunt.
p11129
aVNobody could be more good.
p11130
aVI\u000ashall be grateful to her as long as ever I live,\u201d said Janet, with a\u000alittle emotion.
p11131
aV\u201cMy dear, I hope I have not recalled painful recollections; but one\u000aalways likes to know.
p11132
aVIt is very pretty what you say about this good\u000alady.
p11133
aVStill, it is not the same thing as losing your mother, and I hope\u000ayou will soon be able to look at things more cheerfully,\u201d said Mrs.\u000aHarwood, feeling that this was a little out of the regular course, and\u000anot knowing what to say.
p11134
aVThe tea had been apparently in the course of being carried in to the\u000aother end of the room while this conversation was going on, for there\u000awas a jingle of china and teaspoons, and a little movement of furniture,\u000aand a figure flitting across the opening from time to time.
p11135
aVWhen this\u000apoint had been reached a faint glow of light suddenly sprang up behind\u000athe curtains, and Gussy appeared once more.
p11136
aV\u201cAre you going through your examination, Miss Summerhayes?
p11137
aVWe all have\u000ato do it--but mamma might have let you off for a little.
p11138
aVCome into this\u000aroom and have some tea.
p11139
aVIt is not so warm here.
p11140
aVI\u2019ll bring you yours\u000adirectly, mamma.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAttend to the traveller first,\u201d said the kind old lady, and Janet\u000afollowed Gussy into the other room, where there was a lamp burning.
p11141
aVThe\u000aend of this room seemed all window, an ample bay, almost to the ground,\u000athough tempered by the shade of a veranda outside.
p11142
aVThe glow in the west\u000ahad just died away, the definite contrasted domestic light came in.
p11143
aVIn\u000athe shining of this, which was reflected in a large mirror over the\u000amantelpiece, and another opposite to it, Janet saw what Miss Harwood was\u000alike.
p11144
aVShe was very fair, hair scarcely more than flaxen, eyes blue but\u000asomewhat pale, soft features not too correct, with a little droop and\u000asway of her tall figure when she moved which was not without grace, and\u000asuggested the soft swaying of a tall flower in the air, though\u000amatter-of-fact people regarded it sometimes as a sign of weakness.
p11145
aVShe\u000adrew a chair near the tea-table for Janet, and poured out tea for her,\u000aand pressed all the good things on the table upon her acceptance--then\u000adisappeared for a moment to the other side of the curtain to take her\u000ashare of these good things to her mother.
p11146
aVJanet, with her quick ears,\u000aheard the whispered conversation between them which was only half put\u000ainto words.
p11147
aV\u201cYes, I like her\u201d--\u201cDon\u2019t make too much\u201d--\u201cYou are a nice\u000aone to say so, mamma!\u201d This last phrase was distinct enough, and Janet\u000awith a smile acknowledged its truth.
p11148
aVShe also recognized the perfect\u000ajustice of the observation, \u201cDon\u2019t make too much of her\u201d--which, of\u000acourse, was what had been said.
p11149
aVNo; it would be foolish really to make\u000atoo much of her.
p11150
aVShe felt like a young lady coming on a visit--not in\u000athe least like a little governess without friends, arriving among\u000astrangers, to a new life.
p11151
aVIf this was all which was meant by going out\u000ato seek her fortune--going out to meet her fate!
p11152
aVGussy came back and sat down and began to talk to the new-comer.
p11153
aV\u201cThis is where I always sit,\u201d she said, \u201cand where our visitors come,\u000aunless when they are mamma\u2019s great friends.
p11154
aVMamma is not very strong,\u000abut it is only right to admit that she is lazy and won\u2019t try to get up\u000aout of her chair.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt this a voice came from the other side of the curtain, slightly\u000aaffected by the fact that the mouth was full.
p11155
aV\u201cDon\u2019t forget, Gussy, that I hear every word you say.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh!
p11156
aVI know that very well, mamma.
p11157
aVShe has had rheumatism, and she is\u000astout, and she is lazy--oh, not in any other way; neither in talking,\u000anor in working, nor in thinking.
p11158
aVShe manages everything at home, and she\u000awill be quite willing to manage all your affairs if you wish it; but she\u000ais lazy about moving.
p11159
aVShe won\u2019t walk----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGussy, how unkind, when you know I _can\u2019t_!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is all a delusion, Miss Summerhayes: but we need not discuss it.
p11160
aVShe has to be wheeled about in her chair, and nothing but a visit from\u000athe Queen will make her get out of it.
p11161
aVNow we\u2019ve disposed of mamma, I\u000awon\u2019t say anything about myself, for you are forming your opinion of me\u000aall the while, as I talk.
p11162
aVI don\u2019t think I am very hard to get on with;\u000abut we must tell you, and that is the chief point of all, that the most\u000adifficult of the family is Ju.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd Ju is----?\u201d said Janet.
p11163
aV\u201cOf course your pupil.
p11164
aVShe is fourteen, and she is as obstinate as a\u000apig.
p11165
aVWe can do nothing with her, mamma and I--it is not that there is\u000aany harm in her.
p11166
aVPerhaps if we did not think so much about it things\u000awould go better; but we think, and we consult, and we compare notes, and\u000aend by worrying ourselves very much--at least mamma worries herself.
p11167
aVWe\u000ahope that some one quite new, whom she is not accustomed to, who is a\u000anovelty to her, and whom she must be civil to, will produce quite a\u000adifferent effect.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet felt a little thrill run over her at this description.
p11168
aV\u201cI hope you know,\u201d she said, somewhat faintly; \u201cI hope Mr.
p11169
aVBland told\u000ayou--that I have really no experience at all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe think that is all the better,\u201d said Gussy.
p11170
aV\u201cShe is up to all the\u000aways of the experienced people.
p11171
aVWe don\u2019t like to say anything against\u000agovernesses, but they run very much in grooves, like most other people,\u000afor that matter.
p11172
aVNow you are not professional at all; you have not got\u000ainto any of their dodges.
p11173
aVOh, don\u2019t say anything, mamma; I must use the\u000ahandiest word.
p11174
aVYou are just a girl, like any of us: I don\u2019t see how she\u000acan be nasty with you--at least not at first,\u201d said Gussy, reflectively,\u000a\u201cand by the time she is familiar enough to begin her tricks we hope you\u000awill have got an ascendancy.\u201d\u000a\u000aMiss Harwood stopped for a moment and listened.
p11175
aV\u201cHush!
p11176
aVdon\u2019t look as if we had been talking in particular; she is\u000acoming.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet did not know what to expect.
p11177
aVShe listened, thinking of the whoop\u000aand crash of some young savage; but there was nothing of the kind, and\u000ashe gave a little start in the most spontaneous manner, and rose up\u000aquickly, when Gussy said, in her soft voice:\u000a\u000a\u201cMy sister Julia--Miss Summerhayes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER IV.
p11178
aVShe was a tall girl, taller than Janet, but considerably less so than\u000aher sister, with a well-knit and active figure, clad in the shapeless\u000agarments which are considered appropriate to her age, a great mane of\u000alight brown hair falling on her shoulders, and a pair of gray eyes,\u000awhich were not soft like Gussy\u2019s, nor with any tone of blue in them; but\u000awith a glimmer of that yellow light which makes gray eyes fierce.
p11179
aVHer\u000aeyebrows were slightly puckered, giving a keen arch over her eyes, to\u000awhich this gave (when one was looking for it) a look of repression, a\u000ahint of a possible blaze and spring.
p11180
aVBut otherwise there was no sign in\u000aMiss Julia of anything out of the way or alarming.
p11181
aVShe thrust out a hot\u000ahand to Janet, said \u201cHow d\u2019ye do?\u201d because she could not help herself,\u000aaccepted without any thanks her tea from her sister, and retired at once\u000ato the background.
p11182
aVGussy gave a significant look to Janet, and elevated\u000aher eyebrows; but the new-comer saw nothing remarkable in the drawing\u000aback of the half-grown, shy girl who established herself at a table,\u000aingenuously set up an open book, which she had apparently brought in\u000awith her, so that she could read while she consumed her cake and bread\u000aand butter, and made herself comfortable in a way which Janet envied,\u000abut did not feel herself called upon to disapprove.
p11183
aVTo-morrow, perhaps,\u000awhen she was the governess in charge--but at present her mind was still\u000afree of any responsibility.
p11184
aVA certain restraint, however, seemed to fall\u000aupon the conversation after the entrance of Julia.
p11185
aVThe very monologue of\u000aGussy, the little chirp of protest from the other side of the curtain\u000adid not seem so free.
p11186
aVThey asked Janet a few questions about her\u000ajourney, which had been inconsiderable, which was absolutely so\u000aunimportant, and then it was suggested she might like to go upstairs.
p11187
aVIt was evident that the Harwoods intended to be very good to their\u000agoverness, for she found a pretty room, well furnished and warm with\u000afirelight, awaiting her--a better room than had been hers at Rose\u000aCottage, or even in the vicarage.
p11188
aV\u201cI hope you will be comfortable, and I hope you will like us,\u201d said Miss\u000aHarwood, as she left her.
p11189
aVJanet sat down in a comfortable chair by the fire.
p11190
aVShe felt very\u000acomfortable, in a state of pleasant exhilaration, but also with a faint\u000aconsciousness of having had, so to speak, the ground cut from under her\u000afeet.
p11191
aVIf this was what it was to go out governessing, what was the\u000ameaning of all the fables which she had been told from her childhood?
p11192
aVFrom _Jane Eyre_, to the _Family Herald_, they had all been in one\u000atale--there had been compensations of an exciting character, no doubt,\u000aalways, or almost always--but never a reception like this.
p11193
aVShe laughed\u000ato herself as she sat and watched the firelight dancing in the mirror\u000aover the mantelpiece, and in the dressing-glass on the table.
p11194
aVQuite as\u000anice as coming on a visit, in short, just the same, though perhaps had\u000ashe come on a visit she would not have been at once and so fully taken\u000ainto the family concerns of her hosts.
p11195
aVAt the same time there was a\u000atrifling disappointment in Janet\u2019s little soul.
p11196
aVShe had fully intended\u000ato conquer fate, to make a brilliant fight, to come out triumphant and\u000avictorious more than words could say.
p11197
aVAnd to find that there was nothing\u000ato fight about, that all was to be easy and agreeable, every authority\u000aon her side, and circumstances in her favor--took the wind out of her\u000asails, to change the metaphor.
p11198
aVIt brought a little ridicule into the\u000awhole matter.
p11199
aVTo think that she had been so screwing up her courage,\u000afortifying herself, and that her heart had beat so high, and that she\u000ahad walked into this new world with such a determined little step, as if\u000ashe were marching to military music, with her colors flying and her\u000abugle sounding, all to fall into a lap of luxury, to be received with\u000aopen arms and almost caresses at the last!
p11200
aVIn course of time, however, Janet reminded herself that instead of being\u000athe last, this after all was only the very first of her new experiences.
p11201
aVMrs. Harwood might turn out to be very different from the amiable and\u000ajocular old lady she appeared at first.
p11202
aVGussy, instead of being the\u000anicest of fair-haired girls, might develop the falseness and treachery\u000awhich some people thought went with that complexion.
p11203
aVOther complications\u000amight arise.
p11204
aVAnd then there was Ju.
p11205
aVAh!
p11206
aVJu!
p11207
aVJanet felt a little injured, wounded in her pride, when that\u000aconsideration suddenly came in and thrust itself upon her.
p11208
aVShe had\u000aanticipated a great many evils, but she had never thought that to master\u000aan unruly girl taller than herself would be the chief or the first\u000afeature of her warfare.
p11209
aVIt was almost ludicrous to think of Ju, that\u000achild, in her short petticoats and flying hair, as a synonym of fate.
p11210
aVJanet had been accustomed to be the favorite of the children wherever\u000ashe went.
p11211
aVThe little ones had always liked her, gathered about her,\u000apetitioned her to tell them stories, to sing them some of her funny\u000asongs, to make up games for them.
p11212
aVShe was famous in Clover and for quite\u000atwelve miles round for this quality.
p11213
aV\u201cDelightful with children!\u201d that\u000awas what was said of her.
p11214
aVAnd in looking forward upon the future she had\u000anever taken into account any difficulty in that respect.
p11215
aVThe\u000adifficulties she had expected had been in (perhaps) the exacting and\u000aunjust mother, (perhaps) the jealous and spiteful girl, (perhaps) the\u000aundue admiration of the male persons about, and their universal feeling\u000athat the governess was much better worth looking at and talking to than\u000athe ladies of the house.
p11216
aVThese are the difficulties chiefly set forth in novels, and, after all,\u000ait was from novels that Janet derived her chief conceptions of life.
p11217
aVBut\u000aa struggle with a wayward pupil had not occurred to her as one of her\u000apossible trials.
p11218
aVAfter all, to look at it impartially, it was a not\u000aunnatural difficulty.
p11219
aVShe ought to have considered it one of the things\u000amost likely to happen, but it was a poor unromantic difficulty with\u000anothing at all spirit-stirring in it.
p11220
aVTo wrestle in spirit with a\u000anaughty girl, to fight for obedience, for nice manners, for lessons\u000alearnt!
p11221
aVOh dear, oh dear!
p11222
aVThese were no doubt things as distinctly\u000abelonging to a governess\u2019s business as her grammar or her book of\u000amarks--but Janet had not taken them into account, and they seemed\u000adisappointing and ignoble trifles after the things for which she was\u000aprepared.
p11223
aVThe dinner was good; the table was nicely served.
p11224
aVIt was apparent that\u000athe Harwoods were not people of yesterday.
p11225
aVTheir silver was heavy and\u000aold, marked not with a crest, but with a solemn \u201cH,\u201d as a family perhaps\u000anot deeply acquainted with fantastic trophies of heraldry, but extremely\u000aconscious of the credit of their name.
p11226
aVAnd everything shone and sparkled\u000awith that nicety of good usage which is never more perceptible than in\u000athose well-to-do English houses were splendor is never aimed at.
p11227
aVMrs. Harwood was wheeled in in her chair, and, now that Janet could see\u000aher, proved to be a pretty old lady, rather different from her\u000adaughters, not, indeed, a similar type at all--a woman with lively dark\u000aeyes and warm tones of color in her complexion, and, even in her\u000acrippled condition, much more active in her movements than her eldest\u000adaughter at least.
p11228
aVThey had all dressed for dinner, according to that\u000aall-prevailing English practice which no other country knows--Gussy, in\u000aa pretty blue dress, which lent a little animation to her extreme\u000afairness; Julia, in a white frock; even Mrs. Harwood, in a changed cap\u000aand shawl.
p11229
aVHow strange it was to sit down in the midst of this\u000aunaccustomed company, amid all these unknown surroundings, in one\u2019s\u000amourning--a little black figure unlike any of them, yet one of the\u000afamily!
p11230
aVIt gave Janet once more a thrill of novel sensation that ran all\u000aover her.
p11231
aVShe sat opposite to the mirror which was over the mantelpiece\u000a(there were mirrors over all the mantelpieces), and as it was tilted\u000aforward a little Janet could see herself, which gave her much amusement\u000aand encouragement.
p11232
aVShe looked very different from all the rest in her\u000ablack frock.
p11233
aVThe second time she looked she had a vague perception that\u000acertainly she looked no worse than the rest--perhaps, better.
p11234
aVAt all\u000aevents, there is no harm in being consoled about your appearance and\u000afeeling that you are no worse than the people about you.
p11235
aVJanet felt\u000adisposed to have an occasional laugh and pleasant little remark now and\u000athen between herself and the little girl in black opposite to her in the\u000aglass.
p11236
aVSomehow she liked the looks of that little thing the best.
p11237
aVAnd the talk flowed on, all through dinner and afterwards in Mrs.\u000aHarwood\u2019s room, where they sat after dinner round the twinkling\u000afireplace, all made of shining brass and steel.
p11238
aVHow it shone and\u000atwinkled and reflected every flame, and threw off glimmers of\u000aconcentrated light!
p11239
aVThe mother was wheeled back to her usual place.
p11240
aVGussy took up her position by a screen on the other side, and Julia and\u000aMiss Summerhayes found their places between.
p11241
aVThis nomenclature had been\u000aadopted at once, to Janet\u2019s great amazement.
p11242
aVIt was as if a partnership\u000ahad been made which nobody could interfere with.
p11243
aVMrs. Harwood and her\u000aelder daughter were distinct personalities, but the other pair were Ju\u000aand Miss Summerhayes.
p11244
aV\u201cIt ought to be Miss Summerhayes and Ju,\u201d said Gussy, \u201cbut it does not\u000arun so well.
p11245
aVOne can\u2019t end off well with a ridiculous little syllable.
p11246
aVThis is where I always sit, and you must find a place according to what\u000ayou like best.
p11247
aVWe live very quietly, partly because mamma will not get\u000aout of that chair.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCan\u2019t, Gussy.
p11248
aVDon\u2019t let Miss Summerhayes form such a bad opinion of\u000ayour mother.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Summerhayes will form her own opinion quickly enough.
p11249
aVI only give\u000aher a sketch of the circumstances.
p11250
aVThis is how we are night after night,\u000aoften the whole winter through.
p11251
aVIt ought to be very dull, and it must\u000alook very dull to you, but, somehow, we are hardened, and don\u2019t feel it,\u000aexcept when Dolff is at home.
p11252
aVWhen Dolff is at home, we ought to tell\u000ayou, Miss Summerhayes, that there are sometimes a few parties--dinner\u000aparties, not very interesting, friends of the family; and on those\u000aoccasions--it is better to say it to Miss Summerhayes just at once,\u000awithout waiting till the time comes--don\u2019t you think, mamma?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Summerhayes has so much sense.
p11253
aVI am sure she will understand the\u000asize of the room and all that sort of thing,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood.
p11254
aV\u201cJust so.
p11255
aVI was sure you would think it best.
p11256
aVIt is just this, that when\u000aDolff is at home and there are dinners, sometimes we may be unable to\u000aask you to make one, Miss Summerhayes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, is that all!\u201d said Janet.
p11257
aVShe laughed with almost a little relief,\u000afor she had not known what she might be about to be told.
p11258
aV\u201cI did not\u000aexpect even to dine downstairs,\u201d she said.
p11259
aV\u201cI was told a governess never\u000adid.
p11260
aVMrs.
p11261
aVBland told me all I should have to do--to dine at two with my\u000apupil, perhaps to come in to afternoon tea, then to disappear upstairs\u000aand be seen no more.
p11262
aVThe vicar and she are saying to each other at\u000apresent: \u2018Now Janet will be feeling very lonely.
p11263
aVShe will be finding\u000aout what a solitary evening is.\u2019 Dear people!
p11264
aVI wish they could only see\u000ame now.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes,\u201d said the old lady; \u201cand all you say, my dear, about them, and\u000aabout your arrival and everything, is very pretty.
p11265
aVBut your friends were\u000areally quite right, for that is usually the case when a--young lady--is\u000ain a family in this way.
p11266
aVFor you know every family has its own\u000aways--and--and a person, a lady who is not acquainted with them may\u000abe--well, made uncomfortable, or the others may be obliged to stop\u000aspeaking with freedom when she is there.
p11267
aVIt does not matter among us,\u000awho are all ladies together--and no secrets to discuss.
p11268
aVBut\u000aoccasionally, my dear, when my son is at home, or when circumstances\u000arequire it--you won\u2019t think it means any unkindness?--but we are obliged\u000ato recur to ordinary rules--for a few days--for a little while--perhaps\u000aonly for two or three times.
p11269
aVIt is just a sort of necessity.
p11270
aVWe can\u2019t\u000ahelp ourselves.
p11271
aVI always think it easier to explain everything and set\u000aeverything on a simple footing at once.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis was a very long speech for Mrs. Harwood to make, and Janet strove\u000ato interrupt her a dozen times, to declare that she understood and that\u000ano explanations were necessary.
p11272
aVBut it came to an end at last, and the\u000aold lady pushed back her chair a little, and made a slight flourish with\u000aher handkerchief, in the satisfaction of having relieved her mind.
p11273
aVGussy\u000aimmediately took up the _parole_ without a pause.
p11274
aV\u201cYou said \u2018Janet,\u2019 Miss Summerhayes--what a nice little prepossessing\u000anatural name to have!
p11275
aVDo you know what we are called, the unfortunate\u000amembers of this family?
p11276
aVOh, I see, she can scarcely keep from laughing,\u000amamma.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI!
p11277
aVno, indeed; my name is dreadful, like a Scotch housemaid; everybody\u000asays so,\u201d said Janet, in some trouble, not knowing what was coming next.
p11278
aV\u201cWait till you know.
p11279
aVI am Augusta, which is Minerva Press of the finest\u000awater.
p11280
aVAnd that poor child is Julia, and our only brother is\u000aAdolphus--conceive such a thing!--born John if ever man was; such an\u000ahonest countenance, no pretension about it, and Adolphus put on him like\u000aa pinchbeck coronet.
p11281
aVIt is too bad.
p11282
aVMamma denies any responsibility.
p11283
aVShe\u000asays it was all my father\u2019s fault.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI say,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, \u201cthat it was the family--don\u2019t blame your\u000apoor father.
p11284
aVThe Harwoods were always queer, and it was they who liked\u000athose grand names.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou call them grand!
p11285
aVI have to sink to Gussy, and she to Ju, and Dolff,\u000apoor boy!
p11286
aVdid you ever hear a more miserable thing for a name?
p11287
aVDolff!
p11288
aVThere is nothing in it, neither meaning nor sense.
p11289
aVI know he would come\u000ahome a great deal happier if he were Jack.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat can the boy\u2019s name have to do with his happiness?\u201d cried Mrs.\u000aHarwood, testily, pushing back her chair a little more.
p11290
aV\u201cIf he were in a more exalted sphere he would be called Dolly,\u201d said his\u000asister, sadly.
p11291
aV\u201cDolly!
p11292
aVimagine, a man\u2019s name!--Now if we had been born\u000ain mamma\u2019s time we would have been Mary and Elizabeth and John--how much\u000abetter!
p11293
aVOr we might be, had mamma insisted on being in the fashion,\u000aDorothy and Mabel and Harold: not bad, though perhaps a little\u000aartificial.
p11294
aVBut Augusta, Julia, and Adolphus!
p11295
aVCan you wonder, Miss\u000aSummerhayes, that we are all sometimes on the eve of rebellion, and if\u000amamma was not really so good might be tempted even to assault her,\u000athough she declares it was not her fault?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJu,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, \u201cget up and read by the lamp.
p11296
aVThe firelight, I\u000aam always telling you, will destroy your eyes.\u201d\u000a\u000aJulia was stretched out on the carpet with a book laid out close by the\u000agleaming, dazzling fire.
p11297
aVShe had her head supported in her hands, and\u000ahad not moved or shown any sign of life while this conversation was\u000agoing on.
p11298
aVShe took not the smallest notice of what her mother said.
p11299
aV\u201cJu,\u201d said Gussy, \u201cdo you know that your hair will be ruined in that\u000aheat?
p11300
aVNurse is always complaining it is scorched off your head.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd that is why you have such dreadful headaches.
p11301
aVGet up and sit at the\u000atable beside Miss Summerhayes.
p11302
aVBut Ju neither moved nor spoke.
p11303
aVCHAPTER V.\u000a\u000a\u000aIt is one of the most curious sensations of modern life to find one\u2019s\u000aself engulfed in a new family, wrapped round and round by novel\u000acircumstances, made, momentarily, to feel as if the centre of the world\u000ahad somehow changed, and its most important features were now the\u000apeculiarities of a single race, or even of a small division of that\u000arace.
p11304
aVPeople who hurry through visit after visit, it is probable, do not\u000afeel this amusing change in the direction of all things which takes\u000aplace when an unsophisticated spirit suddenly leaves its own small\u000acentre, where the revolution of the planets has been round some\u000awell-known local or domestic sun, and plunges into another, where the\u000aforces are all the other way, and a circle of completely novel phenomena\u000acomes into sight.
p11305
aVJanet, who still felt as if she were a young lady\u000avisitor come from one star to another to discover a new life, went\u000aupstairs that evening wrapped up in Harwoodism penetrated with a new\u000aflavor, feeling these new figures of Gussy, Ju, and Dolff, Augusta,\u000aJulia and Adolphus, one of whom was as yet entirely in the mists--and\u000athe ludicrous family grievance of their names, and their unaccustomed\u000aways of living, and the blaze of firelight, and the comfort, and the\u000asober limits of their life, surrounded apparently by the garden wall,\u000aand extending no farther--to turn her round and round, absorbing her own\u000aindividuality into theirs.
p11306
aVIt seemed quite impossible to believe, when\u000ashe reached her own room, and found herself alone, that she had left a\u000atotally different world that morning, and indeed, up to half-past three\u000ain the afternoon, had never heard of Gussy, or Ju, or Dolff, or known\u000athat such persons existed.
p11307
aVJanet sat down to think it all over in her\u000acomfortable arm-chair by her blazing fire.
p11308
aVSurely there never had been\u000asuch fires.
p11309
aVHer own grate was old-fashioned, too, bright brass, which\u000areflected the flames and the glow of red-hot combustion, with which it\u000aplayed with a brilliancy which seemed to redouble the heat: the whole\u000aroom was full of the leaping light, in the midst of which two white\u000acandles burned pale, like quite unnecessary things.
p11310
aVGussy and Ju, and\u000aDolff--Dolff, Gussy, and Ju, their names made a sing-song in her head as\u000athe ruddy light darted and dazzled in her eyes.
p11311
aVIt was not even as if\u000ashe had begun to speculate on the effect upon herself and her own life\u000awhich these new surroundings would have.
p11312
aVIt was simply that she was\u000aenveloped in them, swallowed up, feeling it almost impossible to believe\u000athat there was still room in the world for Clover and such places, with\u000atheir old-fashioned interests.
p11313
aVWhen she tried to think of the vicarage,\u000ait had become like a faded old photograph to her mind--far away, at\u000aleast a year, if not an age beyond anything she could recall.
p11314
aVThe new\u000acentre of the world was in St. John\u2019s Wood.
p11315
aVAnd all the air was filled\u000awith circling reflections and echoes of Gussy, Dolff, and Ju.
p11316
aVThis rhyme was the first thing that came into her mind in the morning\u000awhen she sprang up a little confused, not quite sure where she was.
p11317
aVBut\u000aJanet was now as fresh as the morning, having shaken off her youthful\u000asuperficial fatigue, and feeling quite ready for a more reasonable view\u000aof her new surroundings.
p11318
aVThe garden upon which she looked out was\u000agetting into trim winter order, though the lawn was still liable to\u000arenewed showers of falling leaves, and the late mignonette all weedy\u000aand straggling along with long shoots of nasturtiums and heads of\u000ageraniums, disorderly with decay, were still lingering in the borders.
p11319
aVSome tall trees at the end lent a respectable background to the broad\u000abut closely-enclosed space with the very visible boundary of its brick\u000awalls.
p11320
aVIt all looked bright in the misty ruddy sunshine of the November\u000amorning.
p11321
aVThe gardener was moving about at his work, a boy after him,\u000atrundling a little wheelbarrow, with weeds and rubbish: the most\u000afamiliar sights and sounds in the hazy morning air.
p11322
aVThe new world had\u000athus some points of junction with the old, which made it look more real,\u000anot so much like a story.
p11323
aVJanet felt her heart jump to meet the new day.
p11324
aVShe was going to be exceedingly comfortable at least, and amused at\u000afirst, even if it should be a little dull after.
p11325
aVBut perhaps it would\u000anot even be dull.
p11326
aVShe herself would have something to say to that--and\u000ait is impossible to tell at twenty in what unsuspected circumstances\u000a\u201cfun\u201d may be lurking.
p11327
aVIt is one of the inextinguishable elements in life\u000aalways to be found in one corner or another.
p11328
aVJanet did not make this reflection in so many words, but she was more\u000akeenly alive to the fact than is her historian; and with this confidence\u000awent down to breakfast, when Gussy met her with all the kind greetings\u000apossible.
p11329
aVThe breakfast-table was quite brilliant to behold, with a\u000asilver tea-urn of old-fashioned form, silver tea-pot, coffee-pot, a\u000aglitter of silver everywhere: and so well kept!
p11330
aVand so heavy and\u000arespectable!
p11331
aVwith such an air of sober, modest, consciously\u000aundemonstrative comfort and wealth!
p11332
aVGussy\u2019s dress was still too light for Janet\u2019s taste, being an\u000aexceedingly pale gray, which was not very becoming to a person with so\u000alittle color; but she looked as _nice_, and purled forth her soft\u000aspeeches just as on the night before.
p11333
aVOne thing she said, however, which\u000awas of more importance than all these friendly purlings, gave Janet the\u000afirst touch of the real in this mild domestic elysium.
p11334
aVShe put out her\u000along soft hand from behind the urn, and laid it on Janet\u2019s arm.
p11335
aV\u201cBefore she appears, just one word, Miss Summerhayes.
p11336
aVPlease strike your\u000ablow at once.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat blow?\u201d asked Janet, amazed.
p11337
aV\u201cTo get the upper hand of Ju.
p11338
aVYou are quite a novelty; she does not know\u000ayou at all.
p11339
aVYou might startle her into submitting, if you took advantage\u000aof the circumstances.
p11340
aVDon\u2019t ask anything unreasonable of her, but never\u000agive in when you have insisted on anything.
p11341
aVDon\u2019t let her beat you.
p11342
aVShe\u2019s coming down now; I can\u2019t say any more.
p11343
aVAnd there\u2019s really no more\u000ato say.
p11344
aVNever let her win the day.\u201d\u000a\u000aThese words tingling in her ears gave Janet the strangest little shock,\u000alike the sudden touch of an electric battery, in the midst of the\u000acomfort and quiet.
p11345
aVShe could scarcely keep from jumping up, starting out\u000aof her seat.
p11346
aVHer black sleeve, when Gussy took her long fingers from it,\u000aseemed to give out sparks.
p11347
aVTo strike a blow, to win a battle, never to\u000aallow herself to be beat.
p11348
aVWhat curious words in this absolutely quiet\u000aand ordinary domestic calm?
p11349
aVJu came in with a nod to Miss Summerhayes, and said nothing at all while\u000ashe despatched her breakfast.
p11350
aVBut then Gussy was talking all the time,\u000aand there was not much room for anyone else.
p11351
aVShe was certainly a most\u000aself-absorbed young person; but, save her silence and that acute small\u000acurve over each eyebrow, caused by a sort of permanent frown, there\u000aseemed nothing else to alarm a stranger.
p11352
aVJanet\u2019s heart still beat more quickly than before, but she gradually got\u000amore calm, and assured herself there could be no real danger.
p11353
aVIn some\u000afamilies all the molehills are made into mountains, and perhaps that was\u000athe case here.
p11354
aVIt was with a little excitement, however, that Janet walked into the\u000aschool-room, which she found communicated with her own room by a short\u000apassage, and which occupied a corner of the house with one window to the\u000agarden and another in the other wall, from which a view could be\u000aobtained into the outer world, meaning in this case the exceedingly\u000aquiet suburban road between two lines of garden walls which had reminded\u000aJanet of a country town.
p11355
aVThe young governess of twenty came into this\u000aroom, which was still in the shadow, though expectant of a gleam of\u000asunshine from the south when the sun should have made a little more\u000aprogress, with some excitement, of which, however, she was able to\u000aconceal the signs.
p11356
aVIt gave a brightness to her eyes and a little thrill\u000ato her upper lip, but that was all.
p11357
aVShe had not the least idea of what\u000ashe was going to encounter.
p11358
aVThe young knight in the story of the\u000aSleeping Beauty was not more ignorant, nor was she at all sure that she\u000aknew how to fight, or had the coolness and the courage necessary for an\u000aimportant encounter.
p11359
aVWith a child of fourteen!
p11360
aVshe tried to say to\u000aherself with a laugh.
p11361
aVBut, after all, twenty is not so very far elevated\u000aover fourteen, and the child was taller and almost more developed than\u000athe woman.
p11362
aVIt was at ten o\u2019clock that lessons were to begin, and at ten\u000aminutes to ten Janet opened the school-room door.
p11363
aVMystery and\u000aexpectation made her heart beat.
p11364
aVShe stepped in once more, feeling the\u000athrill as of an electric machine; and her breathing was slightly\u000aaffected, though she would not show it.
p11365
aVShe had almost feared she would\u000afind emptiness, which would have been the most embarrassing of all, for\u000ahow fight when your opponent does not show?
p11366
aVBut, fortunately, Julia was\u000aalready there.
p11367
aVThis was what Janet found: a table set out in the middle\u000aof the room, with books and writing things, all in good order; the piano\u000aopen at the back, with music upon it.
p11368
aVMeanwhile, at the south window,\u000aseated at another table, with both her elbows resting upon it as if\u000ariveted to the mahogany--Julia, her head supported on her hands, a book\u000alying open before her, in precisely the same attitude in which she had\u000alain on the previous night scorching her head in the heat and blaze of\u000athe fire.
p11369
aVJanet stood for a moment looking at her pupil with an internal shiver.
p11370
aVHer pupil--to whom she was not at all sure of being able to teach\u000aanything--whom in any circumstances she would have felt an alarmed\u000arespect for, as a being probably destined to find her out, and expose\u000aher little pretences.
p11371
aVJulia remained like a statue, immovable, not\u000aturning to see who had come in according to weak mortal usage, far too\u000astrong in the instincts of rebellion and individuality for any such\u000abetrayal of weakness.
p11372
aVMiss Summerhayes then moved a little about the\u000aroom--looked at the music, took up the books on the table, glanced out\u000afrom the window.
p11373
aVTen o\u2019clock had not yet struck.
p11374
aVShe finally went and\u000aseated herself in the chair placed for her, and waited until the ten\u000atiny strokes, tingling from the clock on the mantelpiece, had been\u000aanswered by all the church towers in the neighborhood.
p11375
aVThen there came\u000aan awful moment.
p11376
aV\u201cJulia, it is time for lessons.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet heard her own voice falter, but the tremor was not audible to any\u000alistener.
p11377
aVJulia did not move nor reply.
p11378
aV\u201cI am waiting to begin lessons,\u201d Janet repeated more sharply, after a\u000amoment.
p11379
aVDead silence--not by the merest quiver of movement did Julia betray that\u000ashe had heard.
p11380
aV\u201cIt is ten o\u2019clock, and I am waiting to begin lessons.
p11381
aVJulia!\u201d\u000a\u000aJulia sat like a figure of wood or stone.
p11382
aVMiss Janet Summerhayes rose from her chair, pale, with her eyes shining.
p11383
aVHer little temper came to her aid.
p11384
aVThe fun disappeared.
p11385
aVThe moment of\u000aconflict had come.
p11386
aVCHAPTER VI.
p11387
aVJanet had as pretty a little temper of her own as you could meet\u000aanywhere.
p11388
aVIt flashed up in a moment into her eyes.
p11389
aVNo one, schoolgirl or\u000aotherwise, was likely to get a cheap bargain of this little governess.
p11390
aVShe rose, and, turning the key in the door as she passed, walked up to\u000athe table at which Miss Julia sat with her book.
p11391
aVThe girl was not aware\u000athat her own absolute immovability proved to her antagonist that she was\u000anot absorbed in her book but in the battle which had begun.
p11392
aVMiss\u000aSummerhayes stood opposite to her for a moment looking down upon Julia\u2019s\u000abent head.
p11393
aVShe felt the key of the door in her pocket, which, perhaps,\u000awas rather a desperate step so early in the fight; as in doing this she\u000ahad at once burnt her ships, and committed herself to a policy of\u000aabsolute no-surrender; but still it inspired her, for she could now\u000aneither draw back nor temporize.
p11394
aV\u201cJulia!
p11395
aVI have told you three times that it is ten o\u2019clock, and I am\u000awaiting to begin lessons.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere was still not a movement, not a sound.
p11396
aVJulia sat as if made of\u000astone.
p11397
aVThen Janet made the great _coup_ she had been contemplating.
p11398
aVWith\u000aa sudden swift movement she took the book from under the reader\u2019s bent\u000aface, closed it, and carried it away.
p11399
aVIn a moment Julia was erect,\u000agetting to her feet with a bound, her gray eyes dilating into great\u000aglobes of gold, her spring like that of a tiger.
p11400
aVJanet had scarcely\u000atime, though her movements were very quick, to get back to the shelter\u000aof her arm-chair.
p11401
aVBut she managed to do so, and to lock up the offending\u000avolume in a drawer, with Julia\u2019s grip on her shoulder, and a shriek of\u000a\u201cHow dare you, how dare you!\u201d ringing in her ears.
p11402
aV\u201cMiss Summerhayes!
p11403
aVgive me back my book.
p11404
aVHow dare you take my book?
p11405
aVGive\u000ait me this moment--do you hear me!
p11406
aVdo you hear me!\u201d cried the girl,\u000apassionately, holding Janet\u2019s shoulders in a grasp of steel.
p11407
aV\u201cI hear you perfectly well--as you heard me just now.
p11408
aVTake your hands\u000afrom my shoulders.
p11409
aVI did not touch you; if we are to fight, let us fight\u000afair.\u201d\u000a\u000aJulia\u2019s hands dropped, and a shade of consternation came over her eyes.
p11410
aVThen she stamped her foot violently upon the floor--\u201cMiss Summerhayes,\u000agive me back my book?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSit down,\u201d said Janet, not uncheerfully, \u201cand we can have it out.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGive me back my book!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell,\u201d said Janet, \u201cnow we have both got through that formula, _trois\u000asommations_--though I am afraid not very _respectueuses_.
p11411
aVDo you know\u000awhat that means?
p11412
aVI called you three times and you have called me three\u000atimes.
p11413
aVWe are equal, so far.
p11414
aVNow sit down and let us talk it out.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cEqual!\u201d said Julia, with a shriek, \u201cme and you, Miss Summerhayes!
p11415
aVYou\u000aare only the governess--that\u2019s no better than a servant.
p11416
aVYou may suppose\u000athey think different downstairs, because of their way of talking, and\u000abecause Gussy thinks it\u2019s grand to be like that.
p11417
aVBut they think just the\u000asame.
p11418
aVAnd mamma will stand up for me.
p11419
aVShe pretends she wants me to be\u000amastered, but she doesn\u2019t, and you\u2019ll find the difference when you go to\u000aher with your complaints.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut I don\u2019t mean to go to her with any complaints,\u201d said Janet, putting\u000aon the best smile she could.
p11420
aV\u201cIf we are to get on, we must manage it\u000abetween ourselves; if not, there is a very easy remedy for me.
p11421
aVYou had\u000abetter sit down, and discuss the matter, so that we may know what we are\u000aabout.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat\u2019s your remedy?\u201d cried Julia, breathing hard.
p11422
aV\u201cIt will be quite effectual, as far as I am concerned: but I don\u2019t like\u000ato be beaten, so I shall try some others first.
p11423
aVSit down there.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI shan\u2019t,\u201d Miss Julia said.
p11424
aV\u201cWell, stand on your head then,\u201d said Janet, \u201cperhaps you may like that\u000abetter: only let us get all the necessary tricks over, and come to\u000abusiness, for it may as well be decided once for all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow dare you talk of tricks!
p11425
aVWhat do you call my tricks?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey are quite easy to describe.
p11426
aVTo pretend to be deaf, dumb, and\u000ablind; to pretend to be a wild beast; to shriek and snort and talk loud.
p11427
aVI don\u2019t know what others you may still have to get through, but you must\u000aknow as well as I do that all these are tricks, and of no consequence.
p11428
aVWhen they are exhausted, then we can begin to talk.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMe a wild beast!
p11429
aVMe of no consequence!
p11430
aVI should like,\u201d cried Julia,\u000awith her eyes blazing like red-hot flames, and her fingers clasping and\u000aunclasping, \u201cjust to give it you hot, for once!
p11431
aVjust to stamp upon you,\u000aand tear off your fal-lals and pitch you out of the window!\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet nodded her head at each threat, not by way of approbation, but of\u000aacquiescence as in an argument she had foreseen.
p11432
aV\u201cI know,\u201d she said, \u201cI told you so.
p11433
aVIt would be a great saving of time\u000aif you would consider all that sort of thing as said, and come to the\u000areal question.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is the real question?\u201d said Julia, staring, with her hands\u000agrasping the top of the chair on which she had been requested to sit\u000adown--whether because she was checked in her childish rage, or whether\u000abecause she meant to use it as a weapon, it was difficult to say.
p11434
aV\u201cThe real question is, whether we are to be able to get on together or\u000anot.
p11435
aVIt\u2019s the only one of any importance.
p11436
aVI want to come to that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat an awful fool you must be,\u201d said Julia, bending over the back of\u000athe chair towards Janet with flaming looks of wrath.
p11437
aV\u201cYes,\u201d said Janet.
p11438
aV\u201cOne of us is so, that is very evident: but why\u000ashould it strike you at this moment?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo think that it isn\u2019t settled already, to think I would ever give in\u000ato you for a moment.
p11439
aVKnuckle under!
p11440
aVme!
p11441
aVOh!
p11442
aVyou think you can come over\u000ame with smiling, when you are in as blue a funk---- You, a bit of a\u000agoverness hired just like the housemaid: and that\u2019s exactly what mamma\u000awill say.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet yawned a little in the girl\u2019s furious face, a gentle little yawn\u000awhich did not at all distort her own countenance.
p11443
aV\u201cMy poor child,\u201d she said, \u201cif you would only consider that I understand\u000aall that, and that we\u2019d so much better come to business!
p11444
aVYou can\u2019t\u000afrighten me, and though, of course, you can insult me, that\u2019s of equally\u000alittle use, for I don\u2019t care.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBecause you\u2019re used to it,\u201d cried Julia.
p11445
aV\u201cNo--once only before.
p11446
aVIt was a tramp on the road, an old woman, and I\u000awould not give her any money.
p11447
aVIt is curious to think where you can have\u000alearned the same sort of thing--brought up, I suppose, more or less like\u000aa lady--but it must be in the blood.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you mean to say I\u2019m not a lady--you--?
p11448
aVOh-h!\u201d for Janet had gently\u000ashrugged those little shoulders which still felt the young fury\u2019s grip.
p11449
aV\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d cried Julia, fiercely, \u201cI\u2019ll go this moment and tell mamma.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet sat quietly in her chair awaiting the discovery of the locked\u000adoor, and somewhat alarmed lest there should ensue a physical struggle\u000awhich would be undignified and unladylike.
p11450
aVThen followed a whirlwind of\u000anoise, stamping, shrieking, and wild talk.
p11451
aV\u201cGive me the key!
p11452
aVOpen the door!
p11453
aVI want to go to mamma.
p11454
aVMamma!
p11455
aVLet me\u000aout.
p11456
aVLet me out!
p11457
aVI want to open the door,\u201d--then a furious kick upon the\u000apanel.
p11458
aV\u201cMamma!
p11459
aVGussy!
p11460
aVI\u2019m locked in; come, come, and open the door.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is a pity that all the servants should know you are in trouble,\u000aJulia.
p11461
aVLet it remain between you and me,\u201d said Janet, laying her hand\u000aupon the girl\u2019s shoulder.
p11462
aV\u201cOpen the door!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, I shall not open the door--nor shall anyone else, if I can help it.
p11463
aVLet this remain between you and me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMamma will send and order you to do it.
p11464
aVMamma!
p11465
aVmamma!
p11466
aVI am locked in.
p11467
aVI\u000acan\u2019t get out.
p11468
aVCome and open the door!\u201d\u000a\u000aHow it was that no one heard these outcries Janet could not imagine: but\u000athey were at the top of the house: the kitchen was thoroughly occupied\u000awith its own affairs, and Mrs. Harwood, as she found out afterwards, had\u000abeen wheeled out for her morning airing, so that silence alone replied\u000ato Julia\u2019s passionate appeals.
p11469
aVShe rushed to the window and flung it\u000aopen, but the gardener was not visible in the garden.
p11470
aVAfter half-an-hour\u000aof tumult, an enforced silence fell upon the school-room.
p11471
aVBut Julia was\u000anot yet overcome.
p11472
aV\u201cI shall keep you here all your life--you shan\u2019t go--not a step.
p11473
aVIf I am\u000ato be shut in, you shall be shut in too.
p11474
aVYou shall have no lunch; you\u000ashall have no tea; you shall have no dinner!\u201d said Julia, _crescendo_,\u000arising to a climax.
p11475
aV\u201cWell,\u201d said Janet, \u201cif you think it better to put off our conversation\u000atill to-morrow, I make no objection.
p11476
aVIt will be very uncomfortable--but\u000athere are worse things than discomfort in this world.
p11477
aVI have done\u000awithout my dinner before now.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes!
p11478
aVoften, I shouldn\u2019t wonder--when you had nobody to give you a\u000adinner,\u201d cried Julia.
p11479
aVJanet looked at the furious girl with a glance of astonishment in her\u000aeyes.
p11480
aVShe laughed a little.
p11481
aV\u201cYou silly child,\u201d she said.
p11482
aVAnd then in the midst of the agitation and tumult there occurred a\u000amoment of quiet.
p11483
aVJulia was at the end of her resources.
p11484
aVShe was worn out\u000awith her own passion, dismayed by being thus left to the tender mercies\u000aof the governess, and discouraged beyond description by the indifference\u000aand contempt of the stranger whom she had been so certain of subduing--a\u000alittle thing not so big as herself, a little governess without a\u000afriend--a subject creature whom it was safe for everybody to jump upon.
p11485
aVJulia\u2019s experience contained no stronger picture of the governess than\u000athat of the one who ran away next morning after complaining to Mrs.\u000aHarwood that she was not accustomed to such young ladies.
p11486
aVThe others had\u000aall coaxed and cringed and endeavored to temporize.
p11487
aVJulia went and sat down panting at the other table, and watched this new\u000akind of human being seated in the middle of the room as if nothing had\u000ahappened, calmly writing, not a hair turned upon her head, not a bit of\u000afrill crumpled about her neck.
p11488
aVIt was natural to Janet to be neat, and\u000aher self-control was wonderful.
p11489
aVBesides, of course she knew that she was\u000abeing looked at, watched with all the keen observation of a vindictive\u000achild to see where her weakness lay.
p11490
aVThat she had supported this\u000astruggle so long without moments of weakness it would be vain to\u000asay--that she had not felt the stings and resented the blows.
p11491
aVHer heart\u000ahad beat as if it was bursting from her breast.
p11492
aVShe had felt herself\u000atrembling all over with excitement and alarm.
p11493
aVBut she had managed\u000asomehow to keep calm all along, and she was still calm now, keeping in\u000aher breath, holding herself with all her might to look indifferent.
p11494
aVJulia\u2019s observation was keen, but not so keen as to pierce Janet\u2019s\u000aarmour of mail.
p11495
aVThe girl sat staring at her with eyes that became less\u000aand less like orbs of flame, and more like ordinary big gray eyes with a\u000agolden glow.
p11496
aVAnd Janet wrote a letter.
p11497
aVIt was the only thing she could\u000athink of to give her the support of an occupation.
p11498
aVShe wrote a narrative\u000aof what had passed, writing \u201cDear Mrs. Bland\u201d at the top to give herself\u000aa countenance, though the last thing in the world she would have done\u000awas to send the vicar\u2019s wife such a description of her first day in her\u000anew situation.
p11499
aVShe smiled, however, to herself involuntarily as she went\u000aon with her story, making it very amusing.
p11500
aVAnd Julia saw her smile, and\u000asomething like awe came over the exhausted spirit of the little rebel.
p11501
aVTo go through all that, one tithe of which would have broken the spirit\u000aof any other governess, and yet to smile!
p11502
aVAfter a long interval of silence, and when Janet began to wonder with\u000asome alarm how she would meet a long strain of passive resistance had\u000aJulia strength of mind to keep it up, a sudden voice once more made\u000aitself heard.
p11503
aV\u201cMiss Summerhayes!
p11504
aVthe first thing I shall do when I get out of this\u000awill be to tell mamma.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is exactly what I should recommend,\u201d said Janet, looking up from\u000aher writing; \u201cone\u2019s mother should always know everything,\u201d and with a\u000alittle friendly nod she returned to her letter.
p11505
aVJulia could not tell what to think: there was more in it than her\u000apuzzled understanding had ever encountered before.
p11506
aVAfter a while she\u000asaid, with some hesitation, \u201cMiss Summerhayes!\u201d again.
p11507
aV\u201cYes,\u201d said Janet, looking up once more.
p11508
aV\u201cWhat did you mean about conversation?
p11509
aVI hate you!
p11510
aVI shall never speak\u000ato you three words if I can help it; but what did you mean about putting\u000aoff the conversation?
p11511
aVI want to know----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPerhaps it will be better to put it off till to-morrow.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI want to have it now.
p11512
aVConversation!
p11513
aVas if there ever could be any\u000abetween you and me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is what I have just said.
p11514
aVIt will be better to put it off,\u201d said\u000aJanet, without raising her head, turning over the page of her supposed\u000aletter.
p11515
aVThe next thing she heard was a stamp on the floor, suppressed so that it\u000awas scarcely a stamp, and an exclamation,\u000a\u000a\u201cI prefer to have it now.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI cannot talk to anyone so far off,\u201d said Janet, and there was another\u000apause.
p11516
aVPresently she could hear the faint rustling of a person about to get up\u000afrom a chair, which went on for some time, there being an evident and\u000agreat reluctance to move.
p11517
aVThen there was a sudden plunge.
p11518
aVJulia alighted\u000aopposite her, on the other side of the table.
p11519
aV\u201cI want to know what it is---- I want to know what you want with me.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet sat up, raised her head, putting down her pen.
p11520
aV\u201cHonestly, and without any more preliminaries?\u201d she said.
p11521
aVJulia\u2019s eyes gave a single dart of fire.
p11522
aV\u201cNo one ever said I was a thief.
p11523
aVI want to know what you want with me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is what I call honestly,\u201d Janet replied, and she put away her\u000awriting things for the second encounter, the first having thus been\u000asuccessful beyond her hopes.
p11524
aVCHAPTER VII.
p11525
aV\u201cWell,\u201d said Janet, when she found herself looking into the blurred and\u000aflushed countenance of the passionate girl.
p11526
aVJulia had given vent, in\u000aspite of herself, to some tears, and had dashed them away with her hand\u000aor her sleeve, leaving a smear, and her hair was hanging wildly round\u000aher face, and there was a general air of dilapidation and ruin, though\u000aaccompanied by few actual signs of warfare.
p11527
aVShe ought to have torn her\u000afrock from top to bottom to justify the general aspect of affairs, but\u000ashe had not done so, and the smeared cheek and the ragged hair were the\u000aonly physical certainties of the conflict past.
p11528
aVThere was still a pucker\u000aover each eye, but it was not an assured and dauntless pucker.
p11529
aVThe\u000afortunes of war, for once, had not turned the usual way.
p11530
aV\u201cWell--you have been behaving like a fool, but a fool has no meaning.
p11531
aVWhen one can behave like a fool with a meaning I think there must be\u000asome sense at the bottom.
p11532
aVIf I am right, nothing matters that has\u000ahappened; but if I am wrong----\u201d\u000a\u000aJulia stared with faint comprehension and much impatience.
p11533
aVShe said--\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t palaver.
p11534
aVWhat do you want with me?\u201d\u000a\u000aNow, Janet had expected to exercise a little feminine philosophy upon\u000athe girl when she had got her in hand--a little banter, a little\u000aseriousness--to make her ashamed of herself in the first place, and then\u000ato make her see.
p11535
aVShe was taken a little aback.
p11536
aVIf she could not make her\u000aashamed nor make her see, what was to be done?
p11537
aVThe question grew a great\u000adeal more serious thus than when it concerned only a locked door.
p11538
aVShe\u000aran over the circumstances rapidly in her mind, and she saw it would not\u000ado to answer according as it at first occurred to her, that she (Janet)\u000apersonally wanted nothing at all with Julia, except as little to do with\u000aher as might be.
p11539
aV\u201cWhat I want is simple,\u201d she said, with a smile.
p11540
aV\u201cI want to do the work\u000aI have been engaged to do, and that is to educate you for as many hours\u000aas your mother has fixed for your education.
p11541
aVHow am I to get that done?
p11542
aVfor, you may be sure, I mean to do it one way or other.
p11543
aVI want to talk\u000ait over and discover how it is to be done.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t want it to be done at all\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNeither do I,\u201d said Janet, facing the rebel bravely, and bursting into\u000aa laugh.
p11544
aV\u201cBut if you will reflect,\u201d she said, \u201cthat does not get us a\u000abit further on, for it must be done.
p11545
aVUnless it is done you will grow up\u000alike the tramp woman I was telling you of--not at all an interesting\u000aperson--and I shall break my word.
p11546
aVNow, I don\u2019t like to break my word.
p11547
aVYou don\u2019t care at present about becoming like a tramp, but you will\u000alater on.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow dare you say----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJulia,\u201d said the little governess, \u201cI dare to say anything I think\u000aproper, or to do anything, so you had better make up your mind to that\u000aat once.
p11548
aVSuch questions are silly.
p11549
aVI am not afraid of anyone or\u000aanything.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet threw back her head, which was smaller--as she was smaller in\u000aevery part--than that of her tall pupil.
p11550
aVThere is nothing so fearless in\u000alife as a girl who is without fear.
p11551
aVIt is true that the kind of\u000adauntless courage she possesses is largely made up of ignorance, and\u000aalso comes a little perhaps from the conventional precautions which\u000adefend her, though she does not know it.
p11552
aVHowever, the quality is\u000aabsolute, and Janet had it.
p11553
aVShe feared nothing, as she said.
p11554
aVJulia, from under her puckered eyebrows, glared into the clear brown\u000aeyes, which had something in them like the sparkle of a Highland stream,\u000aand admired the valor which she did not possess: for she was afraid of\u000athe coercion which she was always fighting against.
p11555
aVShe stared, but she\u000asaid nothing in reply.
p11556
aV\u201cYou see,\u201d said Janet, \u201cI will do what I\u2019ve promised: and if I were you\u000aI\u2019d say I will too.
p11557
aVIt\u2019s much nicer than to have to say I must----\u201d\u000a\u000aStill Julia stared; her lips moved as if she would have spoken, but she\u000auttered no sound.
p11558
aV\u201cDownstairs,\u201d said Janet, \u201cthey expect us to fight.
p11559
aVI am afraid you have\u000abeen so silly that they think you are a fool, and don\u2019t understand\u000aanything about what is expected from a gentlewoman.
p11560
aVThat\u2019s not my\u000aopinion, as I told you: but as I shall not give in, whatever you do, it\u000awould be very silly to go on fighting forever.
p11561
aVWe can make something\u000abetter of it: if you will be convinced that I never shall be afraid of\u000ayou--no, nor of anyone else,\u201d Janet repeated, with the color mounting in\u000aher cheeks.
p11562
aVJulia continued silent for some time; then, with a sudden burst of harsh\u000asound, asked, \u201cWhat do you want of me?\u201d and was abruptly silent again,\u000aas if a spring had been touched to give forth that voice.
p11563
aV\u201cI want you to speak when you are spoken to,\u201d said Janet.
p11564
aVThe girl, who evidently expected something of much larger scope, cried\u000a\u201cOh!\u201d but said no more.
p11565
aV\u201cI want you to do as I tell you--for so many hours in the day--from ten\u000ato one, is it?
p11566
aVThat\u2019s not very long.
p11567
aVYou can be a demon after that, if\u000ayou please, and dance your war-dance.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat do you mean by--dancing my war-dance?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBehaving like a fiend, or a Red Indian, or a tramp in the roads: so\u000along as you are in your senses from ten to one.\u201d\u000a\u000aJulia stared again, but made no reply.
p11568
aV\u201cBut you must remember,\u201d said Janet, \u201cthat in the place I come from,\u000awhere there are no Red Indians, there is a point of honor; and whatever\u000aone undertakes to do one does.
p11569
aVIf you see the sense of what I say, and\u000agive me your word, it is once and forever; not promise one day and break\u000ait the next.
p11570
aVThat is a sort of thing I don\u2019t understand.
p11571
aVOne promises,\u000aand it is for life and death.
p11572
aVIt does not matter what comes in the way.
p11573
aVIf you were to be killed for it, it would have to be done.\u201d\u000a\u000aJulia stared for a few moments more, and then----\u000a\u000a\u201cI can see the sense of that,\u201d she said.
p11574
aV\u201cTo be sure.
p11575
aVI knew you would when you gave yourself time to look at it.
p11576
aVWell, then, you can see that to call in other people or other\u000aconsiderations is of no use between you and me.
p11577
aVAt the last we should\u000aalways have to talk it over between ourselves.
p11578
aVIf you like, you can make\u000ait quite easy and rather pleasant; if you don\u2019t, I must think of some\u000aother way.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen the hour of luncheon arrived, the respectable household in St.\u000aJohn\u2019s Wood was considerably excited as to the fate of the new\u000agoverness.
p11579
aVPerhaps the servants had not been so completely out of\u000ahearing as had appeared.
p11580
aVPerhaps some stray notes of the fray had been\u000ablown out of the open windows or conveyed through the chinks of the\u000awoodwork.
p11581
aVAt all events, there was a prevailing curiosity in the house,\u000awhich became apparent almost as soon as the governess and her pupil left\u000athe shelter of those rooms in which already so many varied scenes in the\u000alife and education of Julia Harwood had taken place.
p11582
aVMrs. Harwood\u2019s maid\u000amet them on the stairs, and gave Janet an inquiring look, to which the\u000agoverness, you may be sure, made no reply.
p11583
aVHalf-way down they were again\u000amet by the parlor-maid, who, looking somewhat \u201cflustered,\u201d announced\u000athat Mrs. Harwood was afraid they might not have heard the bell.
p11584
aV\u201cOh, yes, we can hear the bell perfectly,\u201d said Janet.
p11585
aVShe went into the dining-room with Julia so close behind her that they\u000aformed one shadow.
p11586
aVMrs. Harwood\u2019s face was turned anxiously towards the\u000adoor.
p11587
aVGussy, more astute, had her eyes intent upon the mirror, in which\u000aeverything was reflected.
p11588
aVThere was a long breath of relief drawn by\u000aboth, not, perhaps, audible by any uninterested spectator, but affecting\u000athe entire atmosphere to Janet\u2019s excited consciousness.
p11589
aVShe felt as if\u000aher triumph must be of more importance than the mere victory over a\u000anaughty child, and wondered, with a passing thrill, was there any\u000amystery involved?
p11590
aVBut in face of the decorous, gentle household, so\u000acorrect, so punctilious, which had not a fold awry, or a corner\u000aneglected in all its careful economy, it was ludicrous to think of any\u000amystery.
p11591
aVHowever, there could be no doubt that her entrance was greeted\u000awith extreme pleasure.
p11592
aV\u201cSit here, my dear Miss Summerhayes,\u201d said the mistress of the house.
p11593
aV\u201cThis is the warm corner; there is no draught at this side.
p11594
aVWell, you\u000ahave got over your first morning\u2019s work.
p11595
aVAnd how do you like teaching?
p11596
aVIt\u2019s very tedious, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, not where there is intelligence and brains,\u201d said Janet, with great\u000acomposure.
p11597
aV\u201cChildren who cannot keep up their attention are very trying;\u000abut not anyone who is old enough to understand.
p11598
aVThere has not been much\u000ateaching, however, this morning, we have been chiefly talking things\u000aover.
p11599
aVTwo strangers forced together without any mutual knowledge, I\u000athought it best that we should understand each other first.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis statement, which was given with the most natural air in the world,\u000awas listened to by all her audience with the most flattering interest,\u000abut perfect decorum, the only transgressor of which was the parlor-maid,\u000afrom whose direction there came one or two faint muffled sounds, whether\u000aof painfully suppressed laughter, or of something giving way in the\u000aeffort of controlling emotion, Janet could not tell.
p11600
aVGussy fixed the\u000aculprit with a glittering eye from behind the screen which sheltered her\u000afrom the blazing fire, and Mrs. Harwood cast a cursory glance behind\u000aher.
p11601
aVNone of these things would have been noticed at all by a stranger\u000awho was less prepared than Janet, but she perceived everything in her\u000aown suppressed excitement.
p11602
aVThere was something amusing, however, in the\u000acomment made by the strain upon the parlor-maid\u2019s stays.
p11603
aV\u201cThat is so sensible,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, \u201cit is for want of getting to\u000aunderstand each other that so many relationships go wrong.
p11604
aVJu, push your\u000achair back a little, the sun is in your face.\u201d\u000a\u000aJulia paid no attention to this command.
p11605
aV\u201cJu, the sun is in your face, sit nearer this way; your eye-sight will\u000abe gone before you are twenty.
p11606
aVChild, do you hear me!\u201d Mrs. Harwood\u000acried.
p11607
aV\u201cAnd her complexion: you will have none at all left, not a tint,\u201d said\u000aGussy, \u201cbefore you come out.\u201d\u000a\u000aJulia did not betray by a movement that she had heard either speak, but\u000aput her head forward into a brilliant ray of sunshine which streamed\u000aacross the table, so as to get the full glow upon her face.
p11608
aVShe had not\u000amuch to boast of in the way of complexion.
p11609
aVWhether it was the blaze of\u000asunlight and firelight combined to which she loved to expose herself, or\u000awhether it was nature, her face thus brought into prominence was sallow\u000aand freckled, only relieved by the golden light in her gray eyes.
p11610
aV\u201cThe winter sun cannot do much harm,\u201d said Janet, with a friendly\u000aimpulse.
p11611
aV\u201cIt makes a pretty picture.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh,\u201d said Gussy, shaking her head, \u201cyou should have seen that child\u000aonce; she had such a color.
p11612
aVWe have nothing to brag of in the way of\u000acomplexion in our family, but I once thought Ju would redeem us in that\u000arespect.
p11613
aVAlas!\u201d and Miss Harwood shook her head.
p11614
aV\u201cAnd did you find her very backward, Miss Summerhayes?
p11615
aVand is there any\u000aspecial thing you think she is more fit for than others?
p11616
aVI always like\u000ayoung people to have some particular turn.
p11617
aVDo you remember, Gussy, how\u000awe used to try and try with Dolff to get him to say what he would like\u000ato be.
p11618
aVBut he never would take an attitude of his own.
p11619
aV\u2018Whatever you\u000aplease, mother,\u2019 he used to say.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat was all his goodness, mamma,\u201d said Gussy.
p11620
aV\u201cWhat he wanted was\u000atravel and that sort of thing--and he knew you would not like it.
p11621
aVWe\u000ahave never travelled much in this family.
p11622
aVAnd then he knew he would not\u000aon any great occasion have to work for himself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe never can tell that,\u201d said the old lady.
p11623
aV\u201cLand\u2019s gone down, and\u000aperhaps the Funds may soon go down.
p11624
aVIn these dreadful times, you never\u000acan know.
p11625
aVJu, take your elbows off the table.
p11626
aVYou sit like a\u000awasher-woman.
p11627
aVI never saw such shoulders.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Funds are the country,\u201d said Gussy, \u201cthey can\u2019t go down, or England\u000awill be ruined.
p11628
aVJu, do you hear what mamma says?
p11629
aVHer shoulders are\u000asomething dreadful.
p11630
aVTake your elbows off the table, for goodness\u2019 sake!\u201d\u000a\u000aJulia took not the slightest notice of these remarks.
p11631
aVShe sat with both\u000aelbows on the tablecloth, eating bread-and-butter at an elevation of\u000amany inches over her neglected plate.
p11632
aV\u201cI have heard,\u201d said Janet, \u201cthat the people who are called smart people\u000ado that now.
p11633
aVIt has become the fashion: so Julia is in advance of us\u000ainstead of being behind, as you think.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, shaking her head, \u201cbad manners are the fashion,\u000aand that is a dreadful thing to say.
p11634
aVI remember in my young days--but\u000afortunately we don\u2019t know anything about smart people here.\u201d\u000a\u000aJulia\u2019s elbows had disappeared with the rapidity of magic.
p11635
aVShe would not\u000ahave it supposed that she meant to be smart or in the fashion whatever\u000aanyone might say.
p11636
aVCHAPTER VIII.
p11637
aVJanet found after this experience was over that she had perhaps\u000adiscounted too quickly the excitement of her position.
p11638
aVShe had gone too\u000afast, as was the impulse of her nature.
p11639
aVJulia Harwood, who had been used\u000ato continued \u201cnagging,\u201d which never came to anything, a continual and\u000afrivolous demand to which obedience was never exacted, had been taken\u000aentirely by surprise by the rapid movements of the little governess.
p11640
aVReason, which had never before been applied to her case, had made a\u000aconsiderable impression upon her; but still more the conviction that\u000aMiss Summerhayes would \u201cstand no nonsense,\u201d the wholesome sense of a\u000aforce which she could not overcome: and between the two the temporary\u000aeffect produced had been great.
p11641
aVAnd a certain amount of order had\u000afollowed in the school-room.
p11642
aVWhen the two were alone, Julia replied when\u000ashe was spoken to, and did more or less what she was told.
p11643
aVThere was a\u000aframe-work created of lessons and rules which helped the hours along,\u000aand to which the girl gave a sort of submission.
p11644
aVBut apart from this,\u000awhich occupied the mornings of her new existence, poor Janet found\u000aherself immersed, submerged, drowned in a sort of tepid bath of\u000aHarwoodism which was an experience quite unlooked-for and unthought-of.
p11645
aVSome families, and those perhaps the most amiable in existence, have\u000athis tendency so strong that there is no escape from it; they compare\u000aeverything, judge everything, estimate everything by the rule of their\u000aown case--\u201cin our family we do,\u201d or \u201cwe don\u2019t do,\u201d so and so, were words\u000acontinually on Augusta Harwood\u2019s lips.
p11646
aVShe was a very good, considerate,\u000akind young woman, trying to make everybody comfortable about her, eager\u000ato anticipate every want, to see that the stranger was warm enough, cool\u000aenough, had just the right amount of sugar in her tea, was not\u000aover-tired, did not have damp feet or wear too thin a dress, or get the\u000asun or the firelight in her eyes.
p11647
aVGussy achieved the difficult feat of\u000amaking a dependent perfectly at her ease, and obliterating almost every\u000atrace of that embarrassment which attends the position of a governess.
p11648
aVIt was not that she fell into one of those sudden enthusiastic\u000afriendships which sometimes unites the daughter of the house with the\u000astranger in it, but only that she was constitutionally kind, thoroughly\u000agood-hearted and good-natured.
p11649
aVIt would seem difficult to say any more\u000ain her favor than this.
p11650
aVAnd yet, from her gentle, amiable, and\u000agood-humored sway there arose one fixed impression: and in her pleasant\u000aperson there breathed out, embracing all things, one mild, universal\u000aatmosphere of the family.
p11651
aVIt was as if she knew nothing but Harwoods in the world.
p11652
aVChurch--even\u000aChurch!--and State, and laws and governments, and business and books\u000awere outside of the oasis in which she dwelt--the universe in general\u000alay beyond, as great London lay beyond the brick walls of the garden in\u000aSt. John\u2019s Wood.
p11653
aVLondon existed for the advantage of that house, and so\u000adid the universe in which London is but a point.
p11654
aVBut they were outside,\u000aand of secondary importance.
p11655
aVThe Harwoods, their habits, their ways,\u000atheir ancestors, their relationships, and, above all, their\u000acharacteristics were within, and everything without took a tinge from\u000athis prevailing atmosphere.
p11656
aVIt might be some time before the spectators found out what it was.
p11657
aVIt\u000awas like the transparent veil of tarlatan which is sometimes stretched\u000abetween a drawing-room assembly of spectators and an exhibition of\u000a_tableaux vivants_, to give distance and softness to the mimic scene; it\u000awas like the tint sometimes supposed to be becoming to the complexion,\u000awhich faintly rose-colored glass gives to the air of a boudoir: it was a\u000amedium, an atmosphere, all pervading, something from which there was no\u000aescape.
p11658
aVJanet had been prepared, as has been seen, for many of the deprivations\u000aof a governess, none of which she was called upon to bear.
p11659
aVThe letters\u000ashe received from her old friends at Clover, to whom she had narrated\u000aher first experiences, were almost enthusiastic in their\u000acongratulations.
p11660
aV\u201cYou seem to have been fortunate above anything that could be hoped\u000afor,\u201d Mrs.
p11661
aVBland wrote.
p11662
aV\u201cI never heard of such kind people.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd so they were, Janet assured herself.
p11663
aVNever were people so kind; they\u000acared for her comfort as if she had been a favored visitor; they never\u000aallowed her to feel herself _de trop_.
p11664
aVThey accepted her into the bosom\u000aof the family with the most open as well as the most considerate\u000akindness.
p11665
aVNevertheless, it was not very long before Janet began to feel\u000athe creeping in of something not strong enough to be called miasma, a\u000asort of closeness in the air.
p11666
aVShe felt the heavens contracting round\u000aher, and the horizon closing up.
p11667
aVThese sensations were more or less\u000aphysically justified by the fact that there is a great deal of\u000avegetation in St. John\u2019s Wood; that the trees grew too close in a\u000ahundred gardens, and that though their foliage and greenness were\u000adelightful in summer, the fall of the leaf was attended with\u000adisagreeables there as in other leafy places; but that was not the heart\u000aof the matter.
p11668
aVJanet began to feel herself drawing long breaths of relief when she got\u000aoutside the garden gate.
p11669
aVThis was generally in company with Julia, who\u000adid not share in the family worship, and whose conversation was very\u000ajerky and irregular, leaving the governess free either to lead the\u000adialogue or to refrain from any.
p11670
aVAnd when Janet escaped altogether by\u000aherself, as sometimes she did, to go to church, sometimes to the\u000acirculating library to get a book, sometimes to the nearest repository\u000aof art needlework to match some silk or crewels for Mrs. Harwood, she\u000awas still more delighted and relieved.
p11671
aVTo escape for an hour from the Harwoods--to become once more conscious\u000aof her own individuality, and of the existence of crowds, nay, worlds of\u000apeople who did not bear that respectable name, became the greatest\u000arefreshment to her.
p11672
aVShe would run out even in the wet if anything was\u000awanted in the most cheerful and, as the family thought, self-denying\u000away.
p11673
aV\u201cBut, my dear, it rains.
p11674
aVI couldn\u2019t possibly let you go out in the rain,\u000ato take all the stiffening out of your crape, and, perhaps, catch cold,\u000aall because I want that book,\u201d Mrs. Harwood would say, divided between\u000aher desire for a new novel (which is so doubly acceptable on a wet day)\u000aand her concern for Janet.
p11675
aVThis was a thing that the gardener could not do, nor even her own\u000amaid--could that functionary have been persuaded to wet her feet--for\u000amaids and gardeners never know what books you have read, even though\u000athey themselves have brought them from the library, and produce the same\u000athree volumes again and again, as Mrs. Harwood complained, till you are\u000anearly driven out of your senses.
p11676
aV\u201cIf you really think you would like a run,\u201d the old lady added, with a\u000asudden sense of the advantage.
p11677
aV\u201cI remember when I was your age I never\u000aminded the rain--but it will take all the stiffening out of your crape.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe has no crape on that dress,\u201d said Gussy, \u201cwhich I very much approve\u000aof, for what is the good of a thing you have always to be thinking of?
p11678
aVWe never go in for mourning very much in our family.
p11679
aVBut, mamma, I do\u000athink, what with your books and your crewels, and so forth, you impose\u000avery much on Miss Summerhayes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, I like it,\u201d cried Janet, \u201cit gives me the greatest pleasure.
p11680
aVI only\u000awish I could run on errands all day long, if I could be of any use--you\u000aare all so good to me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is a grateful little thing, Gussy,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, as Janet,\u000awrapped in a mackintosh, with her skirts drawn up, and a little felt hat\u000aupon her head which could not be spoilt, ran lightly along the\u000aglistening path to the garden door.
p11681
aV\u201cYes,\u201d said Gussy, sedately, \u201cshe is a kind little thing: and I am sure\u000ashe would do anything to please you, mamma.
p11682
aVAnd such a good influence\u000aover Ju.
p11683
aVDolff will not believe his eyes when he comes home and sees her\u000aactually doing her lessons like any other girl.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope Miss Summerhayes does not humor her too much,\u201d said Mrs.\u000aHarwood, with a sigh.
p11684
aVIn the meantime, Janet was running along with the rain in her face, and\u000aa sense of freedom which made her heart dance.
p11685
aVIt was not an attractive\u000aday to be out, and the long roads in St. John\u2019s Wood, between the garden\u000awalls, with here and there a little oasis formed by a few shops, were\u000anot, perhaps, exhilarating to pedestrians generally.
p11686
aVOn a wet day there\u000awas nothing at all to be seen or met with in these roads any more than\u000ahad they been the suburbs of a country town.
p11687
aVOn fine days the children\u000aand their nurserymaids made a great deal of variety, and the old ladies\u000agoing out for their airings in their bath chairs.
p11688
aVIt is not, perhaps, a\u000avery gay kind of traffic which is represented by bath chairs and\u000aperambulators.
p11689
aVBut there were the tradesmen, too, and occasional cabs\u000apassing to add to the effect.
p11690
aVBut when it rained everything was\u000adesolate.
p11691
aVThe garden doors were closely shut: the houses invisible\u000abehind among the bare branches of the trees from which the last shabby\u000aleaves were tumbling like rags among the droppings of the rain.
p11692
aVWhat it\u000ais to be twenty, and to have a heart free of care!
p11693
aVJanet ran along the\u000aglistening pavement with her skirts held up, delighted, glad to be out,\u000athough she breathed almost as much rain as air, glad to have escaped\u000afrom the all-enveloping Harwoods, and to be herself for a moment.
p11694
aVShe\u000awas only going on an errand for her employer, and her return was\u000aanxiously looked for, so that she knew that she must not be long: but\u000aevery moment was good.
p11695
aVShe carried her umbrella shut; she would not lose\u000athe feeling of the soft rain on her forehead.
p11696
aVA conviction that this was\u000aagainst all the traditions of the Harwoods made it doubly agreeable.
p11697
aVThey were all afraid of catching cold and getting wet, but not Janet.
p11698
aVShe liked it.
p11699
aVIt meant a mark of freedom and independence.
p11700
aVIt meant\u000abeing herself without a thought of Harwoodism, as she had been in the\u000aold days.
p11701
aVJanet skipped into the stationer\u2019s shop to which she was bound, and\u000awhich stood only (alas!)
p11702
aVabout a quarter-of-a-mile off in one of the\u000aoases already described.
p11703
aVIn St. John\u2019s Wood there are a great many\u000astationers\u2019 shops.
p11704
aVThey are doubled with a circulating library, usually\u000aa branch of the all-pervading Mudie, and they sell all manner of \u201cfancy\u201d\u000aarticles, cardboarding of every description.
p11705
aVThere is a great sale for\u000amenu cards, for little mounts and frames, for calendars and almanacs,\u000aand every sort of little composition of paper, pictures, and mottoes in\u000apretty colors, in such districts.
p11706
aVPencils in boxes and out of them, with\u000alittle holders, with silver cases, and unadorned for drawing purposes:\u000awriting materials in pretty colored covers: little books such as\u000ainnocent minds love, with texts for every day, or pretty verses, or\u000ascraps of genteel philosophy.
p11707
aVIt would fill all my space if I were to\u000agive a catalogue of half the things in these stationers\u2019 shops.
p11708
aVIn\u000aaddition to all this and the library, with its rows of novels, a little\u000adilapidated, there was a counter for music in this particular example of\u000athe stationers of St. John\u2019s Wood, and another one for newspapers both\u000athese things forming a portion of the well-established business carried\u000aon by the Misses Mimpriss in Laburnum Place.
p11709
aVWhen Janet skipped in, her face fresh from the rain and cold air, her\u000aeyes dancing with freedom and satisfaction, she almost ran against a\u000agentleman who was standing inside turning over the music, and who turned\u000around quickly with a mixture of surprise and curiosity.
p11710
aVHe was a young\u000aman and rather handsome, Janet thought; not very tall but strong and\u000awell built, with dark hair and a fine complexion, a little like,\u000aperhaps, the male beauties in the hairdressers\u2019 shops.
p11711
aVShe was so much\u000ataken by surprise to find a man in that feminine place that she was,\u000aperhaps, a little severe in her hasty judgment.
p11712
aVHe interfered with her\u000asatisfaction somehow, though he was perfectly well-bred, and after the\u000aone glance of surprised attention--which was quite justifiable surely\u000awhen a girl came like a bombshell into a little shop, where no such\u000aprojectile could have been expected on a wet day--returned to his music\u000aand took no further notice.
p11713
aVThe momentary shock, however, made Janet\u2019s\u000afresh countenance blaze with its surprise and unexpectedness.
p11714
aVShe went\u000aback into the further part of the shop to look over the novels and\u000achoose one which Mrs. Harwood would like, which was no easy task.
p11715
aVShe\u000ahad to ask for the help of the disengaged sister, who presided over\u000athat shrine of fiction, and had a long consultation with her to see\u000awhich books Mrs. Harwood had already read.
p11716
aVFinally, she chose one with\u000amuch internal doubt, intensified, she could scarcely tell how, by the\u000apresence of the man who stood with his back to her, certainly not\u000ainterfering in any way with that simple operation.
p11717
aVAnd it happened to\u000amake matters worse that the sister whom Janet was consulting was not the\u000asister whose business it was to enter the books.
p11718
aVAccordingly, when\u000aJanet\u2019s Miss Mimpriss said to the other Miss Mimpriss \u201c391,-121 for Mrs.\u000aHarwood,\u201d the gentleman who was buying music turned half round again,\u000aexactly as if he had said, \u201cOh!\u201d and gave Janet a look, not like the\u000aformer look, which was merely conventional, but one which was personal\u000ato herself, and meant several things.
p11719
aVIt was a glance full of\u000aunderstanding, as if he knew all about her, and of criticism, and\u000aamusement.
p11720
aVHis eyebrows went up a little, and he seemed to say, \u201cOh!
p11721
aVso\u000athat is who you are?
p11722
aVIt is you, is it?\u201d which made Janet very angry,\u000athough for the life of her she could not have told why.
p11723
aVShe took her\u000athree battered volumes in her hands and left the shop, feeling her\u000alittle expedition to be quite spoiled.
p11724
aVShe had meant to make an\u000ainvestigation herself among the music and to look over the \u201cfancy\u201d\u000aarticles.
p11725
aVShe was only after all a country young lady; and she believed\u000athat among the many pretty things which the Miss Mimprisses sold at a\u000acost of from one to two shillings, she could have found something which\u000aMrs.
p11726
aVBland would have set upon the drawing-room mantelpiece in the\u000avicarage, bidding her visitors look what a pretty thing Janet had sent\u000aher from London, and was it not kind of the child?
p11727
aVJanet could not linger, however, to make any such purchase under that\u000aman\u2019s eye.
p11728
aVShe would not have liked to do it before anybody, and had,\u000aindeed, jibed at the fancy articles when she had entered the shop with\u000aMiss Harwood; but she felt much aggrieved to be so balked.
p11729
aV\u201cVery like a barber\u2019s block,\u201d she said to herself; the sort of man whom\u000ayou might expect to see in that respectable part of St. John\u2019s Wood,\u000abuying music, which perhaps he was going to take with him to some\u000atea-party, to sing to the ladies.
p11730
aVWhen she had exhaled her annoyance in this angry criticism, Janet\u000arecovered some portion of her pleasure, and walked home, but much more\u000aslowly, in order that she might have the enjoyment of every moment of\u000aher freedom, and not go in too soon.
p11731
aVWe are all much displeased when\u000amaids and page-boys, and other light-hearted but slow-footed messengers,\u000ado this, and keep our letters or our novels from us, forgetting that\u000athese functionaries too might, like Janet, have need to feel themselves\u000anow and then, and be able to think, as they walk along Acacia Road, that\u000athey are John or Mary, and not mere officials executing our will.
p11732
aVThat night began just as other evenings had begun after dinner.
p11733
aVThe\u000afamily group was very comfortable, warm and safe from all contention of\u000athe elements which had settled into a downpour outside, from all\u000ainharmonious noises or interruptions within.
p11734
aVMrs. Harwood and Gussy at\u000aopposite sides of the fire, Miss Summerhayes seated at a little distance\u000awith the book upon the table, the very book which she had got from the\u000alibrary, and which she had volunteered to read aloud while the others\u000aworked.
p11735
aVVery comfortable, but rather dull, but for the book, which was\u000asomething, and lent an interest to the monotonous night.
p11736
aVWhen lo!
p11737
aVall at once, in the midst of this monotony and unbroken calm,\u000athe stillness was suddenly broken by the tingle of the house bell.
p11738
aVSomebody at the door!
p11739
aVLate in the evening, nearly nine, an hour at which\u000ano stranger step or sound ever disturbed the house.
p11740
aVJanet stopped\u000areading involuntarily, and grew pale in her surprise, looking round upon\u000aher companions with a sort of appeal.
p11741
aV\u201cBless us,\u201d cried Mrs. Harwood, \u201cwho can this be so late at night?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is, perhaps, a telegram,\u201d said Gussy.
p11742
aVAnd then she glanced at the\u000aclock, and added, \u201cIt is not so very late.
p11743
aVWe have had people come later\u000athan this.\u201d\u000a\u000aGussy had a little light, not usually there, kindled in her eyes.
p11744
aVShe\u000alet her work drop upon her knees and listened.
p11745
aVThe sound of the\u000aunwilling parlor-maid sallying out in the wet to unlock the door, the\u000asound of a voice and another step, even of a dripping umbrella placed in\u000aa stand, and an overcoat being taken off, were listened to by the ladies\u000awith much unanimity of interest.
p11746
aVEven Janet was glad that something was\u000acoming to break the calm routine.
p11747
aVWhen this last stage of suspense was\u000areached, Gussy said,\u000a\u000a\u201cIt will be Charley Meredith and his songs,\u201d and laughed a little, as it\u000awere, under her breath.
p11748
aVAnd then the door opened, and there walked in, with the assured step of\u000aone who knew himself welcome, the man of the music and the stationer\u2019s\u000ashop, the man who had looked round upon Janet as she got her novel,\u000asaying, \u201cOh!\u201d with his eyes.
p11749
aVCHAPTER IX.
p11750
aVJanet drew instinctively a little out of the way of the new-comer.
p11751
aVIt\u000awas not, we fear, with any intention of effacing herself, but to satisfy\u000athe spectator\u2019s privilege of watching all that happened and\u000aunderstanding every new situation.
p11752
aVThe change that had come over Gussy\u2019s\u000acountenance took her by surprise.
p11753
aVShe had not thought it possible that\u000asuch an illumination and transformation could take place in so calm a\u000aface, and it betrayed Miss Harwood instantly to Janet\u2019s quick\u000aperceptions.
p11754
aVShe was a little person whose reflections were very\u000arapid--who saw in a moment a whole succession of possibilities.
p11755
aVHer mind\u000aflashed from one to another in sudden surprise, conviction, imagination,\u000aasking herself was the man worth it?
p11756
aValmost in the same flash of\u000aintelligence with which she perceived that to Gussy he was the first of\u000amen.
p11757
aVJanet saw various other matters in the moment of pushing back her chair.
p11758
aVShe saw that the stranger, now in the act of approaching Gussy, whose\u000ainterest in him was so visible, recognized herself, and was surprised,\u000awith the slightest, scarcely visible, elevation of his eyebrows, as if\u000aasking an explanation.
p11759
aVShe saw also that Mrs. Harwood made a slight\u000amovement of pleasure in the chair which she never quitted, as if in her\u000amind making the same little start of welcome which her daughter actually\u000adid.
p11760
aVJanet would not perhaps have gone farther than this if her\u000aattention had not been called by another movement of a different kind.
p11761
aVJulia, who had been lying as usual on the rug with her book between her\u000amother\u2019s chair and the fire--a position which she could not be persuaded\u000aor forced to resign--suddenly disappeared with a sort of scrambling\u000asound and movement, which came in not unlike a hiss into the very\u000adifferent sentiment with which the welcome of the others was given.
p11762
aVDid\u000ashe actually make some such sound between her closed teeth?
p11763
aVAt all\u000aevents, Janet\u2019s rapid judgment flew to the conclusion that Julia\u000adetested while the others cherished the visitor.
p11764
aVHer own keen eyes made\u000aan inventory of him and all his visible qualities in a moment.
p11765
aVWas he\u000aworth it?
p11766
aVHe was well-looking, nay, very good-looking, she concluded in\u000athat instantaneous survey: but a little of the order of the barber\u2019s\u000ablock--good features, very white where whiteness was becoming, very\u000abright in color where color was necessary: good eyes, dark, and with\u000aconsiderable power of expression, which he entirely understood and could\u000amanage; the whiskers of respectability carefully kept under, disturbed\u000aby no extravagance of moustache or beard; dark hair that curled in a\u000avery attractive way in close vigorous rings; not tall.
p11767
aVThis, in Janet\u2019s\u000aopinion, was the worst thing about him; for a girl\u2019s hero has always six\u000afeet of stature at the least.
p11768
aVAnd he was perfectly well dressed in\u000awell-fitting evening clothes, which, though so generally objected to in\u000amatter of form, are yet, with their large foreground of dazzling linen\u000aand background of blackness, almost always becoming to men.
p11769
aVAll these\u000athings Janet remarked in a glance; but as for her first question, was he\u000aworth it?
p11770
aVshe had not yet come to any decision at all.
p11771
aVGussy made no movement to present the stranger to the governess.
p11772
aVShe\u000agave him a chair so near herself that Janet was obliged to draw back a\u000alittle more to get herself out of the way.
p11773
aVIt was the first time that\u000ashe had found herself _de trop_ in the little circle.
p11774
aVShe was not,\u000ahowever, at all wounded by this, being very curious and much excited by\u000athe little drama which thus seemed to come to light under her eyes.
p11775
aVIt\u000amust have been existing for some time, Janet thought.
p11776
aVThey must have\u000areached at least the end of the second, if not the third, act, and with\u000aquite a flush of interest she settled herself to watch its progress.
p11777
aVWas\u000ashe _de trop_?
p11778
aVWould they rather she went away?
p11779
aVWas Julia\u2019s\u000adisappearance a signal for her--a hint that she was not wanted.
p11780
aVThese\u000aideas passed through Janet\u2019s head, but without disturbing her.
p11781
aVShe\u000awanted above all things to follow this story out.
p11782
aV\u201cI have only just got back to town,\u201d said Mr. Meredith.
p11783
aV\u201cI have had a\u000alonger holiday than usual this year.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSo we suppose, or I made sure we should have seen you,\u201d said Gussy,\u000awith undisguised pleasure in her face.
p11784
aV\u201cThat seems like making a claim of right upon Charley\u2019s time,\u201d said Mrs.\u000aHarwood; \u201cwe must not do that, for it is the last thing that young men\u000alike.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think Gussy understands me best,\u201d he said, \u201cso far as that goes.
p11785
aVOf\u000acourse I should have come in any case the first evening I had.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet said to herself that they must at least have begun the third act,\u000aas they called each other by their Christian names.
p11786
aV\u201cYou say in any case?\u201d said Gussy, with an inquiring look.
p11787
aV\u201cYes; fancy what was the first thing I heard to-day.
p11788
aVI went into\u000aMimpriss\u2019s on my way to the Temple to get some pencils, and there was\u000asome one inquiring for books for Mrs. Harwood: so I knew that you also\u000ahad reached home.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, yes, we have been at home a long time!\u201d said Gussy.
p11789
aV\u201cMamma never\u000alikes to be long away: and Ju--you know Ju--was going down hill like an\u000aexpress train, getting more and more unmanageable and refractory every\u000aday.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut I am happy to tell you, Charley, that Miss Summerhayes seems likely\u000ato work marvels.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis was the only thing that approached an introduction, and Janet did\u000anot know whether to take any notice.
p11790
aVMr. Meredith, however, jumped to\u000ahis feet, and made her a bow.
p11791
aV\u201cIt was Miss Summerhayes I saw changing the books,\u201d he said.
p11792
aVGussy made no remark.
p11793
aVShe was not in the least disturbed by this\u000agreeting.
p11794
aVJanet had not even the satisfaction of thinking that Miss\u000aHarwood did not wish her to seek the visitor\u2019s acquaintance.
p11795
aVShe ignored\u000aher altogether, as if she was of absolutely no importance--which was\u000amuch harder to bear, and a great surprise to the governess, who had\u000ahitherto been treated with so much regard.
p11796
aV\u201cMamma cannot do without her books,\u201d she said, calmly.
p11797
aV\u201cAs for me, I\u000ahave not heard a note of music since you have been away.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe must take order about that,\u201d he said.
p11798
aV\u201cI brought something with me\u000ato-night, a new thing by--what\u2019s his name--one of the men you like.
p11799
aVThe\u000asoprano part is very nice.
p11800
aVWe can try it over to-night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd how did you leave your Aunt Owen, Charley, and what are they doing\u000adown in that part of the country?
p11801
aVDear me, what changes I should find,\u000ato be sure, if I were to go down there again.
p11802
aVAll the Plinlimmons swept\u000aaway, and my friends at the Grange, and Agatha Lloyd, and----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t think of it, mamma,\u201d said Gussy, humming over the air with the\u000amusic in her hand, and interrupting herself to run in a few words\u000abetween the bars.
p11803
aV\u201cThink of your own people, and how well we all\u000aare--tum--tum--ti-tum--tum--and don\u2019t let us distress ourselves about\u000astrangers, tu-tu--tu-tu--tum-tum.
p11804
aVYes, I think I shall like this.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYour friends at the Grange have not been swept away, Mrs. Harwood.
p11805
aVThey\u000aare in perfectly good case, and made the most tender inquiries for you.
p11806
aVI came home full of Welsh news for you; but it blows away after a day in\u000achambers.
p11807
aVAsk me as many questions as you please, and it will all come\u000aback.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, never mind!\u201d said Gussy, with an impatience quite unusual to her.
p11808
aV\u201cTell us rather what you have been doing yourself.
p11809
aVHave you had any\u000asport?
p11810
aVHave you met any nice people while you have been away?
p11811
aVHave you\u000abeen singing a great deal, or met anybody whose voice goes with yours?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot one like you,\u201d he said, with a glance that made Gussy\u2019s color rise.
p11812
aVHe added, after a moment, \u201cThere were some ladies at the Lloyds\u2019 who\u000awere very good musicians.
p11813
aVWe had a little practice now and then.
p11814
aV\u201cYoung ladies?\u201d asked Gussy.
p11815
aV\u201cWell--yes, some of them were young.
p11816
aVOne was a capital accompanist, and\u000aher sister\u2019s voice was something quite remarkable.
p11817
aVWe managed that duet,\u000adon\u2019t you know, that we never could master, of Brahm\u2019s.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh!\u201d said Gussy.
p11818
aVThe color went slowly out of her face, leaving her\u000avery pale and gray.
p11819
aV\u201cYou must have enjoyed yourself very much,\u201d she\u000asaid, in a subdued tone.
p11820
aV\u201cNot so much as I do--here,\u201d he said, lowering his voice and bending\u000atowards her: and Janet, ever watching, saw Gussy\u2019s face take fire again\u000aand glow with a tender flush.
p11821
aVWas the man worth it?
p11822
aVHe seemed to play\u000aupon her like an instrument, blowing her upwards one moment, the next\u000abringing her down to the ground.
p11823
aVAll this time not the least notice had been taken of the governess, who\u000awent on with her sewing with a little thrill of observation and\u000aattention in her which ran to her very finger points.
p11824
aVEven these finger\u000apoints seemed to be roused into seeing and hearing, reading meanings,\u000aand judging looks.
p11825
aVJanet felt as if she were sitting apart at the\u000arehearsal of a play.
p11826
aVIn this end of the room where the personages of the\u000adrama were sitting everything was light and brightness; but the other\u000awas like an unoccupied auditorium, the lights low, and the space vacant,\u000athough quite in the depths of the scene there was an open piano with a\u000agleam of white keys showing out of the dimness.
p11827
aVHad Gussy left the piano\u000aopen on purpose?
p11828
aVShe had been in the habit of scolding Julia for that\u000ainjurious habit, but Janet now remembered that it had been left open for\u000aseveral nights.
p11829
aVAnd where was Julia?
p11830
aVand was it perhaps, understood that\u000ashe should vanish with her pupil?
p11831
aVAll these things perplexed and\u000adisturbed Janet, who did not know what was meant.
p11832
aVPresently the scene changed, the dim background lighted up, and there\u000awere two people between her and the gleaming white keyboard of the\u000apiano.
p11833
aVThe episode grew more exciting than ever, for the two--lovers?
p11834
aVsurely they must be lovers--were going to sing together.
p11835
aVJanet\u2019s\u000aattention, however, was distracted for a moment or two by the same\u000alittle stifled sound which she had heard before, and looking up she saw\u000aJulia glide from behind the curtains and come back to her place on the\u000arug.
p11836
aV\u201cJulia,\u201d cried Mrs. Harwood, \u201cyou will end by making me frightened.
p11837
aVWhat\u000ado you mean by that elfish way of stealing out and in?
p11838
aVCan\u2019t you have a\u000alittle respect for your sister?
p11839
aVIt is not so often that she sings.\u201d\u000a\u000aJulia fixed upon her mother her usual dogged look, lifting her head from\u000aher book, then, to Janet\u2019s supreme surprise, vouchsafed an answer.
p11840
aV\u201cShe\u2019s so silly,\u201d the girl said, with a glance of scorn.
p11841
aV\u201cDo you hear, Miss Summerhayes?\u201d said the old lady.
p11842
aV\u201cShe is\u000aincorrigible.
p11843
aVI thought we had come to an end of all that, Ju?\u201d\u000a\u000aJulia gave her mother another look, then returned to her book, with\u000aagain a faint hiss from between her closed teeth.
p11844
aV\u201cShe is so much interested in her book,\u201d Janet made haste to say.
p11845
aV\u201cWhen\u000aone gets into the heart of a story at her age one thinks of nothing\u000aelse.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you think, Miss Summerhayes, that Ju ought to read so many novels?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI thought,\u201d said Janet, faltering, \u201cthat it was with your permission.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh,\u201d cried Mrs. Harwood, \u201cI thought you might have seen by this time\u000ahow little they care for anything I say.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe looked irritable, cross, disturbed, as Janet thought she had never\u000aseen her before, and moved uneasily in her chair.
p11846
aVBut she had shown no\u000asuch annoyance when the visitor came in.
p11847
aVShe had received him with a\u000acheerful welcome, and he had seemed in no doubt on that subject.
p11848
aVIndeed,\u000athe young man had come in and taken his place among them with the\u000afamiliarity and complacency of a favored visitor who expected to confer\u000aas well as to receive pleasure.
p11849
aVThat line in Mrs. Harwood\u2019s brow had not\u000aappeared till Julia, with her dogged look, had stared into her mother\u2019s\u000aface.
p11850
aV\u201cI wish,\u201d cried the old lady, \u201coh, I wish that Adolphus would come\u000ahome!\u201d and she wrung her white, plump hands with almost a tragic\u000agesture, which was so strangely unlike her comfortable person, and all\u000athat Janet had hitherto known of her, that the little governess had hard\u000aado not to laugh.
p11851
aV\u201cDo you expect Mr. Harwood soon?\u201d she asked.
p11852
aV\u201cThey are all very self-willed, Miss Summerhayes.
p11853
aVYou must have seen\u000athat, already.
p11854
aVGussy of course will not be guided by me.
p11855
aVShe thinks that\u000athings are meant which probably are not meant at all--except to pass the\u000atime.
p11856
aVAnd Julia, though she is not more than a child, sets herself up\u000ain judgment as if she were--do you think I can do anything to stop\u000ait?--even if it were desirable to stop it.
p11857
aVAnd why should I, for that\u000amatter, even if I could?
p11858
aVIt would be suitable enough.
p11859
aVHow am I to tell,\u000aMiss Summerhayes, with no one to advise me, and such self-willed\u000achildren to deal with?
p11860
aVOh, I wish--I wish that Adolphus were here!\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet did not know what to make of this sudden burst of confidence.
p11861
aVShe\u000awas afraid to seem to wish to pry into her employer\u2019s concerns, yet,\u000awith the impulse of youth, which is at once a kind meaning and a\u000amovement of vanity, wanted to say something which should be\u000aconsolatory--to put forth her own little hand as a guide in the\u000acircumstances of which she was so entirely ignorant.
p11862
aV\u201cI am sure, dear Mrs. Harwood, no one would do anything which they knew\u000ayou really disliked--you are so good.
p11863
aVPerhaps they don\u2019t know that you\u000areally dislike--anything that may be going on.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo Janet\u2019s surprise, Mrs. Harwood received this enigmatical utterance as\u000aif it had thrown real light upon the situation.
p11864
aVShe put her handkerchief\u000ato her eyes.
p11865
aV\u201cI dare say you are right, my dear.
p11866
aVI always said you were full of\u000aunderstanding for so young a thing.
p11867
aVPerhaps that\u2019s what it is, after\u000aall.
p11868
aVI don\u2019t speak out.
p11869
aVIt would be much more sensible if I were to\u000aspeak out.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere was a momentary silence, and the sound of the singing came in, the\u000atwo voices \u201cgoing\u201d together, rising into a burst of melody in the higher\u000anotes which made Janet pause and hold her breath.
p11870
aVMr. Meredith had a\u000abeautiful tenor voice, and Gussy\u2019s, though not so good, aided the effect\u000awith a somewhat tremulous second, twining out and in of the clear and\u000aliquid masculine notes.
p11871
aVJanet let her work drop and her attempt at\u000aconsolation together, and sat rapt gazing at the pair.
p11872
aVShe was too\u000ayoung, too energetic, too ambitious for pure sympathy.
p11873
aVShe gazed with\u000aimpatient longing to be in the midst of it.
p11874
aV\u201cOh!
p11875
aVwhat a weak accompaniment!\u201d she said to herself.
p11876
aV\u201cWhy don\u2019t they\u000aask me to play it for them?
p11877
aVShe might sing to her heart\u2019s content; but\u000a_why_ doesn\u2019t she ask me to play?\u201d\u000a\u000aJane forgot Mrs. Harwood, whom she had been in the act of advising and\u000aconsoling, and Julia, who was her special care.
p11878
aVShe could scarcely\u000arestrain herself.
p11879
aV\u201cIt is too much for Miss Harwood to sing and play both,\u201d she said, with\u000aa sudden impulse, dropping her work upon the floor, half rising as if to\u000arush to the rescue.
p11880
aVHer own movement, however, brought her to herself;\u000afor what right had she, a stranger and a hireling, to interfere?
p11881
aV\u201cMiss Summerhayes!\u201d said Mrs. Harwood.
p11882
aVAs this was all that was said, Janet detached her eyes from the scene at\u000athe piano, and looked at the old lady in the chair.
p11883
aVMrs. Harwood was\u000atalking energetically with her eyes and gestures, though she said\u000anothing.
p11884
aVShe indicated Julia with a glance, then looked towards the\u000adoor.
p11885
aVShe put her plump hands together with a little pantomimic prayer.
p11886
aVJanet saw and understood, and sighed.
p11887
aVShe wanted to have a hand in the\u000amusic; she wanted to watch the story which was going on, which as yet\u000ashe did not understand.
p11888
aVBut no.
p11889
aVHer duty lay in another direction.
p11890
aVIt\u000awas the first time that she had felt her chains.
p11891
aV\u201cJulia, come, come; it is our time,\u201d she said briskly.
p11892
aVMiss Harwood at the piano, who had her back turned, took no notice of\u000athe little commotion of the withdrawal; but Mr. Meredith turned round,\u000astill singing, and gave Janet a look out of those eyes which she had\u000adeclared to herself were too black, too bright, too ostentatiously\u000afringed with eyelashes--a look which meant respectful regret, a tinge of\u000aremonstrance, a veiled entreaty to stay, a sort of _au revoir_ unspoken\u000abut eloquent.
p11893
aVHe could not make more than a slight inclination of his\u000ahead, as he was singing, but the effect was that of the most deferential\u000abow.
p11894
aVJanet was taken altogether by surprise.
p11895
aVHad he appreciated her\u000aposition all in a moment, read her abilities in her eyes, longed to have\u000aher at the piano as she longed to be there?
p11896
aVor was it a mere impulse of\u000asubjugation, the instinct of the conqueror who desired another victim?
p11897
aVShe was so startled that her heart jumped up suddenly like a bird as she\u000aleft the room, and made one or two big beats in her ears.
p11898
aVAnd then she\u000alaughed to herself apparently without any meaning at all.
p11899
aVCHAPTER X.
p11900
aV\u201cMiss Summerhayes!
p11901
aVwhy did you laugh as we came upstairs?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh!\u201d said Janet, quite restored from that momentary impression.
p11902
aV\u201cI\u000adon\u2019t know.
p11903
aVBecause it is curious to come into the middle of a story; it\u000ais like beginning a book, as you do sometimes, at the third volume.
p11904
aVOne\u000awonders what has happened before, as well as what is going to happen\u000anow.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou think that\u2019s a story!\u201d cried Julia, with scorn; \u201cbecause Gussy\u2019s a\u000afool, and that man--I can\u2019t endure that man.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou make that too easy for anyone to see.
p11905
aVI think you made a sound like\u000awhat they do in the theatre.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI hissed him,\u201d said Julia, her lowering eyebrows closing down over her\u000aeyes.
p11906
aV\u201cI always do.
p11907
aVHe can\u2019t bear to be hissed.
p11908
aVHe is just like an\u000aactor: it makes him mad, and that is why I do it, and I always shall.
p11909
aVI\u000adon\u2019t care what anyone says.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is a pity,\u201d said Janet; \u201cfor it will not harm him, but you.
p11910
aVYou\u000aforget that people care very little for the opinion of a girl at your\u000aage, especially when it is rudely expressed.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey don\u2019t care much for your opinion,\u201d said Julia, furiously.
p11911
aV\u201cNo; I did not expect it; and I have no opinion, except that you must\u000alearn to be a gentlewoman--if that can be learnt--or else I must go\u000aaway.\u201d\u000a\u000aJulia received this, as she usually did Janet\u2019s remonstrances, with a\u000alook of rage, a flush of shame, and then a sudden self-subdual.
p11912
aV\u201cYou want to go away,\u201d she said.
p11913
aV\u201cYou are the only nice one that has\u000aever been here; and you want to go and leave me.
p11914
aVI know you do.
p11915
aVYou\u2019ll\u000ago before Dolff comes home, and then he\u2019ll never know you, and will\u000athink--will just think I am a stupid and don\u2019t know anything, as they\u000aall do!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, my dear child,\u201d said Janet, who understood this broken speech\u000aperfectly well, and knew that she was being represented to \u201cDolff\u201d in\u000athe brightest colors, a thing by no means indifferent to her, \u201cthey are\u000anot very far wrong if they think so; for a girl who hisses--even in the\u000atheatre----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI did once,\u201d cried Julia, \u201cin the theatre!
p11916
aVThey had a hideous ballet in\u000athe pantomime like what one reads of in books--a woman making a show of\u000aherself--oh!\u201d The girl\u2019s cheeks blazed crimson at the thought.
p11917
aV\u201cAnd I\u000ahissed--like this.\u201d Here Julia uttered a sound, in comparison with which\u000aa whole serpent-house in highest exasperation would have retired\u000adefeated, with the whole force of her youthful energy and breath.
p11918
aV\u201cGussy\u000apinched me black and blue to stop me, and I wouldn\u2019t.
p11919
aVThey never would\u000atake me to the theatre again.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t wonder,\u201d said Janet \u201cSo now you hiss the people who come to\u000acall.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOnly Charley Meredith,\u201d said Julia.
p11920
aV\u201cAnd,\u201d she added, subduing her\u000atones, \u201cif he came in the morning I should not mind: but he comes at\u000anight without being invited, with his music, as if mamma was obliged to\u000ahave him whether she liked or not.
p11921
aVAnd he gives himself such airs, as\u000aif he knew that Gussy--you think I don\u2019t care for Gussy, Miss\u000aSummerhayes--but I do.
p11922
aVI could kill her when she looks silly like that!
p11923
aVA woman!
p11924
aVto let a man see that she----oh!
p11925
aVI could kill her when she\u000alooks at him like that!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is a pleasant way of showing how much you care for her,\u201d said\u000aJanet.
p11926
aV\u201cIt is quite natural that at fourteen you should think you know\u000abest; but if I hear you hiss again,\u201d--the governess kissed the tips of\u000aher fingers--\u201cgood-bye, my dear; that\u2019s all that there will be to say.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou say that to beat me down,\u201d cried Julia.
p11927
aV\u201cYou don\u2019t really care, not\u000aa bit, whether I behave myself or not.
p11928
aVI am not sure that you are any\u000abetter than Charley Meredith.
p11929
aVI don\u2019t know that there is not just a pair\u000aof you.
p11930
aVWell, then, do it if you like, there!
p11931
aVtake him away from Gussy,\u000abreak everybody\u2019s heart, make Dolff think me a stupid for all I\u2019ve said.
p11932
aVI can see in your eyes that\u2019s what you\u2019d like to do.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have made me out a very pretty programme,\u201d said Janet, laughing.
p11933
aV\u201cI\u000athink I shall begin by looking over your exercises, and giving you\u000adouble black marks for everything.
p11934
aVWe need not have come upstairs so\u000aearly but for that pretty habit of yours; and, for my part, I would\u000arather listen to the music than to a little girl storming.
p11935
aVOh, yes, my\u000adear, I know you are taller than I am, but that makes no difference.
p11936
aVBe\u000aquiet; we can hear it mounting up now that I\u2019ve opened the window a\u000alittle.
p11937
aVAh!
p11938
aVbravo!
p11939
aVthat was well done.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you really care for that squalling?\u201d Julia demanded, with a mixture\u000aof wonder and scorn.
p11940
aVJanet was standing by the window which she had opened.
p11941
aVThe school-room\u000awas over the drawing-room, though on the second floor, and in the quiet\u000aof the night Mr. Meredith\u2019s fine voice came out like the blast of a\u000asilver trumpet.
p11942
aVThe night was mild and very still, and perhaps Janet\u2019s\u000ayouthful bosom was still a little fluttered by that sudden surprise\u000awhich had made her heart beat.
p11943
aVShe leaned a little out, listening, with\u000aa natural self-pity that she was not there, and realization of the\u000adifferent fate of Gussy, to whom music and love and all the softnesses\u000aof life were open, while she was sent away out of sight with a naughty\u000achild.
p11944
aVJanet had far too much strength to give in or permit anyone to\u000asee that she suffered from this, nor, indeed, did she suffer more than\u000athe vague and momentary sensation of being at a disadvantage.
p11945
aVBut she\u000aleaned out to listen with a little wistfulness, impatient of the\u000achildish vehemence, and as yet but little awakened to the deeper nature\u000aof her unmanageable pupil.
p11946
aVThis pensive mood, however, was soon to be\u000ainterrupted.
p11947
aVIn the very midst of the liquid notes ascending from below,\u000athere came suddenly, as if it rent the air, a wild and wailing cry--the\u000acry as of a spirit in pain.
p11948
aVIt seemed to Janet to rise almost from her\u000aside, close by.
p11949
aVShe started back from the window and turned round with a\u000ascared and terrified exclamation,\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is that?
p11950
aVWhat is that?\u201d\u000a\u000aFor a moment it occurred to her that some terrible accident or hurt must\u000ahave happened to the girl by her side.
p11951
aV\u201cI--don\u2019t know,\u201d said Julia, stammering as if she could not get out the\u000awords.
p11952
aVBut she was not terrified as Janet was.
p11953
aVThe governess did not\u000anotice this at first in her own panic.
p11954
aVShe ran to the door of Julia\u2019s\u000aroom, from which direction the sound seemed to come, and flung it open\u000acrying, \u201cWho is there?
p11955
aVWho is there?\u201d then shut it again in terror of\u000awhat she might see.
p11956
aV\u201cOh, run and fetch some one!
p11957
aVoh, go and alarm the house, Julia!
p11958
aVthere\u000amust be something dreadful in there.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s nothing,\u201d said Julia.
p11959
aV\u201cWhat are you making such a fuss about?
p11960
aVIt\u2019s--a boy outside--they make such hideous noises--it\u2019s----\u201d\u000a\u000aShe stopped, for the same sound was repeated, this time lower and\u000afurther off, as it seemed--a cry of pain dropping into a low prolonged\u000awail.
p11961
aVJanet rushed to the school-room door and out upon the staircase,\u000acalling for help, for some one to come.
p11962
aVShe was wild with alarm.
p11963
aVThere\u000awas no doubt in her mind that some wretched creature, a madman,\u000aprobably, had got into the rooms.
p11964
aVBut all was quiet in the house below, the doors all shut, everybody\u000aoccupied with their own business, singing going on in the drawing-room,\u000atalk in the servants\u2019 apartments downstairs--nothing it would seem had\u000abeen disturbed but Janet alone.
p11965
aV\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d repeated Julia.
p11966
aV\u201cOh, Miss Summerhayes, come back,\u000aplease, and don\u2019t make a fuss.
p11967
aVMamma is so angry if there\u2019s any fuss\u000amade.
p11968
aVIf I go into my room and look all round, and convince you there\u2019s\u000anobody, will that do?
p11969
aVThere\u2019s nobody, I know.
p11970
aVIt\u2019s either a boy passing\u000aoutside, or it\u2019s an owl or something that lives under the ivy in the\u000awing.
p11971
aVMamma knows.
p11972
aVIf you ask her to-morrow she\u2019ll tell you; but, oh,\u000afor goodness\u2019 sake, Miss Summerhayes, don\u2019t make a fuss to-night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYour mother knows?
p11973
aVDo you mean that--it has been heard before?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou look as if you thought it was a ghost,\u201d said Julia, who, however,\u000awas very pale.
p11974
aV\u201cWe have no ghosts in our house.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was like the cry of a mad creature--it was----Julia, if it comes\u000aagain I can\u2019t bear it.
p11975
aVIt must be some madman who has got in.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf it\u2019s a madman he can\u2019t get near us,\u201d cried Julia, \u201cfor he\u2019s in the\u000awing.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet came back into the school-room, still trembling with her fright.
p11976
aVShe dropped into a chair, unable to support herself.
p11977
aV\u201cYou know--you know what it is,\u201d she said, faintly.
p11978
aV\u201cI know--it\u2019s something in the wing.
p11979
aVIt does no harm.
p11980
aVSometimes it will\u000acry like that--oh, once in a year, perhaps.
p11981
aVIt can\u2019t do any harm.
p11982
aVOh,\u000aMiss Summerhayes, do be reasonable when I tell you.
p11983
aVWhat does it matter?
p11984
aVI don\u2019t know what you mean, to be so taken up with their squalling and\u000ashouting, and in such a state when you hear a cry.
p11985
aVI don\u2019t care either\u000afor one or the other,\u201d Julia said.
p11986
aVIt cannot be said that Janet showed much interest in the \u201csqualling and\u000ashouting\u201d of which her pupil was so contemptuous after this.
p11987
aVThe two\u000achanged their _rles_ completely for the rest of the evening, during\u000awhich Julia, though not without a titter for her companion\u2019s weakness,\u000asoothed and patronized Miss Summerhayes, and addressed to her many\u000aphilosophical admonitions, which naturally were much more self-confident\u000aeven than the exhortations of Janet, in themselves by no means deficient\u000ain the certainty of youth.
p11988
aV\u201cWhat can it matter to us,\u201d said Julia, \u201cwhat a noise is?--unless you\u000ahappen to like noises which people make, squalling at the top of their\u000avoices and call music.
p11989
aVA noise can\u2019t hurt you; it can\u2019t do you any harm.
p11990
aVYou hear it, and that\u2019s all--especially when it\u2019s only like a voice.
p11991
aVI\u000aam not fond of thunder, myself, for a thunderbolt might fall on the\u000ahouse or crush you; but a cry--what does it matter?
p11992
aVPeople are always\u000acrying out, or making some nasty noise.
p11993
aVYou should pay no attention to\u000ait.
p11994
aVI never pay any attention; it is not worth while.
p11995
aVWhy, you might\u000aspend your life thinking of such things, if you were to be disturbed by\u000aevery sound you hear.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis discourse did not satisfy Janet or even calm her mind, but she\u000areflected after a while that it was not the part of a governess to put\u000avisionary terrors into the mind of her pupil, and so far recovered\u000aherself with an effort as to satisfy Julia that it was safe to go to bed\u000aand leave Miss Summerhayes.
p11996
aVPoor little Janet, when left alone, felt for\u000athe first time how terrible it was to be so young, so impressionable,\u000aand among strangers.
p11997
aVShe dared not run downstairs, as a girl at home\u000awould, to shake off her terrors by confiding them to some one who could\u000aauthoritatively calm and reassure her.
p11998
aVMrs. Harwood had been very kind\u000ato her governess, but to go down again after she had been dismissed, to\u000ameet Gussy\u2019s astonished look turning round from the piano, and the\u000amother\u2019s suspicious glance which would ask what she wanted, why she\u000acame?--was impossible to Janet.
p11999
aVShe felt to-night, for the first time,\u000awhat it was to be a governess, although to-night, for almost the first\u000atime, she had realized what she had expected when she came out into the\u000aworld, how amusing it was to watch a story going on.
p12000
aVHow soon had all\u000ainterest in the story disappeared from her mind in the face of this\u000aterror which froze her very blood!
p12001
aVWhat was it?--was it a spirit or a\u000aliving creature in pain?
p12002
aVWhere was it?--in this tranquil house, as Julia\u000aseemed to allow?
p12003
aVAnd worst and most dreadful question of all--would it\u000acome again?
p12004
aVThis last thought was the one that kept all her faculties\u000aawake.
p12005
aVMight it at any moment burst once more out of the quiet?
p12006
aVJanet\u000athought that if she had to undergo that moment of horror again she must\u000ago mad or die.
p12007
aVShe was afraid to go to bed--afraid to close her\u000aeyes--lest she should be awakened by that cry.
p12008
aVThe singing went on late\u000adownstairs, and Janet listened anxiously to the departing of the\u000avisitor, the bolting of the door behind him, the little bustle as Mrs.\u000aHarwood was wheeled to her room on the ground floor, and Gussy came\u000aupstairs.
p12009
aVBut she did not come as far as the school-room, which she\u000asometimes did to see if all was well.
p12010
aVIt was too late to disturb any\u000aone--to wake up the sleepers.
p12011
aVJanet heard Miss Harwood coming upstairs\u000asinging softly over to herself her part in one of the duets.
p12012
aVGussy was\u000ahappy; no alarm or sense of desolation was in her.
p12013
aV\u201cIf I were happy like that I would come upstairs to see how the poor\u000alittle governess, all alone, was getting on,\u201d Janet said to herself,\u000aopening her eyes in the dark.
p12014
aVBut, indeed, she would have done nothing\u000aof the kind.
p12015
aVShe would have been perhaps more indifferent than Gussy was\u000ato the governess in causeless trouble, feeling \u201cout of it\u201d--or else in a\u000avisionary panic thinking that she had heard a ghost.
p12016
aVThe night wore away gradually, and nothing happened.
p12017
aVWhen it was between\u000athree and four, Janet, worn out, fell fast asleep.
p12018
aVShe slept till the\u000abreakfast-bell rang, and had to hurry her dressing and hasten downstairs\u000awith an apology, wondering at herself and her own foolish terror in the\u000ared light of the wintry morning.
p12019
aVGussy was very ready, it was evident,\u000ato be questioned about last night.
p12020
aVShe began her self by expressing her\u000adistress that Janet had been hastened away for \u201c_that_ child,\u201d and\u000anarrated to her with subdued triumph how many \u201cthings\u201d Mr. Meredith and\u000ashe had gone through, and what good practice it was.
p12021
aV\u201cThe Harwoods generally are so unmusical,\u201d Gussy said; \u201cI never did get\u000aany encouragement at home.
p12022
aVBut fortunately mamma likes Charley, and he\u000amay do what he pleases.
p12023
aVI do enjoy a musical evening so.
p12024
aVHasn\u2019t he a\u000adelicious voice?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is a charming voice,\u201d said Janet.
p12025
aV\u201cAnd he is so well trained.
p12026
aVTo sing with him it is like getting a\u000alesson.
p12027
aVHe wanted to know whether you were musical, but I said I\u000afeared----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI used to be thought pretty good for accompaniments,\u201d said Janet.
p12028
aV\u201cOh, really!\u201d but Gussy did not receive this statement with much\u000adelight.
p12029
aV\u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll help me to practise my part,\u201d she said, and\u000areturned to sound the praises of Charley.
p12030
aVJanet would not introduce the subject of her own terrors, and if she had\u000abeen ever so intent upon doing so, there was no opportunity, for Charley\u000aand his songs and his perfections left no room for any other discourse.
p12031
aVAnd when Mrs. Harwood appeared matters were not much better.
p12032
aVThe old\u000alady remarked that Janet was pale, and feared that she had not been able\u000ato sleep for the singing.
p12033
aV\u201cThe fact is that Mr. Meredith has not been in London for a long time,\u000aand I could not cut them short, could I, the first night?\u201d\u000a\u000aTo describe the impatience with which Janet heard all this would not be\u000aeasy.
p12034
aVShe said to herself, what was Mr. Meredith to her?
p12035
aVWhat were his\u000asongs, his attentions, the grief of his absence, the joy of his return?
p12036
aVShe listened with a great eagerness to interrupt, to break through this\u000aeternal burden of the self-occupied to whom their own little affairs\u000awere everything, with her own questions.
p12037
aVBut when Mrs. Harwood\u2019s voice\u000astopped Janet did not find hers.
p12038
aVWhat could she say?
p12039
aV\u201cI heard a dreadful cry last night.
p12040
aVWhat was it?
p12041
aVYou know what it was!\u201d\u000aIt seemed to her when she turned this question in her mind that it was a\u000athing impossible to say.
p12042
aV\u201cI heard--last night,\u201d she began.
p12043
aV\u201cAh, the singing!\u201d cried both ladies together.
p12044
aV\u201cI hope it did not keep\u000ayou from your sleep, my dear,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood.
p12045
aVAnd, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u000acould not hear me, and Charley\u2019s voice is always a pleasure,\u201d cried\u000aGussy.
p12046
aVJanet\u2019s mouth was closed, and she could say no more.
p12047
aVCHAPTER XI.
p12048
aVJanet\u2019s life seemed to herself to change from this day, though no one\u000aelse seemed aware of any difference, and all its outward expressions\u000awent on as before.
p12049
aVFor a few nights she was afraid to sit alone\u000aupstairs, and hurried to bed in the hope of getting to sleep, and thus\u000aavoiding any repetition of the cry which had so rung through and through\u000aher on the night of Mr. Meredith\u2019s first appearance; but, as the days\u000aand nights passed in perfect tranquillity, this scare passed away from\u000aher mind, and she began to be able to explain to herself that it must\u000ahave been some boy in the road outside, belated and anxious to make a\u000asensation in that still neighborhood, or perhaps that fancy had\u000aexaggerated the fantastic wailings of a love-sick cat into something\u000aportentous and terrible.
p12050
aVBoth these things were possible, but that\u000aanything mysterious could exist in this comfortable, modern, respectable\u000ahouse, where everything went as on velvet by carefully kept rule and\u000aorder, was an idea too ridiculous to be entertained.
p12051
aVAt night, it is\u000atrue, Janet had various fallings back from this confidence, and reminded\u000aherself with renewed panic that Julia had heard and had not been\u000aastonished as she was, but evidently was aware of some explanation which\u000ashe did not give.
p12052
aVThese grew fainter and fainter, however, as one week\u000apassed after another, and nothing occurred.
p12053
aVThere was one thing, however, which Janet only remarked after this\u000aperiod, though she was afterwards assured that it was no secret, but\u000amight have been seen from the first day, and that was the appearance of\u000aa man-servant in the house where none but women ever waited upon the\u000afamily.
p12054
aVShe met him one day going across the hall, a respectable,\u000aserious man of middle age, just such a butler as Mrs. Harwood ought to\u000ahave had.
p12055
aVBut the ladies had no butler; they had a highly-respectable\u000aparlor-maid, just such as, failing the butler, a family in St. John\u2019s\u000aWood, entirely _comme il faut_, must have had--tall, staid,\u000agood-looking, but not too good-looking, well-dressed, and thirty-five.
p12056
aVThe man, who had all the air of perfect familiarity with the house, and\u000awho was in indoor dress, with noiseless shoes, went across the hall from\u000athe servant\u2019s quarters towards the side upon which was the wing, an\u000aapparently unoccupied part of the dwelling.
p12057
aVAfter that first meeting, which startled her, Janet saw this man again\u000aand again.
p12058
aVThere was no explanation of him, he was never seen but in\u000athese chance encounters, yet he was no secret, nor was his presence in\u000aany way concealed.
p12059
aVWhat, after all, had a stranger to do with it?
p12060
aVIt was\u000anothing to Janet.
p12061
aVBut her strong sense of spectatorship, and the\u000acuriosity of imagination which made her keen to find indications of a\u000astory anywhere or everywhere, caused a half-conscious groping on the\u000apart of the governess among unexplained incidents.
p12062
aVIt was some time,\u000ahowever, before she began to associate the mysterious man-servant with\u000athe alarming outcry which had almost, she thought, deprived her of her\u000awits, ringing as it did into the silence of the night.
p12063
aVAfter a few weeks\u000ahad passed, she asked herself if, indeed, she ever had heard it at\u000aall--whether it was not a delusion of her senses, the reverberation of\u000asome well-known and vulgar sound.
p12064
aVNeedless to say that Janet had read\u000a\u201cNorthanger Abbey,\u201d and had been taught to smile at the investigations\u000aof our dear little Catherine, and their amusing issue: though, to tell\u000athe truth, her sympathy in Catherine Morland\u2019s thirst for romantic\u000aadventure had been more strong than her amusement in the result, which\u000adisappointed her a little too.
p12065
aVHowever, not even a romantic imagination disposed towards discoveries\u000acan survive the uneventful progress of weeks in which nothing happens.
p12066
aVAnd Janet meantime had the other story going on before her eyes which\u000ashe could study at her ease.
p12067
aVMr. Charles Meredith and his visits became\u000anow the chief interest of life in the house in St. John\u2019s Wood.
p12068
aVHe dined\u000aonce or twice, but only in company with another visitor; and on those\u000aoccasions Janet did not form one of the party.
p12069
aVGussy explained that it\u000awould \u201cput out the table.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf I were to invite gentlemen for you and Ju, it would make quite a\u000aparty, and mamma does not like parties when Dolff is away.
p12070
aVAnd then Ju\u000ais too young to dine when there is company,\u201d said Miss Harwood.
p12071
aV\u201cOh, you must not think of me!\u201d Janet would reply; but when she heard\u000athe gentlemen arrive, and the increased sound of voices as the servants\u000awent out and in of the dining-room, and the little cheerful commotion,\u000ait is undeniable that Janet remembered Mrs. Bland\u2019s little sermons about\u000athe fate of a governess.
p12072
aVShe did not like it.
p12073
aVShe had never been left out in her life before.
p12074
aVJanet was not shy; she had always been used to take a somewhat\u000aprivileged place in the little society she was acquainted with.
p12075
aVShe\u000acould talk; she was not afraid of anybody who might drift into the\u000alittle world of Clover; and she loved variety, which is a thing not\u000apermitted to governesses.
p12076
aVOn these occasions supper was brought up to\u000athe school-room for Miss Summerhayes and her pupil.
p12077
aVIt was brought late,\u000aand they had to wait and yawn on opposite sides of the table for the\u000acold and tardy meal.
p12078
aVOn such occasions it was difficult to make herself\u000aamusing to Julia, or to find Julia amusing.
p12079
aVIt was dull.
p12080
aVIt produced a\u000acertain mortification in Janet\u2019s mind to find that she cared.
p12081
aVShe said\u000ato herself, with a little bitterness of which she was ashamed, that she\u000ahad no doubt it was a very dull party, and that the two strangers were\u000anot in the least interesting.
p12082
aVShe recalled to herself her previous\u000aconviction, that to be left alone to do what she pleased, to read a\u000anovel or write a letter, would be a pleasant relief.
p12083
aVNo, it was not so;\u000ashe wanted to be in the dining-room with the rest, hearing what was\u000asaid, even if she had to remember her own position and take little part.
p12084
aVShe wanted to see how the drama was going on, and how the hero looked\u000awhen there was some one to compare him with.
p12085
aVThat scene would glide in\u000aher imagination in front of her novel, with the attraction of a pleasure\u000aout of reach.
p12086
aVAnd Julia was a dull companion on these occasions.
p12087
aVShe\u000ayawned and wondered when they would bring the supper.
p12088
aV\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting to be kept so long waiting, and all the things like\u000astones when they do come,\u201d Julia would say; \u201cI shall complain to mamma.
p12089
aVIf all the others are so busy, Vicars might bring it up, once in a way.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWho is Vicars?\u201d said Janet.
p12090
aV\u201cOh, he is the man; he never goes into the dining-room except when Dolff\u000ais here--but he might bring up our supper if all the rest are so busy.
p12091
aVAs if there was any reason to make such a fuss!
p12092
aVTwo men to dinner!
p12093
aVYou\u000awould think there were twenty, all fine ladies and gentlemen, to see how\u000aGussy goes on.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey are probably great friends, and more important than twenty ladies\u000aand gentlemen,\u201d said Janet, with her most correct governess air.
p12094
aV\u201cOh, you know well enough!
p12095
aVIt is Charley Meredith, and they will\u000acaterwaul afterwards till it makes me quite ill to hear them.
p12096
aVAnd Gussy\u000awill look so silly.
p12097
aVOh, why does a woman look so silly when there is\u000anonsense like that going on?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is generally the man who is supposed to look silly,\u201d said Janet.
p12098
aVInvoluntarily she thought of poor Dr. Harding and his proposal; and the\u000ahard-hearted young woman laughed in spite of herself.
p12099
aV\u201cWhat are you laughing at?
p12100
aVYou are remembering something.
p12101
aVTell me, tell\u000ame, Miss Summerhayes!
p12102
aVI suppose,\u201d said Julia, with deep discrimination,\u000a\u201cthat the man looks silly when it is he who wants it most.
p12103
aVNow, here it\u000ais Gussy who wants it most.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJulia, you have no right to discuss your sister.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, but you can\u2019t stop me doing it!\u201d said Julia, with composure; \u201cyou\u000acan stop me when--when I\u2019m silly myself.
p12104
aVI was a great fool, I know.
p12105
aVI\u000athought once I could drive you away--no, I didn\u2019t want to drive you\u000aaway.
p12106
aVI wanted to get the upper hand; but you\u2019ve got the upper hand of\u000ame, and I don\u2019t mind now.
p12107
aVHowever, that\u2019s quite different.
p12108
aVThis is a\u000afree country, and I can say what I please of Gussy.
p12109
aVI say that it\u2019s\u000ashe----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs it is a free country, you can\u2019t compel me to listen,\u201d said Janet;\u000a\u201cbut there is one thing in which it is not a free country, and that is\u000athat you are not permitted to be ill-bred.
p12110
aVIt is not allowed to be\u000avulgar.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh!\u201d cried Julia, coloring to her eyes, but affecting to laugh, \u201cas if\u000athere were not hundreds and thousands?\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet shrugged her little shoulders in a manner which her pupil,\u000arebellious, but admiring, thought irresistible.
p12111
aV\u201cOut in the streets, perhaps: so are there applewomen, and people who\u000asell matches.
p12112
aVBut in good time here comes the tray, and something for\u000ayou to do.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet, however, was not far from being of Julia\u2019s opinion.
p12113
aVMiss Harwood,\u000awho had been so calm, who had explained that the quiet family life so\u000aunbroken, the long evenings of needlework and talk, might appear dull to\u000aJanet, but were never dull to her mother and herself, now went through\u000athese evenings as in a dream.
p12114
aVMeredith came twice, sometimes three\u000atimes, in a week, after dinner, as he had done on his first appearance.
p12115
aVHe had privileges which were extended to no one else, and it was never\u000aknown on which evening he would appear.
p12116
aVHe even took pains, Janet\u000athought, to have no rule, to appear suddenly when he was not looked for.
p12117
aVBut to this spectator, whose attention was fixed upon Gussy, as on the\u000aheroine of the drama, it was very easily apparent that there was no\u000aevening on which he was not expected.
p12118
aVShe worked, she talked, she made\u000aher little disquisitions as usual, but there was a certain fixed\u000aattitude of her head, a little almost imperceptible pause now and then\u000ain the movements of her hands, which showed that she was listening for\u000athe summons at the door, the step outside.
p12119
aVIn the quietness of the\u000asemi-rural suburban road the step of the rare passenger was sometimes\u000aheard even outside the garden wall.
p12120
aVSometimes Mrs. Harwood would say,\u000a\u000a\u201cI wonder if that is Charley Meredith?\u201d to which Gussy would reply, with\u000abeautiful composure,\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, no; he is always engaged on Thursdays!\u201d or, \u201cThis is never one of\u000ahis free nights.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut it was not lost either upon Janet or Julia that her hands were for a\u000amoment still, that her downcast eyes were fixed not on her work, and her\u000aentire frame rigid with intent listening.
p12121
aVThe attitude relaxed in a\u000amoment when the welcome sound of the bell pealed into the silence, a\u000alittle faint sigh of ease and happiness came from the bottom of her\u000aheart, her head regained its easy poise.
p12122
aVWhether the mother also saw\u000athese indications of supreme suspense and then of delightful relief,\u000aeven Janet, whom no circumstance escaped, could not tell.
p12123
aVPerhaps, like\u000aGussy, she thought that the visitor was of more account than the other\u000abystanders believed him to be.
p12124
aVA little of the same enchantment hung over Gussy through all the\u000aordinary affairs of life.
p12125
aVThere was a liquid softness in her eyes that\u000ahad not been there before; her want of color, which was her great\u000adeficiency, seemed to be half compensated be the faintest rose-flush of\u000afeeling and sensibility which had come to her, no one could tell how.
p12126
aVWas it a sign of better health, greater vigor, than her tranquil\u000atemperament usually enjoyed?
p12127
aVHer mother said so, rejoicing over the fact\u000athat Gussy was \u201cso well.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe has quite a color,\u201d the visitors said.
p12128
aV\u201cWhat a good thing you went\u000ato Malvern this year; it has quite set Augusta up.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut the governess and her pupil knew it was not Malvern.
p12129
aVThe piano in\u000athe larger drawing-room was always open now, the lights were always\u000aprepared, and Gussy practiced her songs in the morning with a devotion\u000afor which Janet, a little moved by the _esprit de corps_, and unwilling\u000athat a woman should betray herself, blushed sometimes when the\u000aunwearying watchfulness of Julia, to whom no such awakening had come,\u000apointed out the performance going on below.
p12130
aV\u201cShe\u2019s practising again,\u201d Julia would say, in the midst of a lesson.
p12131
aV\u201cShe knows how necessary it is,\u201d cried quick-witted Janet.
p12132
aV\u201cI wish you\u000awere half as sensible.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut these little snubs, which were frequent, did not turn aside Julia\u2019s\u000akeen perceptions or break the unspoken sympathy of spectatorship that\u000awas between the two.
p12133
aVJulia, however, made no further demonstration of her dislike to the\u000avisitor, and Mrs. Harwood\u2019s satisfaction with the \u201cgood influence\u201d which\u000aMiss Summerhayes had acquired over the rebellious girl went on\u000aincreasing.
p12134
aV\u201cShe looks no more than a girl herself--and so she is, quite young, and\u000anever was out before--but her power over that unmanageable child is\u000asomething wonderful.
p12135
aVYou know, my dear, what poor Ju was.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, yes, I know what Ju was!\u201d replied, with fervor, the friend to whom\u000aMrs. Harwood confided her satisfaction.
p12136
aVWith too much fervor, perhaps;\u000afor when the person we blame is our own child, we desire no warmth of\u000aconviction, but rather a good-natured deprecation, as who should say, \u201cI\u000anever remarked it,\u201d or a warmer assertion, \u201cShe was always very nice to\u000ame.\u201d But the mother\u2019s confidant was not enlightened in this case.
p12137
aVShe\u000aacknowledged her perfect consciousness of the demerits of Ju.
p12138
aVThis checked Mrs. Harwood in full flow.
p12139
aV\u201cShe had always a great many defects of manner, but she was right in her\u000aheart, poor child, and as soon as you could get to that---- Well!
p12140
aVMiss\u000aSummerhayes has just that knack.
p12141
aVShe divined my poor Julia\u2019s warm heart,\u000aand to see her now you never would believe there had ever been any\u000atrouble.
p12142
aVShe was always more sensible than most girls, but self-willed\u000aand too frank.
p12143
aVNow, I think you would say there are few girls with\u000abetter manners, and all that little thing\u2019s doing, who really sometimes\u000alooks far more a child than Ju herself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDear me,\u201d said the visitor; \u201cbut I am glad, with my houseful of sons,\u000athat I have not got such a fascinating personage.
p12144
aVWhat is so good for\u000athe girls might be dangerous for the boys.
p12145
aVWhen do you expect Dolff to\u000acome back?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot before Christmas,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood; but she did not take the\u000agood-natured insinuation; she was too full of her present subject.
p12146
aV\u201cHe\u000awill be so delighted with the improvement in his sister.
p12147
aVDolff is very\u000afond of his sister; he is so domestic.
p12148
aVSometimes it is a little\u000adifficult to get him back from Oxford.
p12149
aVThey enjoy themselves so much in\u000atheir college with all their friends about them.
p12150
aVBut, when he does come\u000ahome, he is so good in taking Julia about and giving her treats.
p12151
aVJulia\u000awas always his favorite, even when she was most hard to deal with.
p12152
aVHe\u000awill be quite delighted now.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd Miss Summerhayes will go away, I suppose, for her holidays?\u201d said\u000athe far-seeing friend.
p12153
aVMrs. Harwood looked across the room at Gussy, with a half-alarmed,\u000ahalf-inquiring glance.
p12154
aVBut Gussy, who was once so quick to perceive all\u000apossible imbroglios--Gussy shook her head.
p12155
aVShe had been thinking with\u000asatisfaction that Miss Summerhayes would amuse Dolff, that her own\u000apursuits need not be interrupted for the sake of her brother.
p12156
aVShe shook\u000aher head in answer to her mother\u2019s unspoken question.
p12157
aV\u201cOh, no; she never thought of wanting a holiday so soon,\u201d Gussy said.
p12158
aVAnd so, unmoved by any warning, the Harwood family rushed on their fate.
p12159
aVCHAPTER XII.
p12160
aVThese musical evenings became now the central events in the life of the\u000ahouse in St. John\u2019s Wood.
p12161
aVWhen they did not occur, and the evening\u000apassed in its former quiet fashion, with the mother knitting in her\u000achair, and Gussy and Janet on the other side at their work, and Julia on\u000athe rug with her book, it was to all of them as if life were arrested,\u000aand that day did not count.
p12162
aVEverything went on as usual, but nothing was\u000aof any consequence.
p12163
aVThat this should be the case to the heroine of the\u000adrama who had the first _rle_ to play, and whose future might perhaps\u000abe entirely shaped and colored by what took place on these occasions,\u000awas natural enough; but it may be thought strange that an entire\u000ahousehold should hang, as it were, on the comings and goings of a\u000apresumed lover, whose actions could affect materially only one\u000aindividual, and to whom one at least of the lookers-on was indifferent\u000aand one hostile.
p12164
aVBut the hostility quickened the interest, and the\u000aindifference did not take away from it.
p12165
aVThe course of a wooing is always\u000aan excitement to a household of women.
p12166
aVIt is \u201cas good as a play.\u201d After\u000ait is concluded, in that moment of absorption when two engaged people\u000afollow each other about, and parade their special privileges and rights,\u000ait becomes odious, we are ready to allow; and the only desire in the\u000aminds of all reasonable persons is to get the marriage hurried on and\u000athe turtle-doves disposed of.
p12167
aVBut when all is still in the mists of\u000auncertainty, when it cannot be asserted that the entire fabric of the\u000adrama may not melt away again, and new complications take place, then it\u000ais that the spectators gather round, and every woman keeps a watch under\u000aher eyelids upon the progress of the affair.
p12168
aVThis is especially the case\u000awhen there is little doubt about the sentiments of one of the parties,\u000aand more so still when that one is the woman.
p12169
aVThe story will then\u000aacquire a sometimes painful interest, and the women who watch will feel\u000asomething of humiliation, something perhaps of resentment, against the\u000agirl who has given her affections without sufficient warrant, or the man\u000awho is dull enough not to perceive, or wicked enough to disregard, the\u000agift thus bestowed upon him.
p12170
aVThus the party of women in Mrs. Harwood\u2019s drawing-room were diversely\u000amoved, but all to the same end.
p12171
aVThe mother herself felt nothing but\u000aanxiety about her child.
p12172
aVShe was not an enthusiast for Charley Meredith,\u000athough she liked him well enough.
p12173
aVHis blue-black hair, his fine\u000amoustache, his bloom of roses or wax, his seductive eyes, and fine voice\u000awere not much to the old lady.
p12174
aVAnd she thought him too fond of music and\u000asociety, not sufficiently anxious to establish his practice and make his\u000aname known at the Bar, which was to be his means of living.
p12175
aVAs she sat\u000aand knitted, and listened, and looked on, her mind was full of\u000acalculations, often gone over, as to how much the two could scrape\u000atogether between them to begin housekeeping upon, and whether it would\u000ado?
p12176
aVMrs. Harwood naturally knew to a penny what her daughter\u2019s fortune\u000awould be, although she was not without anxieties lying deep in her soul,\u000aeven upon that point, which nobody guessed.
p12177
aVAnd as she was well\u000aacquainted with his Aunt Owen and his other relatives in Wales, and knew\u000ahow the family had been \u201cleft\u201d at his father\u2019s death, she had a\u000atolerably good guess as to what young Meredith was worth in the way of\u000amoney, and wished it had been more.
p12178
aVStill, if, when this period of\u000acourtship was over, he would more or less give up music, and devote\u000ahimself to work, what with Gussy\u2019s little fortune, and the remnants of\u000awhat he had from his father, they might do.
p12179
aVIt was not a very brilliant\u000aconclusion, but yet it might do.
p12180
aVWhen she had come to the end of one\u000asuch long course of calculations and thoughts, Mrs. Harwood would nod\u000aher head and say, \u201cThat is very pretty; what is it?
p12181
aVWho is it\u000aby?\u201d--questions of which in a general way no one took any notice; and\u000athen she would begin with her calculations again.
p12182
aVJanet naturally approached the question from an entirely different side.
p12183
aVShe said to herself that there was not the least doubt about Miss\u000aHarwood\u2019s sentiments, but she herself was generally treated as if she\u000awere a cabbage on these musical evenings.
p12184
aVThere was no notice taken of\u000aher.
p12185
aVThough they were so kind in all other ways, and though even Gussy\u000anever wavered in her friendliness on other occasions, on these she\u000aignored Janet altogether.
p12186
aVMr. Meredith made her a bow when he shook\u000ahands with Mrs. Harwood, and, if he were not absolutely in the middle of\u000aa song, he would make a rush to open the door for her when Julia and\u000ashe retired with their candles.
p12187
aVBut that was all, and Gussy went on all\u000athe time with her accompaniment (which she played so badly!
p12188
aV), and took\u000ano notice, except to call him back sometimes, the governess thought,\u000awith a little sharpness.
p12189
aVBut that was all.
p12190
aVWas it all?
p12191
aVIn the depths of her heart Janet felt that it was not.
p12192
aVMr.\u000aMeredith\u2019s eyes were fine, with almost too much eyelash for a man; they\u000awere undeniably like those bold orbs which shine from waxen faces in a\u000abarber\u2019s shop: but they had a way of opening very wide and expressing a\u000agreat deal of sentiment, which is not given to those representations of\u000amanhood, though at first Janet was wicked enough to think that if the\u000awaxen busts could look sentimental they would do it in a similar way.
p12193
aVWhen Janet, however, found that these great eyes were made for\u000aherself--when she discovered that Mr. Charles Meredith was asking pardon\u000aof her for his scant greeting, and throwing a good deal of respectful\u000aadmiration into the momentary but intense gaze which was from time to\u000atime directed upon her--and when, finally, she found herself almost by\u000athis same medium taken into his confidence, made to sympathize with him\u000awhen, having settled down for a comfortable chat, and secured a place\u000anear herself where he could conduct these telegraphic communications\u000aeasily, he was carried off without compunction by Gussy to the\u000apiano--Janet\u2019s opinion undeniably changed a little.
p12194
aVThere is nothing more flattering than to be made the confidant, to be\u000aput behind the scenes, to have the _dessous des cartes_ revealed to you;\u000aand the piquancy of the revelation, which was never put into words,\u000awhich was half her own quick perception, which could not have been made\u000ato any one whose understanding was less vivid, charmed her imagination,\u000awhich was still mischievous and curious like that of a child.
p12195
aVSometimes,\u000awhen Gussy led him away triumphant, he would give a rueful glance, and\u000ait was hard ado for Janet to restrain her impulse to laugh.
p12196
aVGussy swept\u000ahim away in her train as if he had been her own property, as if his\u000avisit had no other object than that piano, always open in the\u000abackground, which afforded such an easy mode of separation from the\u000aothers, and the suggestive delightful semi-privacy in which the two\u000avoices mingled as the two hearts were learning to mingle.
p12197
aVThat was\u000aGussy\u2019s view of the question, but it did not long continue to be\u000aJanet\u2019s.
p12198
aVWhen poor Gussy made, as now and then she did, a false note,\u000awhen she went wrong in those somewhat elaborate accompaniments which\u000aJanet knew she herself could play so much better, a momentary gleam from\u000aMr. Meredith\u2019s eyes, the pointed shrug of his shoulders or elevation of\u000ahis brows, gave Janet once more that inclination to laugh which it was\u000aso difficult to restrain.
p12199
aVIt did not at all occur to the girl behind backs that she was an\u000aaccomplice in a piece of domestic treachery.
p12200
aVIt was ludicrous to see the\u000aunconscious performer, full of complacency in her accomplishment,\u000aproducing those false notes; it was at once horrifying and laughable to\u000ahear the strange discords with which the piano came in.
p12201
aVJanet, who could\u000ahave done it so much better herself, felt a little shiver steal over her\u000aat the first jarring thrill, and what so natural as that he, who was\u000aevidently a good musician, should discover it, too, and seek her\u000asympathy.
p12202
aVAs these communications grew more frequent, it is true that\u000aJanet did feel a little shame now and then steal over her.
p12203
aVPoor Miss\u000aHarwood!
p12204
aVShe would not like it, the governess felt sure, if she\u000asurprised one of these glances; and thus, in the complacence of knowing\u000abetter, in the secret superiority of divining the sentiments of Gussy\u2019s\u000alover even better than Gussy did, the girl felt it almost impossible not\u000ato burst into a little laugh again.
p12205
aVWere these two floating on--as Gussy thought in her confident tenderness\u000aand glamour of love, as Mrs. Harwood thought in her anxious calculations\u000aand adding up of this and that to see whether it would do, as Julia, in\u000aher eager dislike and scorn and childish inexperience, was certain\u000aof--towards a happy _dnouement_ and a life of harmony together?
p12206
aVThis\u000awas what Janet did not know.
p12207
aVShe sat and wondered, going on with her\u000aneedlework.
p12208
aVJanet, who was not at all without experience, and who had\u000aseen that people in most things consider their own advantage and\u000apleasure first, as the protectress of her own childhood had done in\u000aadopting her, did not jump to the conclusion that Meredith had not the\u000aintentions which the others attributed to him.
p12209
aVBut she had a doubt which\u000anone of the others had.
p12210
aVShe sat and wondered, working on, anxious to be\u000aa little nearer, and hear what they were saying, longing to be asked to\u000atake that accompaniment, to be in the middle of what was going on.
p12211
aVThe\u000auncertainty lent the scene, which in any case would have been as good as\u000aa play, a still more vivid interest.
p12212
aVHer heart beat with the sensation\u000aof knowing so much more than the others, with wondering from day to day\u000awhat would be the next event, and how it would end.
p12213
aVStrangely enough,\u000ashe did not enter at all into Gussy\u2019s feelings, or conceive any sympathy\u000afor her.
p12214
aVLike Julia, like the very young in general, Janet was angry\u000awith Miss Harwood for being \u201csilly,\u201d for letting the visitor see his\u000aadvantage.
p12215
aVShe could not forgive the woman who made the advances, who\u000awas deceived and fancied herself beloved, and flung herself at the head,\u000aor at the feet, of a tardy lover.
p12216
aVShe was more impatient with Gussy for\u000athe glamour in her eyes, than with Meredith for having none, for\u000ashrugging his shoulders at the false notes.
p12217
aVIt came about, however, one evening, in the most natural manner in the\u000aworld, that Janet, trembling with impatience behind backs, and longing\u000ato be in the midst of it, achieved at last the active share she desired\u000ain what was going on.
p12218
aVShe never could tell whether it was accident or\u000awhether Meredith had chosen on purpose a duet of which the accompaniment\u000awas extremely difficult, such as Miss Harwood was quite incapable of.
p12219
aVAfter a few trials and failures, the practising came to a sudden end,\u000aand a little controversy evidently went on over the piano.
p12220
aVHe proposed\u000asomething which she did not consent to willingly.
p12221
aVBy-and-bye Gussy\u2019s\u000avoice, a little raised in vexation, reached the other end of the room.
p12222
aV\u201cI have no reason to suppose she can play at all,\u201d she said.
p12223
aVThen there was a murmur from Meredith and the name of Julia.
p12224
aV\u201cOh, yes!
p12225
aVenough to teach Ju; but Ju has no ear and no taste, and never\u000awill do anything.\u201d\u000a\u000aAgain the lover made a representation, inaudible, in Gussy\u2019s ear.
p12226
aV\u201cWell, if you like we can ask her; but it\u2019s always introducing a third,\u000aand spoiling----\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet\u2019s ears were so quickened by this time that she heard, or thought\u000ashe heard, him say, stooping close to Gussy\u2019s ear,\u000a\u000a\u201cWho can feel that like me?
p12227
aVBut she\u2019s only--seems to know her place.\u201d\u000a\u000aHeavens!
p12228
aVhow the heart jumped up in Janet\u2019s breast!
p12229
aVShe was sure she\u000aheard him say, \u201cseems to know her place.\u201d Her place!
p12230
aVand he who had made\u000aher his confidant, made her the judge, making fun of Gussy to her, as he\u000anow set her down so contemptuously to Gussy!
p12231
aVThe blood boiled in Janet\u2019s\u000aveins, a flood of thoughts and resolutions rushed through her mind.
p12232
aVShe\u000awould not play for them!
p12233
aVThey might break down, and Miss Harwood might\u000ajar him to death with her discords, for anything Janet cared.
p12234
aVHer place!
p12235
aVbehind their backs, without notice, without a word!
p12236
aVOh, yes, she would\u000akeep it, she would understand what it was, she would do nothing for\u000athem!
p12237
aVAnd then the pendulum swung the other way.
p12238
aVYes, she would play for\u000athem.
p12239
aVShe would show Gussy what a bungler she was.
p12240
aVShe would let them\u000aboth see that it was quite simple, nothing to make any fuss about, to\u000aherself no more than the easiest exercise!
p12241
aVShe would play, but never\u000abetray again that she was conscious of Mr. Meredith\u2019s existence, never\u000aseem to see his looks, treat him as if he were the cabbage----\u000a\u000aAll this ran through her thoughts in the moment, while Miss Harwood\u000aturned slowly round on her music stool, and he advanced a step, turning\u000atowards Janet a look of entreaty, and at the same time of private\u000aintelligence, such as all her resolution not to look could not prevent\u000aher from seeing.
p12242
aVGussy had never treated Janet with unkindness, never\u000ashown any want of consideration, save in ignoring her on these\u000aoccasions; but at present her voice sounded careless, disrespectful,\u000aalmost insulting.
p12243
aV\u201cMiss Summerhayes!\u201d she called out, carelessly.
p12244
aVJanet, with still that tumult in her breast, did not lift her eyes or\u000amove in her seat.
p12245
aV\u201cMiss Summerhayes!\u201d cried Gussy again.
p12246
aV\u201cMy dear,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, \u201cmy daughter is calling you.
p12247
aVI think you\u000adid not hear.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh!\u201d said Janet, and looked up as if she had heard for the first time;\u000aindeed, the force of her indignation gave her something of the feeling\u000aof one awakened from a dream.
p12248
aV\u201cWill you come here, please?\u201d said Miss Harwood.
p12249
aVNever before had there been between them the tone of command and\u000aobedience.
p12250
aVJanet reflected to herself bitterly that she was supposed to\u000aknow her place, and rose, but with a reluctance that anybody could see.
p12251
aVThis reluctance softened Gussy.
p12252
aVShe thought the other girl felt all the\u000ainappropriateness of being made the third between two----\u000a\u000a\u201cPlease come and look at this accompaniment.
p12253
aVI have never seen it\u000abefore, and it seems difficult.
p12254
aVWill you try it for us?
p12255
aVYou said you\u000acould play.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, I can play.\u201d Janet went slowly towards the piano.
p12256
aVHe might make\u000aeyes as he chose, she would not see them.
p12257
aVShe looked at the music while\u000aGussy rose and left the place for her.
p12258
aVEasy?
p12259
aVwhy, it was child\u2019s play!
p12260
aV\u201cI will play it if you wish me to do so;\u201d her fingers were crisp with\u000aimpatience to get at the keys.
p12261
aV\u201cOh, do, do, Miss Summerhayes!
p12262
aVwe are waiting for you.
p12263
aVA new\u000aaccompaniment and a new song at once are too much for anyone.
p12264
aVIs that\u000athe proper height for you?
p12265
aVis the light as you like it?
p12266
aVAh!\u201d he said,\u000awith a deep breath, \u201cthat is something like; now, Gussy!\u201d\u000a\u000aHe took her hand to draw her to his side, and over Gussy\u2019s colorless\u000aface there sprang anew that light as if it came through rose-leaves,\u000athrough some ethereal medium, a light ineffable, which neither sunlight\u000anor lamplight ever gave.
p12267
aVPoor Gussy!
p12268
aVthis was the look which made her sister\u2019s childish\u000acountenance lower, which was \u201csilly,\u201d which moved Janet to mingled\u000aridicule, wrath, and shame.
p12269
aVThese young critics had no mercy.
p12270
aVBut as she\u000astood by her lover\u2019s side and sang, all unkindly thoughts and every\u000alittle irritation went out of Gussy\u2019s soul.
p12271
aVShe was the only one of them\u000awhose mind was in true harmony with the music; the others were better\u000aperformers.
p12272
aVShe forgot that she had been displeased to have Janet called\u000ain.
p12273
aVShe touched the girl\u2019s shoulder tenderly, gratefully with her hand;\u000aher heart went out in the song, though she was not so very certain about\u000athe notes.
p12274
aVIt was not at all with these beautiful emotions that Janet plunged into\u000athe mazes of the notes.
p12275
aVShe played with rage, with fury, beating down\u000athe man who had wounded her, helping out the tremulous soprano; and\u000aMeredith, roused to the conflict, sang against her, till he, too,\u000aexcelled himself.
p12276
aVIt was like a musical duel, carried out to the last\u000anote with an intention which the two chief performers only were aware\u000aof; and Janet was ringing out the last symphony with her cheeks burning\u000aand her heart beating, when suddenly she sprang up from the piano and\u000acovered her face and her ears with her hands.
p12277
aV\u201cOh, there it is!\u201d she cried, \u201cthere it is again!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is--what?\u201d said Miss Harwood.
p12278
aVShe had been standing a step apart,\u000acontemplating with mixed feelings the performance from which she herself\u000ahad dropped.
p12279
aVShe came forward and laid her hand on Janet\u2019s shoulder.
p12280
aV\u201cWhat is the matter, Miss Summerhayes?
p12281
aVHave you done too much?
p12282
aVare you\u000aill?
p12283
aVWhat is it?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe voice, the voice!\u201d said Janet, still with her hands on her ears.
p12284
aV\u201cThe voice!
p12285
aVI heard the wind in the chimney, if that is what you mean.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd I heard nothing at all, except Miss Summerhayes\u2019 brilliant\u000aperformance,\u201d said Mr. Meredith.
p12286
aV\u201cMiss Summerhayes is not so complimentary to you.
p12287
aVShe evidently was not\u000athinking of your brilliant performance.
p12288
aVWhy, you are quite upset,\u201d said\u000aGussy with the faintest tone of contempt.
p12289
aV\u201cWhat is it?
p12290
aVWhat did she hear?\u201d cried Mrs. Harwood, sharply, from her\u000achair.
p12291
aVCHAPTER XIII.
p12292
aVThis little incident could not be said to have much effect upon Janet\u2019s\u000arelations with the family in which she was living, but yet it was not\u000awithout some influence on the new order of things.
p12293
aVShe had an interview\u000anext morning with Mrs. Harwood, who complimented her very much on the\u000abeneficial influence she was exercising over Julia.
p12294
aV\u201cI begin to hope that, after all, she will become a reasonable creature,\u000aand like other people,\u201d said the mother.
p12295
aV\u201cI need not tell you that she\u000ahas been a great trouble to me, and nobody we have had has ever got such\u000acommand of her before.
p12296
aVShe is growing very fond of you, Miss\u000aSummerhayes, and I hope nothing will occur to disturb this good\u000aunderstanding,\u201d she continued, with a little significance in her tone.
p12297
aVThen, after a pause, she resumed, as with an afterthought, \u201cOh!
p12298
aVthere is\u000ajust one thing I wanted to speak to you about.
p12299
aVI am afraid, my dear,\u000afrom what happened last night, that you are a little fanciful,\u000aeasily-frightened, terrified, they tell me,\u201d she said, with a little\u000alaugh, \u201cfor ghosts, and that sort of nonsense.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo--oh, no!
p12300
aVindeed, indeed I never was.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen, my dear,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, laying her hand, not unkindly, on\u000aJanet\u2019s arm, \u201cdon\u2019t begin now.
p12301
aVThey told me you heard something that\u000afrightened you.
p12302
aVBe quite sure that there\u2019s always a perfectly natural\u000aexplanation of anything you may hear.
p12303
aVThere is nothing whatever in this\u000ahouse to be frightened about.
p12304
aVMake yourself quite sure on that point,\u000aand we shall always get on perfectly well, I am convinced.
p12305
aVNow run away,\u000ayou and her.
p12306
aVI won\u2019t keep you longer.
p12307
aVI am sure it is time for your\u000awalk.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut, Mrs. Harwood----\u201d said Janet, with some timidity.
p12308
aV\u201cNo,\u201d said the old lady, \u201cI won\u2019t keep you any longer.
p12309
aVYou must not lose\u000athe sunshiny part of the day.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet lingered a moment longer, but her courage failed her.
p12310
aVHow could\u000ashe insist upon a thing which nobody paid any attention to but herself?
p12311
aVPerhaps, indeed, nobody but herself heard it at all.
p12312
aVIt might be\u000asomething which was addressed to herself alone; some mysterious warning;\u000asomething which could not find any other utterance.
p12313
aVThe little\u000agoverness, however, was so sensible and so perfectly modern in her\u000aviews that, though such a flattering and thrilling idea did occur to\u000aher, she did not entertain the notion.
p12314
aVWhy should she have a ghostly\u000avoice all to herself?
p12315
aVWhat could there be that she required to be warned\u000aabout in such a way?
p12316
aVJanet knew very little of her family, but they were\u000anot distinguished enough to possess a ghost.
p12317
aVShe did not believe that it\u000awas a ghost at all; it was something in trouble, something that had been\u000acaught in a trap, or perhaps the cry of some one who was mad, which was\u000aa very terrible suggestion.
p12318
aVTo see a ghost would be exciting indeed,\u000athough even the youthful imagination of the nineteenth century has\u000aovercome these kind of terrors--and there would be a distinction in the\u000avision of something supernatural which would more than make up for the\u000astrain upon the nerves; but to encounter a madman about the house or\u000agarden would be very different, a horror which would have no\u000acompensating superiority.
p12319
aVHow could she ask, however, of that calm old\u000alady in her chair whether she was quite sure there was no dangerous\u000amadman about?
p12320
aVSuch a suggestion might bring on something terrible; it\u000amight produce a fit, or something; it might kill Mrs. Harwood.
p12321
aVJanet\u000amade up her mind it was better to forbear, to wait a little longer, to\u000asee what might happen.
p12322
aVAnd she had not been insensible to the\u000asignificance of Mrs. Harwood\u2019s tone when she hoped that nothing would\u000aoccur to disturb their good understanding.
p12323
aVJanet was very quick-witted,\u000aand the tone was not lost upon her.
p12324
aVIt brought before her very\u000adistinctly the fact that Mrs. Harwood, if she pleased, could send her\u000aaway, and that it would not be pleasant to be sent away.
p12325
aVTo go of her\u000aown accord might be supportable, though she did not by any means desire\u000ait: but to be sent away would not do at all.
p12326
aVShe knew what all the\u000agossips at Clover would say.
p12327
aVThey would say they knew from the beginning\u000athat Janet Summerhayes never would do in a situation; that she had been\u000atoo much spoiled ever to get on in a place where she had to consider\u000aother people and not herself, and that they were quite convinced she\u000awould soon turn up to be a burden on the good Blands, who were foolishly\u000akind to her.
p12328
aVRather any self-denial, Janet said to herself, than\u000aencounter this?
p12329
aVSo she restrained her alarms, kept a careful eye upon\u000aall the dark corners when she went up or downstairs, always carried a\u000alight with her wherever she went, and determined to say nothing,\u000awhatever might happen, so long as she could bear it.
p12330
aVIn this way she\u000akept herself calm, although she could not divest herself of an alarmed\u000aexpectation and sense that at any moment she might be startled into\u000aoverpowering terror again.
p12331
aVAnother consequence, however, followed, which she did not become aware\u000aof at once, yet which was of more practical importance--and that was\u000athat her presence in the drawing-room in the long evenings was not so\u000amuch a matter of course as it had been.
p12332
aVThe little dinner-parties, at\u000awhich the guests consisted only of Mr. Charles Meredith and one other\u000aman, or sometimes of Mr. Charles Meredith (as she discovered) alone,\u000atook place more frequently, and it was occasionally discovered by Miss\u000aHarwood or her mother that Julia ought to prepare her lessons better in\u000athe evening, which meant, of course, the exclusion of Miss Summerhayes\u000atoo.
p12333
aVWhen Janet saw that this had become a system she was, of course,\u000adisturbed by it; but she was so reasonable that she did not take\u000aoffence, as some young women might do.
p12334
aVShe concluded, on the whole,\u000aafter the first prick of annoyance, that it was quite a natural thing,\u000aand one that she had no right to complain of.
p12335
aVMiss Harwood liked to have\u000aher suitor (if he was her suitor) to herself.
p12336
aVShe did not want a third\u000aperson coming in between them, especially a third person who, in one\u000aparticular at least, surpassed herself.
p12337
aVJanet acknowledged that it was\u000aquite natural.
p12338
aVIn such circumstances she too, she felt, would invent\u000areasons why the other girl should not come downstairs, why she should\u000anot be allowed to interfere.
p12339
aVIt was a pity, and she did not like it.
p12340
aVIt\u000awas dull with Julia in the school-room, and not to be able to note how\u000athe play was going was a disappointment.
p12341
aVBut she behaved herself like a\u000alittle heroine, and did not complain.
p12342
aVIt certainly did not occur to her,\u000aat this period of her history, that to be prevented from improving her\u000aacquaintance with Charles Meredith was a grievance of which, even to\u000aherself, she could complain.
p12343
aVIt happened to her, however, during this period, when again she had\u000avolunteered to match crewels for Mrs. Harwood, on a day when nobody else\u000awas going out, to meet Meredith exactly as she had done when she saw him\u000afirst.
p12344
aVShe had run into the little shop on her mission--the St. John\u2019s\u000aWood shop, with all its little merchandises, like a superior village\u000arepository: and there, once more, exactly in the same spot, looking over\u000athe music, was the now well-known figure, correct yet easy in his\u000amorning suit, with his black hair and dark eyes and waxen bloom.
p12345
aVThe old\u000aladies in the shop thought Mr. Meredith a model of manly beauty, and\u000aeven Janet could not refrain from an involuntary glance of satisfaction.
p12346
aVShe was half-ashamed this time of having thought that he was like a\u000abarber\u2019s block.
p12347
aVAnd his eyes lighted up with such evident pleasure at\u000athe sight of her that it would have been impossible for a little girl\u000along abstracted from any look of admiration not to be pleased.
p12348
aV\u201cCome and help me to choose a new song for to-night,\u201d he said, after a\u000awarm greeting.
p12349
aV\u201cI have not seen you for a fortnight, Miss Summerhayes.
p12350
aVI\u000ahope we shall meet to-night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot if you are coming to dinner,\u201d said Janet, demurely; \u201cwe do not come\u000adown to dinner when there is company, Julia and I.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, that is the explanation?\u201d said Meredith, and, with a widening of\u000ahis eyes and elevation of his eyebrows, he added, \u201cThen I shall not come\u000ato dinner to-night.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet said nothing, for what had she to say?
p12351
aVShe had no part in these\u000aarrangements of her superiors.
p12352
aVShe gave a glance at the song he held in\u000ahis hand.
p12353
aV\u201cIt would be better to practise those you have than to bring anything\u000anew.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh, if you could persuade her of that!
p12354
aVand if we singers could be left\u000afree to think of the song without hammering at the accompaniment!
p12355
aVHow\u000awell you play, Miss Summerhayes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI can do nothing else,\u201d said Janet; \u201cI was taught only for that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes,\u201d said Meredith, \u201cthat is the right way--to do one thing well, and\u000astick to it; but, unfortunately, everybody is not of that opinion.
p12356
aVMost\u000aladies think that they can do anything--or, at least, try.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo more than most men,\u201d said Janet, quickly.
p12357
aV\u201cOh, don\u2019t you think so?
p12358
aVI think you\u2019ll allow we\u2019ve a different way of\u000asetting to work.
p12359
aVWe do what we can, what we have studied; but you ladies\u000atry a little of everything without having studied at all.
p12360
aVMiss Harwood\u000ahas a nice little voice, but no science even in that, and she knows no\u000amore of the piano than of the steam-engine.
p12361
aVDon\u2019t contradict me, Miss\u000aSummerhayes, for I am sure I must know best.
p12362
aVI have suffered from it too\u000amuch.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have no appearance of suffering at all,\u201d said Janet.
p12363
aV\u201cAh, that\u2019s all my power of dissembling,\u201d he said.
p12364
aVJanet had got her crewels by this time, and she had a vague\u000aconsciousness that it would be well not to continue this conversation,\u000aso she said, \u201cGood-morning!\u201d and was about to pass him on her way home\u000awhen he put out his hand to detain her.
p12365
aV\u201cMiss Summerhayes, don\u2019t run away.
p12366
aVI am going in the same direction.
p12367
aVWe\u000aare prevented from making friends in the evening, but I should not like\u000ato let an opportunity slip.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWho keeps us from making friends, Mr. Meredith?
p12368
aVYou are making a great\u000amistake.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAm I?
p12369
aVIf you think you know Gussy Harwood, it is you that are quite\u000amistaken, Miss Summerhayes.
p12370
aVHow quickly you walk; I can scarcely keep up\u000awith you.\u201d He laughed, and took a stride or two which made Janet\u2019s\u000aattempt to hurry away ridiculous.
p12371
aV\u201cThere is no harm in walking along the\u000asame pavement, even with a person you disapprove of.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t disapprove of--any one,\u201d said Janet.
p12372
aV\u201cOh, that is more than I bargained for.
p12373
aVYou must promise to play for me\u000ato-night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut you said you were not coming to-night,\u201d said Janet.
p12374
aV\u201cSo I did,\u201d he answered, laughing; \u201cbut never mind--not to dinner,\u000acertainly.
p12375
aVYou must promise me to play, and not to stop short all at\u000aonce, as you did the other night, whatever you may hear.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, did you hear it too?\u201d Janet cried, clasping her hands.
p12376
aV\u201cI don\u2019t think I heard anything.
p12377
aVThere are queer sounds sometimes about\u000athat Harwood house--and old Vicars is queer; don\u2019t you think so?
p12378
aVNever\u000amind, Miss Summerhayes, you and I have nothing to do with that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t understand what you mean,\u201d said Janet.
p12379
aV\u201cI have nothing at all\u000ato do with it; but you, who are a great friend of the family, and have\u000aknown them so long, you ought not to talk like that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat am I saying?\u201d said Meredith; \u201cthat you and I have nothing to do\u000awith the secrets of the family, if they have any.
p12380
aVIsn\u2019t that quite\u000atrue?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are not at all in the same position,\u201d said Janet, indignantly.
p12381
aV\u201cI am\u000aa stranger and the governess.
p12382
aVYou are their--dear friend.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Meredith laughed low, with vanity and self-complacence.
p12383
aV\u201cAm I a \u2018dear friend\u2019?--you flatter me very much, Miss Summerhayes--of\u000aJulia, for instance, who says the prettiest things about me.
p12384
aVI see\u000ayou\u2019ve been working in my favor, for she\u2019s no longer so uncivil as she\u000aused to be.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, Mr. Meredith, she means no harm; she\u2019s only so--so----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSincere,\u201d he said; \u201cso she is, and I am half sorry you have taught her\u000ato mend her ways: for she is less amusing when she behaves like other\u000apeople.
p12385
aVThe brother, too--but you\u2019ve not yet made acquaintance with the\u000acharming Dolff--I know what will happen to that young man before he has\u000abeen two days in the house.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat?\u201d cried Janet.
p12386
aVShe felt more than ever that the conversation was undesirable; but she\u000awas full of curiosity, and her companion had ways and modes of securing\u000athe feminine attention.
p12387
aVHe made great play with those eyes of his, which\u000aexpressed so much more than his words.
p12388
aVEven now he answered her question\u000awith them in a way which made Janet blush before he had said a word.
p12389
aV\u201cWhat will happen to him?
p12390
aVOh, I know; but I will not forestall the\u000apleasure of the discovery.
p12391
aVI suppose it\u2019s always more or less a pleasure\u000ato a young lady when she finds---- Oh, I am not going to say any more.
p12392
aVYou need not blush, Miss Summerhayes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am not blushing,\u201d cried Janet, angrily, feeling her countenance\u000ablaze.
p12393
aV\u201cOh, no, I see; it is only the effect of walking so quickly, which\u000abrings the most agreeable color to the cheek.
p12394
aVAbout Mr. Dolff, we shall\u000asee what we shall see.
p12395
aVBut keep your head, whatever you do, Miss\u000aSummerhayes, and we shall have some fun.
p12396
aVIt will be as good as a play.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are as good as a play,\u201d cried Janet, indignant, eager to give him a\u000aprick in return.
p12397
aV\u201cWho, I?\u201d He gave her a momentary stare, then laughed.
p12398
aV\u201cWe,\u201d he said; \u201cI\u000adon\u2019t pretend not to understand.
p12399
aVI daresay we give you a good deal of\u000aamusement as you sit and make your remarks.
p12400
aVI saw the very first night\u000awhat a keen pair of eyes had come into the scene.
p12401
aVBut do not be too sure\u000aof anything.
p12402
aVPeople who look on don\u2019t always see the whole of the game.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think I see a great deal of the game; and I don\u2019t like it at all,\u201d\u000aJanet cried.
p12403
aV\u201cYou don\u2019t like me at all, Miss Summerhayes.
p12404
aVAfter that home-thrust I\u000ahave nothing for it but to make my bow and take my leave.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER XIV.
p12405
aVMiss Harwood came into the drawing-room in the afternoon, at five\u000ao\u2019clock, when the little party were all assembled, with an open note in\u000aher hand.
p12406
aV\u201cFancy, mamma, how annoying,\u201d she said, \u201cCharley cannot come to dinner.
p12407
aVSome engagement, business, has turned up; and he says, since you kindly\u000aallow him to dispense with ceremony----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, I should think so,\u201d cried Mrs. Harwood.
p12408
aV\u201cLet him keep any business\u000aengagement, for goodness\u2019 sake.
p12409
aVHe has not too many of them, I fear.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe has more than you think,\u201d said Gussy.
p12410
aV\u201cHis time is far more taken up\u000athan you suppose.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, \u201che might have let us know sooner, and then I\u000ashould not have ordered those partridges.
p12411
aVGame is thrown away upon\u000awomen.
p12412
aVYou all like a chicken just as well.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ll tell cook,\u201d said Gussy, \u201cto put them aside for to-morrow; but I\u000adon\u2019t suppose he knew till the last moment.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet had been going on with her work very demurely, taking no notice,\u000afeeling somewhat guilty, yet recognizing with a throb of elation that\u000ashe was not the unimportant person they all thought her.
p12413
aVJanet was of\u000aopinion that it was best to have no secrets, for secrets have an\u000ainfallible certainty of being found out.
p12414
aVSo she lifted her voice at this\u000apoint and said,\u000a\u000a\u201cI saw Mr. Meredith in Mimpriss\u2019s when I was there for the crewels.
p12415
aVHe\u000awas choosing some music.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDid he tell you he was not coming?\u201d Gussy asked, somewhat breathlessly.
p12416
aV\u201cHe held up a song,\u201d said Janet, and said, \u201cThis is for to-night.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhich was quite true.
p12417
aVTo keep back a little is very different, she said\u000ato herself, from telling a fib.
p12418
aVAnd now any gossip might tell them she\u000ahad been seen with Mr. Meredith, and no harm could come.
p12419
aV\u201cAh!
p12420
aVyou see it must have been quite sudden, mamma.
p12421
aVDid you notice, Miss\u000aSummerhayes, what the song was?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI saw Tosti\u2019s name at the bottom of the page, but I did not look at it\u000amore closely,\u201d said Janet.
p12422
aV\u201cHe held it up to me while I was getting my\u000acrewels, and said something about your voice.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe should not speak of my voice or of me at all in a shop,\u201d said Gussy,\u000awith a bright look and an air of flattered grievance.
p12423
aVTo think that he\u000acould not refrain from speaking of her, even in a shop, to anybody whom\u000ahe might meet, was sweet to poor Gussy, as it was also sweet to blame\u000ahim, and resent his foolish, lover-like weakness.
p12424
aV\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u000asuppose it will be for to-morrow night.
p12425
aVI will tell cook about the\u000apartridges, mamma.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere could be no doubt that Janet felt a little guilty as she dressed\u000afor dinner--guilty and curious, too.
p12426
aVHe had said he should not dine,\u000abut he had meant to come all the same.
p12427
aVWould he come, after all?
p12428
aVand on\u000awhat pretence?
p12429
aVHow would he make it seem consistent with his business\u000aengagement?
p12430
aVWhat would he do?
p12431
aVIt was a curious question, and she could\u000anot help feeling that her _rle_ and that of Gussy were reversed, and\u000athat it was she who would listen for the step and the ringing of the\u000abell, though solely out of curiosity to know what would happen.
p12432
aVJanet\u000amade herself a little more smart than usual; she could scarcely have\u000atold why.
p12433
aVShe relaxed a little the profound gloom of her mourning.
p12434
aVThere\u000awas a little additional light in her eyes.
p12435
aVShe was curious, very\u000acurious, to know whether he would do it, and how he would do it.
p12436
aVHer\u000ainstinct was mischievous--perhaps a little malicious--a sort of\u000adrawing-room wickedness, mere fun, not anything else.
p12437
aVIt would be\u000ainteresting to see with what ingenuousness he would account for his\u000aunlooked-for appearance, how gravely he would recount the manner in\u000awhich he got rid of his business engagement.
p12438
aVJanet felt that she would\u000ahave difficulty in keeping her countenance while he ran through his\u000aexcuses.
p12439
aVAnd she realized to herself Gussy\u2019s serious attention, her\u000acongratulations to him on having been able to get away, and Mrs.\u000aHarwood\u2019s remark that she hoped he would never neglect any business\u000aengagement which was of importance.
p12440
aVJanet held her breath in\u000aanticipation, to keep down the laugh which she knew would try to come.
p12441
aVAnd he would look at her with audacious eyes, lifting his eyebrows,\u000aclaiming her as a fellow conspirator.
p12442
aVThere could be no doubt that it\u000awould be \u201cfun.\u201d All of them so serious, taking the matter in the gravest\u000away, while she would receive that glance aside, that reminder that they\u000awere in a plot together.
p12443
aVYet it was no plot.
p12444
aVJanet could truly say that\u000ashe had nothing, nothing to do with it.
p12445
aVIf he was so impudent as to\u000acheat his friends, it was no fault of hers: and no doubt it was very\u000awrong of him.
p12446
aVBut it was a piquant break upon the monotony, and Janet\u000acould not deny even to herself that the fun was uppermost, and that she\u000aexpected to be much amused.
p12447
aVIt all happened exactly as she had foreseen.
p12448
aVGussy took her place\u000aopposite her mother with the most absolute tranquillity.
p12449
aVHer usual\u000alittle strain of expectation, which was always there, even on the\u000aevenings when he was not expected, when it was only possible that he\u000amight come, had altogether fallen to-night.
p12450
aVShe looked at her work with\u000aeyes which had no other meaning, never held her breath at a passing\u000asound, nor paused to listen; became, indeed, again the mild Gussy,\u000aundisturbed by emotion, with whom Janet had first made acquaintance.
p12451
aVThe sight of this relapse into quietude gave Janet a great compunction;\u000amore even than had Miss Harwood shown acute disappointment; and she felt\u000ain herself, as she had foreseen, all the signs of the suspense and\u000aexpectation from which the other had escaped.
p12452
aVIn the stillness of the\u000anight she heard, or thought she heard, steps coming from a long\u000adistance: she caught her breath at every passing sound.
p12453
aVWhen a cinder\u000afell from the hearth, she gave a little jump, as if it were some one\u000acoming.
p12454
aVHer ears were keener than they had ever been in her life.
p12455
aVThe\u000asense of fun gave way in Janet\u2019s mind to a sense of guilt as she thus\u000alistened and watched in spite of herself.
p12456
aVAnd yet she had done nothing\u000awrong; the fault, she said to herself, if there was one, was not at all\u000aher fault.
p12457
aVBut Janet felt like a little conspirator, sitting there among\u000athem, knowing the surprise that was coming and that they were about to\u000abe deceived.
p12458
aVWhen nine o\u2019clock struck, however, which it did very audibly, in the\u000along pauses of conversation, Janet said to herself, half with relief and\u000ahalf with disappointment, that now he would not come.
p12459
aVGussy had closed\u000athe piano before dinner; there was no glimmer from the white keyboard.
p12460
aVThe evening was going to pass over quite tranquilly, like one of the\u000aquiet evenings before Mr. Charles Meredith appeared.
p12461
aVJust as she had concluded upon this, with, to do her justice, quite as\u000amuch relief as disappointment, the sudden sound of the bell came\u000atingling through the quiet, making Janet jump, who was off her guard.
p12462
aVGussy, who expected nothing, scarcely stirred.
p12463
aV\u201cWho can that be so late?\u201d said Mrs. Harwood: \u201cit can\u2019t be Charley\u000aMeredith to-night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt must be a parcel or something,\u201d said Gussy, \u201cor perhaps a telegram\u000afrom Dolff to say when he is coming.
p12464
aVHe is fond of telegrams--It is some\u000aone coming in,\u201d she said, after a pause, raising her head.
p12465
aV\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s Dolff himself,\u201d said Julia, getting up with one spring\u000afrom the rug.
p12466
aVShe rushed to the door, while they all watched.
p12467
aVJulia\u000aopened it, looked out, and closed it again with indignation.
p12468
aV\u201cAfter all,\u000ait\u2019s Charley Meredith again,\u201d said the young lady, \u201cand now, I suppose,\u000awe shall have to go to bed.\u201d\u000a\u000aGussy rose up, her quietness all gone.
p12469
aVShe said, \u201cAh!\u201d in an\u000aindescribable tone, as if coming from the bottom of her heart.
p12470
aV\u201cJu, how rude you are, shutting the door in his face!\u201d said Mrs.\u000aHarwood.
p12471
aV\u201cYou seem to wish to make the very worst impression, as if you\u000awere a savage.
p12472
aVWell, Charley!
p12473
aVthis _is_ a surprise.
p12474
aVWe made sure we\u000ashould not see you to-night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope it\u2019s not disagreeable,\u201d said Meredith, coming in briskly with\u000ahis roll of music, as usual.
p12475
aVHe managed, even in that first moment, to\u000agive a side glance at Janet, which she somehow caught trembling under\u000aher eyelids.
p12476
aVOh, it might be fun!
p12477
aVbut it was horrid, too.
p12478
aVShe felt\u000aherself a conspirator, a deceiver, all that was most dreadful, and did\u000anot dare to raise her eyes.
p12479
aVBut nothing could be more assured and easy\u000athan his explanation.
p12480
aV\u201cI found I could shake off my man sooner than I\u000aexpected.
p12481
aVTalks about business, don\u2019t you know, Mrs. Harwood--you ought\u000ato know--mean endless maundering on one side, and half-a-dozen words on\u000athe other.
p12482
aVIf your advice is worth anything, it can always be said in\u000ahalf-a-dozen words.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI would never hurry a client, Charley,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, shaking her\u000ahead; \u201cin all I\u2019ve had to do with the law I\u2019ve always seen that; and my\u000abrother, who, you know, was a Q.C., always said so.
p12483
aVNever hurry a\u000aclient; let them get it all out.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, I think he got it all out, and we parted the best of friends.
p12484
aVHe\u2019s\u000aonly in town for a few days, and he wanted to go to the theatre; so I\u000atook him to the \u2018Gayety,\u2019 and gave him my blessing.
p12485
aVAnd here I am, not\u000amuch later than usual.
p12486
aVI beg your pardon, Miss Summerhayes, I did not\u000asee you.
p12487
aVHow do you do to-night?\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat a look he gave her as, pretending to see her for the first time, he\u000amade a step in her direction.
p12488
aVGussy afterwards took him much to task for\u000aslighting the governess.
p12489
aV\u201cJust because she is the governess one ought to be more than usually\u000aattentive not to hurt her feelings,\u201d said Gussy.
p12490
aVBut, then, she did not see that look, which so tempted Janet to\u000alaughter, yet overwhelmed her with a sense of guilt.
p12491
aVHis eyebrows went\u000aup almost into his hair as he looked at Janet.
p12492
aVHe gave her the slightest\u000anod of understanding.
p12493
aV\u201cYou see!\u201d he seemed to say.
p12494
aVJanet felt herself\u000adrawn into his circle, made his comrade, his confidant.
p12495
aVAnd it _was_\u000afunny; but, oh, so horrid, too!
p12496
aV\u201cClients come, more or less,\u201d he said.
p12497
aV\u201cI am not quite so briefless as I\u000awas.
p12498
aVI think I may say I am getting on, and my devotion to my work is\u000aboundless.
p12499
aVI know how much depends upon it.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe gave Gussy a look as he said this, which caused two blushes instead\u000aof one, for the color came crimson to Janet\u2019s face as she stooped over\u000aher work, as well as in a soft rose to Gussy\u2019s colorless cheeks.
p12500
aV\u201cAh!
p12501
aVit\u2019s more music, I fear, than law,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, again\u000ashaking her head.
p12502
aV\u201cWell, both are best,\u201d said the young man, looking at Gussy again.
p12503
aV\u201cMusic gets me on in one way, law in the other.
p12504
aVI have to consider what\u000ais needed all round.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can always make out a good case for yourself, Charley.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope so, Mrs. Harwood; and for my clients, too.\u201d\u000a\u000aGussy was silenced by these allusions, which were so very plain.
p12505
aVHer\u000aeyes seemed to swim in a soft and liquid brightness.
p12506
aVHer face had the\u000arose-tint which makes up for all deficiencies in character and color.
p12507
aVThis evening, which had begun in resigned dulness, was it to end more\u000abrightly than any other?
p12508
aVShe was silent in the flood of silent happiness\u000athat filled her heart.
p12509
aVAnd Janet sat by, the little conspirator, who was\u000abehind the scenes and knew the difference!
p12510
aVOh, how wicked, how angry,\u000ahow helpless she felt!
p12511
aVIt was not fun at all, but treachery, a falsehood\u000athat made her ashamed to the very bottom of her heart; unless this,\u000aindeed, was the truth, and Janet the little dupe whom he was making a\u000afool of, which would be better than the other, yet even more\u000aexasperating.
p12512
aVShe kept her eyes fixed upon her work, and her needle\u000aflew, and her cheeks burned.
p12513
aVNever, never, never, thought Janet, would\u000ashe speak to Mr. Meredith again.
p12514
aVThere was at least half-an-hour spent in conversation, and then the\u000avisitor unrolled his new song.
p12515
aV\u201cI wish you would try this,\u201d he said; \u201cour concert is coming on, and we\u000amust settle what we are going to do.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGussy is to sing in the quartets,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood.
p12516
aV\u201cIn more than quartets.
p12517
aVShe is to perform a duet with me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, is that what you are thinking of?
p12518
aVIsn\u2019t it a little conspicuous?
p12519
aVThese things are all very well in a drawing-room--but on a public\u000aplatform!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMother--it is to amuse the poor.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, yes.
p12520
aVI know what you mean with your amusements for the poor.
p12521
aVYou\u000aamuse yourselves very much first of all, and then you call it an act of\u000acharity.
p12522
aVI am not a great person for amusing the poor.
p12523
aVIt would not\u000aamuse me at all to go out in a cold night and listen to your concert,\u000aand I don\u2019t think a woman of my age in the back slums would like it a\u000abit better.
p12524
aVWe would both prefer our fireside and our work.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut suppose the poor creature had no fire, Mrs. Harwood?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen give her some firing, which would be far more sensible.
p12525
aVShe wants\u000acoals, and you give her a song.
p12526
aVOf course you will do it your own way.
p12527
aVSinging to them is the fad of your generation.
p12528
aVCoals and groceries have\u000aalways been mine.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut about this duet,\u201d said Meredith, with an indulgent smile.
p12529
aV\u201cAs for it being conspicuous,\u201d said Gussy, \u201cthat is nonsense, mamma: for\u000apeople sing according as their voices suit, and not for any other\u000areason.
p12530
aVAnd Charley and I are such old friends.
p12531
aVWe surely may sing\u000atogether.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOr do anything else together,\u201d he said.
p12532
aV\u201cOh!
p12533
aVhave it your own way,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood.
p12534
aV\u201cIt is quite useless for\u000ame to interfere.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou mean a much more gracious permission, dear Mrs. Harwood, than you\u000asay.
p12535
aVAh!
p12536
aVhere is Miss Summerhayes to play for us, if she will be so\u000agood.
p12537
aVAnd I think you will be so good, for nobody could play so well\u000awithout liking to do it.
p12538
aVNo, I can\u2019t have you bothered with that, Gussy.
p12539
aVYou must give your whole attention to the song.
p12540
aVCome!
p12541
aVWhy, the piano is\u000ashut up, and there are no lights.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou forget,\u201d said Gussy, \u201cwe did not expect you to-night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd you never have any music except when I am here!
p12542
aVThat is a pity,\u000athough it\u2019s a great compliment.
p12543
aVMay I light the candles?
p12544
aVNow, come--it\u000ais to be a lesson to-night.
p12545
aVMiss Summerhayes will play, and I shall\u000acoach, and correct, and do all sorts of dreadful things, as if I were\u000aCantalino.
p12546
aVYou shall have everything over again that Cantalino inflicts\u000aupon me.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn this way, with every kind of seduction, Gussy was got to the piano,\u000aand received her lesson, which was half a gratification and half the\u000areverse, for Miss Harwood did not quite like to be put in the place of a\u000alearner before Janet, while it made her happy to be \u201ccoached,\u201d and\u000atrained, and interrupted, praised, and encouraged by her lover.
p12547
aVWas he\u000aher lover?
p12548
aVJanet seated with her back to them, with a new and difficult\u000aaccompaniment to occupy her fingers, could not resolve this question to\u000aherself; sometimes men are not at all loyal and yet are in love.
p12549
aVThey\u000adiscuss their beloved one, or even their _fiance_, with the first\u000acomer.
p12550
aVThey ask other men\u2019s opinion of her.
p12551
aVThey talk of their own\u000aexecution, when they are to be \u201cturned off,\u201d and similar vulgarities,\u000aand yet are lovers in the curious contradiction of nature.
p12552
aVWas this all?
p12553
aVWas his criticism of Gussy only his unmeaning banter?
p12554
aVand his joke\u000aplayed upon her to-night, did it mean nothing?
p12555
aVJanet sat at the piano, and thumped and pondered, with her cheeks\u000ablazing crimson and her hands flying from one end of the instrument to\u000aanother.
p12556
aVShe was a very good accompanist.
p12557
aVShe might not, perhaps, have\u000aany instinct of self-sacrifice in life, but she had learnt that it was\u000aof the first importance in art.
p12558
aVShe played for the singer, not for\u000aherself, supporting her in her weak notes, giving place to her strong\u000aones, making her own performance the background of the other.
p12559
aVAnd, as\u000aJanet felt much ashamed of herself and of the part which she had been\u000amade to play in this night\u2019s performance, she was more self-sacrificing,\u000amore bent upon making herself secondary and the singer first than ever.
p12560
aVWhen the singing was over, even Mrs. Harwood applauded.
p12561
aV\u201cYou should always have Miss Summerhayes to play your accompaniments,\u000aGussy.
p12562
aVShe does it beautifully.
p12563
aVShe brings out your voice as I never\u000aheard it before.
p12564
aVI begin to think that no one can sing and play too.
p12565
aVYou\u000abrought out her voice quite beautifully, Miss Summerhayes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA word of applause for the coach, too,\u201d said Meredith, with a laugh.
p12566
aVGussy, pleased with her little success, stood, with an uneasy glance at\u000aJanet, not knowing what to say.
p12567
aVShe was more disposed to applaud the\u000acoach than the little governess.
p12568
aVShe stood hesitating between them, now\u000aand then giving Janet a doubtful look.
p12569
aVShe was far too much assured in\u000aher own superior place to be jealous of Janet.
p12570
aVJealous of Janet!
p12571
aVShe\u000awould as soon have thought of being jealous of a cat.
p12572
aVBut still it\u000aannoyed her slightly that Janet should have such a share even in this\u000alittle drawing-room triumph.
p12573
aVCHAPTER XV.
p12574
aVJanet was not at all satisfied with herself after this performance.
p12575
aVShe\u000aunderstood, if nobody else did, the attitude of Gussy towards her; the\u000ahalf-defiance, half-sympathy, and entire doubtfulness with which the\u000ayoung lady of the house began to regard her.
p12576
aVAll the events of the\u000aevening, taken together, had given Miss Harwood a sensation of doubt.
p12577
aVShe was not clever enough to put one thing to another, and divine that\u000athere was a connection between the meeting with Meredith and the sudden\u000aengagement which prevented him from coming to dinner, and his\u000aunexpected appearance at night; but she had a vague feeling of doubt,\u000awhich originated in the instinct of her emotions rather than in any\u000aexercise of reflection.
p12578
aVShe blamed neither of them, unless, indeed, a\u000afaint sensation of displeasure, too little to deserve that name, towards\u000aJanet could be called blame.
p12579
aVShe thought that the governess wished to be\u000aof the party, to thrust her services upon them, to share the amusement\u000awithout consideration that something more than amusement was beneath.
p12580
aVHer mind did not go any further than this, but it gave her a slight\u000asoreness towards the other girl, who did not understand--a soreness\u000amodified by a kind of uneasy gratitude to Janet for having really served\u000aher after all.
p12581
aVWhatever her motive was, Janet in her compunction for her\u000abehavior altogether (though, after all, there was nothing for which she\u000acould blame herself, the fault lay entirely with the other, or almost\u000aentirely), was, after this, very anxious to put herself at the service\u000aof Gussy.
p12582
aVShe put aside occupations of her own to play these\u000aaccompaniments again and again.
p12583
aVShe it was who urged upon Miss Harwood\u000athe unceasing practice which was necessary to bring her song to\u000aperfection.
p12584
aV\u201cIt is so different when you are standing up before a crowd of people,\u000aand it all seems to float away from you; so different from singing at\u000ahome.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen you have done it yourself?\u201d said Gussy, surprised.
p12585
aV\u201cOh, only at our little concerts at Clover, where I knew everybody: and\u000aI only played, which is not nearly so bad; but I have seen people who,\u000afor a minute, forgot everything, and looked as if they would run away.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think I shall want to run away,\u201d said Miss Harwood, with\u000adignity.
p12586
aV\u201cOh, no, I didn\u2019t suppose so; but you will feel so much more comfortable\u000aif you know your song well.
p12587
aVShall we go over it once again?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is very kind of Miss Summerhayes,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, feeling a want\u000aof warmth in her daughter\u2019s reception of this generous offer.
p12588
aV\u201cIt is\u000avery nice of her,\u201d the old lady added, \u201cfor it can\u2019t matter a bit to\u000aher.
p12589
aVIt is not as if she were teaching you, when she might get some\u000acredit from it.
p12590
aVIt is entirely good feeling.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am sure I am--much obliged to Miss Summerhayes,\u201d said Gussy.
p12591
aVAnd she\u000awas aware that what her mother said was quite true.
p12592
aVShe was not an\u000aimpulsive person in general, but a sudden movement of remorse for her\u000aown ingratitude and appreciation of the other\u2019s unselfishness seized her\u000aall at once.
p12593
aV\u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy we should go on calling her\u000aMiss Summerhayes when she has been three months in the house, and always\u000aso nice.
p12594
aVI am sure she would prefer it, mamma, if you at least were to\u000acall her Janet; and it is a pretty name, too; not like our solemnities\u000ain the Harwood family.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet was taken very much by surprise.
p12595
aVShe was not quite sure that she\u000awas so much gratified as she expected to be, and it took her a certain\u000aeffort to get up the little burst of pleasure and gratitude which was\u000abecoming.
p12596
aVIt is a sad thing to be expected to be grateful for a favor\u000awhich does not appear to yourself in that light.
p12597
aVJanet had always been\u000acalled Janet by everybody all her life, so that she rather preferred at\u000apresent to be Miss Summerhayes.
p12598
aVHowever, she succeeded in assuming the\u000aair of delighted surprise which was necessary in the circumstances, and\u000awhen Mrs. Harwood kissed her, and said, with her motherly smile, \u201cI\u000ashall like so much to call you Janet, my dear,\u201d the genuine kindness\u000atouched her heart.
p12599
aV\u201cI hope I shall never do anything to vex this dear old lady,\u201d she said\u000ato herself.
p12600
aVThe silent prayer was not realized, but still it may be put on record as\u000aa real moment of feeling in Janet\u2019s very contradictory little being.
p12601
aVShe\u000awas very uncertain what Gussy could mean in thus opening to her the\u000agates of intimacy, and receiving her, as it were, on a new footing.
p12602
aVWhat\u000adid she mean by it?
p12603
aVBut Miss Harwood herself could not have told.
p12604
aVShe\u000ameant a momentary compunction, a half-apology, and to compensate the\u000agirl a little for the involuntary doubt she had of her.
p12605
aVIf there was\u000aanything more in it, Gussy herself was unconscious of further motive.
p12606
aVIt\u000awas something in the nature of a penance, no doubt; for Miss Harwood\u000aloved the governess a trifle less as Janet, in the intimacy of the\u000aclosest intercourse, than she had done as a stranger and Miss\u000aSummerhayes.
p12607
aVThus a vague mist of feeling rose between the two which did not in any\u000away interfere with their present relations, and was, in fact, founded\u000aupon almost nothing, yet was full of undeveloped elements in which\u000amischief might lie; while all around this nebulous region of uncertain\u000asentiment shone the easy light of the household, untroubled by any mist,\u000aa sober, steady glow, not excessive, of good-humor and kindness, chiefly\u000aproceeding from the mild moon or household lamp of Mrs. Harwood, which\u000areflected many different colored rays, reducing them, by the action of a\u000asteady, pleasant, good disposition, taking all things soberly and\u000akindly, to a light which was warm without extravagance, and bright\u000awithout dazzling.
p12608
aVHow happy were all her friends in Clover to hear that\u000aJanet had thus \u201cfallen on her feet!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe vicar called at the house in St. John\u2019s Wood about this time, and\u000acarried back the most delightful report with him.
p12609
aVThe impression he\u000ahimself produced was the best possible, for he was a handsome old\u000agentleman, and perfect type of a country vicar, well got up and\u000awell-to-do.
p12610
aVMrs. Harwood was anxious that he should come back to dinner,\u000aand would have liked to pay him a great deal of attention, and Janet\u000arose in everybody\u2019s opinion, from that of the head of the house down to\u000aPriscilla, the parlor-maid, and Owen, the gardener, to whom Mr.
p12611
aVBland\u000agave a shilling for calling a cab for him.
p12612
aVThe vicar assured Mrs. Harwood that he and his wife felt towards little\u000aJanet as if she were a child of their own.
p12613
aVAnd when he went back to\u000aClover he assured an anxious party assembled at afternoon tea that he\u000ahad seldom been more favorably impressed than by the charming family\u000awith whom Janet had found a home.
p12614
aV\u201cA delightful, refined house, an admirable mother, and a charming young\u000alady, quite the sort of friend I should have chosen for Janet, I\u000ascarcely saw her pupil, but I have no doubt, judging by all that I did\u000asee, that she was a sweet child, and worthy of the rest.
p12615
aVNo\u000acomplications such as so often beset a young girl\u2019s path; indeed, I\u000ashould say that if we had chosen from one end of the country to the\u000aother we could scarcely have selected anything so desirable as\u000aProvidence has procured for her--by chance, as we say.
p12616
aVIt is a lesson to\u000ame of trustfulness and dependence upon a higher guidance.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe ladies were all deeply edified with this speech, feeling that what\u000athe vicar said, especially about Providence, was beautiful: and when\u000athey heard that Janet was called by her Christian name, there was a\u000auniversal chorus of satisfaction.
p12617
aVDr. Harding, who had come in as he\u000apassed on his afternoon round, said \u201cHumph!\u201d behind their backs, shaking\u000ahis head; but then he, as we are all aware, had reasons for thinking\u000avery ill of Janet\u2019s foolish determination to measure her little strength\u000aagainst the world.
p12618
aVThe concert took place shortly after the vicar\u2019s visit, and Janet and\u000aher pupil, in the charge of a neighbor, Mrs. Hunter, from next door--as\u000aMrs. Harwood was unable to take care of them herself--were present,\u000ahappy spectators of Gussy\u2019s success: for the duet was quite the success\u000aof the evening, everybody said.
p12619
aVAnd the pair appeared on the platform\u000atogether, with a little halo of romance about them, a pair of lovers,\u000aas the audience believed, though nothing was as yet announced, or\u000apositively known.
p12620
aV\u201cOf course, we shall soon hear that it is all settled,\u201d the friends of\u000athe family said to each other.
p12621
aV\u201cHe is never out of the house, and\u000asinging together night after night; there is only one way in which that\u000asort of thing can end.\u201d\u000a\u000aSome thought that Gussy Harwood, who would have a very tolerable\u000afortune, should have secured something better than a briefless\u000abarrister.
p12622
aVBut others added that Charley Meredith had very good\u000aconnections, and knew a number of solicitors, and was a pushing sort of\u000aman, one of those who always get on.
p12623
aVAnd they looked very well together,\u000aquite a model couple; she so fair, almost too fair, but very well\u000adressed to-night in a dark dress, which threw up her fairness and\u000aneutralized her want of color; and he, on the contrary, with so much\u000acolor, such dark hair and mustaches, and such a fine bloom.
p12624
aVThe natural\u000aattraction of opposition could not have been more pleasantly set forth.
p12625
aVJanet sat in her place among the audience, and looked at them with eyes\u000aa little--just a little--envious, yet pleased to shine in the reflected\u000aglory.
p12626
aVThe dark dress which was so successful was her doing.
p12627
aVShe had\u000awanted Gussy to look her best, with a certain _esprit de corps_ and\u000adesire for the credit of the house: and it was she who, with much ado,\u000ahad persuaded both mother and daughter that the pale dresses in which\u000aMiss Harwood delighted would be out of place.
p12628
aVAlso it was she who had\u000atrained her in her song.
p12629
aVIt would not have been half so good but for\u000aJanet\u2019s painstaking, and her determination to have it fully practised.
p12630
aVJanet sat all impatient not to be on the platform along with them,\u000alonging for an occasion to show herself, half-believing to the very last\u000athat there would arise a commotion among the performers, and that some\u000aone would walk down the room to where she sat to ask if she would kindly\u000acome and accompany Mr. Meredith and Miss Harwood in their duet.
p12631
aVShe kept\u000aon expecting this until the very moment when they stood up, and the\u000apianist who had accompanied everybody struck the first notes.
p12632
aVOh!
p12633
aVsaid\u000aJanet to herself, impatient, what a mistake they were making!
p12634
aVThe\u000apianist was a nobody, and did not know their voices, and could not half\u000abring them out.
p12635
aVIf only she had been there!
p12636
aVBut she had to sit quiet and\u000alisten, which is very hard when you know that you could do it much\u000abetter.
p12637
aVJanet was not thinking of Mr. Meredith any more than if he had been a\u000acabbage, but she did want to share the triumph, she who had really\u000abrought it about, and she wanted to do what she could do so well instead\u000aof the inferior performer who did not do it half so well.
p12638
aVBut this is a\u000atrouble which accomplished persons must put up with continually, and\u000aafter the first mortification was over Janet sat it out bravely, and\u000aeven led the applause with a most energetic pair of hands, at the points\u000awhere it ought to come in, and was most wanted to stimulate failing\u000acourage or cover a weak point.
p12639
aVIn this she behaved with the utmost\u000agenerosity and desire that, notwithstanding their neglect of herself,\u000athe performance should succeed; and she listened to all the remarks with\u000aeager attention, especially those about the one way in which things of\u000athis kind must end.
p12640
aVWas this the way in which Gussy\u2019s romance was\u000acertain to end?
p12641
aVJanet felt that she herself would not be nearly so much\u000ainterested, not to say excited by it, if the conclusion was as certain\u000aas people thought.
p12642
aVBut she perceived clearly that if it did not end so\u000ait would be wrong, and Mr. Meredith much to blame.
p12643
aVThe drama altogether\u000awas breathless in its interest to this little spectator, because she\u000afelt that there was no certainty in it--that probably Mr. Charles\u000aMeredith was (so to speak, in the language of the stage) a villain, and\u000aGussy, perhaps, a victim.
p12644
aVWho could tell?
p12645
aVIt appeared, however, that\u000aJanet herself was the only person who had any doubt on the subject, and,\u000aan inexperienced little guesser as she was, how was she to know?
p12646
aV\u201cDo you think Gussy and Charley are in love with each other?\u201d said Julia\u000asuddenly, on their way home.
p12647
aV\u201cJulia!
p12648
aVone doesn\u2019t talk of such things till--till they are publicly\u000aknown.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFor I don\u2019t,\u201d said Julia.
p12649
aV\u201cGussy, yes, she is too silly.
p12650
aVI could kill\u000aher when she looks at him so; but, Charley, no--and he\u2019s the most\u000aimportant of the two, isn\u2019t he, Miss Summerhayes?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t know why he should be the most important; they are both equally\u000aimportant,\u201d said Janet, in her _rle_ of governess; \u201cbesides, it is not\u000aour business to discuss any such matter.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh!
p12651
aVthat is all bosh,\u201d said Julia.
p12652
aV\u201cOf course, I must discuss it when\u000ait\u2019s my own sister.
p12653
aVI\u2019ll tell you what I think.
p12654
aVHe has not made up his\u000amind; he thinks he\u2019ll do it, and then something makes him think that\u000ahe\u2019ll not do it.
p12655
aVHe knows that whenever he likes to put out his hand\u000aGussy will----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJulia, I can\u2019t let you talk so.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhether I talk or not, I know it all the same,\u201d said Julia.
p12656
aV\u201cI hate\u000aCharley Meredith, with his red cheeks.
p12657
aVI can\u2019t think what she sees in\u000ahim; but, though I could kill her for being so silly, I don\u2019t want our\u000aGussy to be disappointed.
p12658
aVI should like him to propose and her to\u000arefuse him; but, oh!
p12659
aVI\u2019m afraid there is not the least chance of that.
p12660
aVDo you think a girl should accept the very first offer, Miss\u000aSummerhayes?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think at all on the subject,\u201d said Janet.
p12661
aVShe paused, and gave a little laugh, not a sigh, which would have been\u000amore appropriate, to the memory of Dr. Harding, who had procured her\u000athat gratification.
p12662
aV\u201cOh, nonsense!\u201d cried Julia; \u201cwhy do you laugh?
p12663
aVYou were thinking of\u000asomeone, Miss Summerhayes.
p12664
aVLook!
p12665
aVthere\u2019s a light in the room over the\u000aporch.
p12666
aVDon\u2019t you see?\u201d The girl gripped her instructress by the arm.
p12667
aV\u201cLook, look, Miss Summerhayes; don\u2019t you see?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t be so excited,\u201d said Janet.
p12668
aV\u201cI see perfectly well: but I don\u2019t\u000aknow why you should excite yourself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, wait a bit!\u201d said Julia; \u201cwait a bit, and you\u2019ll be excited too.
p12669
aVYou don\u2019t know what it means yet.
p12670
aVJanet--I\u2019m going to call you Janet\u000anow--I\u2019m so glad.
p12671
aVWhy, Dolff must have come home--that means Dolff!\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd Julia suddenly flung off from Janet\u2019s side, and fled along the road\u000alike an arrow from the bow.
p12672
aVCHAPTER XVI.
p12673
aVJanet had no very strong curiosity about Dolff.
p12674
aVWhat she had heard of\u000ahim had not been calculated to rouse her interest, and still less the\u000aphotographs about the house in which Dolff appeared in every phase of\u000aboyhood and early manhood: for he was still very young, only two\u000aand-twenty, and consequently a mere boy to Janet, who was closely\u000aapproaching her twentieth birthday.
p12675
aVShe had no interest in young boys.
p12676
aVManhood, in Janet\u2019s estimation, did not begin till twenty-five at\u000aearliest, and before that period the male youth, who could not in any\u000away be taken seriously, was always more or less objectionable, she\u000alingered a little in the hall, and then she said to herself that it\u000awould be better to go upstairs at once, and not disturb the family\u000areunion.
p12677
aVSounds of a loudish voice, bass and rough, an altogether new\u000atone in this feminine house, and of a laugh still louder, came from the\u000adining-room, when Julia rushed in.
p12678
aVPriscilla, when she came out, had a\u000ademure smile upon her face.
p12679
aVThere was a little air of excitement about\u000athe house, a portmanteau still standing in a corner of the hall,\u000agreatcoats and railway-rugs, and railway-novels thrown about.
p12680
aV\u201cI don\u2019t think I shall go in to-night,\u201d Janet said to the parlor-maid.
p12681
aV\u201cMrs.
p12682
aVHarwood must want to have her son to herself.
p12683
aVWill you send me up\u000asome little thing by Jane, and I shall not come down again to-night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, miss,\u201d said Priscilla, \u201cI hope you will go in.
p12684
aVMr. Dolff is a most\u000aaffable young gentleman, he wouldn\u2019t wish to keep anybody away.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPlease do as I say,\u201d said Janet, running upstairs.
p12685
aVIt may be supposed that the description of Dolff as an affable young\u000agentleman who would not mind the governess\u2019s appearance did not mend\u000amatters.
p12686
aVWhen she went in with her candle into her room to take off her\u000ahat and the large shawl which she had wrapped round her over her evening\u000adress, Janet could not help seeing a piquante little face, which glanced\u000aat her carelessly from the dark depths of the glass.
p12687
aVHer black dress was\u000aa little open at the throat, and amid all the surrounding dark her\u000athroat was of a dazzling whiteness, and her eyes shone with the\u000aexcitement of the evening, and many thoughts that were careering through\u000aher mind.
p12688
aVJanet did not stop to admire herself, but the glance made her\u000arealize more deeply the contrast of her circumstances with those of\u000aGussy, who would come in presently accompanied by Charley Meredith and\u000areceive all the applause.
p12689
aV\u201cThough she would never have done it but for me,\u201d Janet said to herself.
p12690
aVShe had much wanted to see them after they came home, to watch how they\u000alooked at each other, and whether they would take any notice of the good\u000aeffect of her teaching.
p12691
aVAnd, therefore, it was with a little sigh that\u000ashe sat down at the school-room fire, and contented herself with the\u000asolitude which was her legitimate surrounding, and in which she was far\u000amore safe from any snubs or disappointments than elsewhere.
p12692
aVShe was prepared not to like Dolff.
p12693
aVEven Mr. Meredith\u2019s malicious\u000aprophecy of what \u201cwould happen\u201d had increased her prejudice against the\u000ason of the house.
p12694
aVJanet had not that admiration of an Oxford man which\u000ais common among young ladies.
p12695
aVHe was of the least agreeable kind which\u000athat refined university produces, she judged by the sound of his voice;\u000aand to have him hanging about \u201cpaying attention\u201d to the governess, for\u000asomething to occupy the spare time that would hang heavily on his hands,\u000awas an anticipation that made Janet furious.
p12696
aVWhen Julia came up, full of\u000aexcitement and news of her brother, Janet was so deeply occupied with\u000athe book she was reading as to pay scarcely any attention.
p12697
aV\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come in,\u201d said the girl.
p12698
aV\u201cDolff wanted to see you much\u000amore than me.
p12699
aVHe has heard so much about you.
p12700
aVHe was so disappointed.
p12701
aVHe wanted me to go up and bring you down.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow good that was of Mr. Harwood; but I can\u2019t be brought down to be\u000ashown like a new cat,\u201d said Janet, glancing over the top of her book.
p12702
aV\u201cOh, Janet, how unkind!\u201d said Julia; \u201cDolff is not a boy like that.
p12703
aVHe\u000amay not be quite serious, nor work as he ought, but he always was a nice\u000aboy.
p12704
aVAnd Gussy came back all in a glow.
p12705
aVThey had been praising her so.
p12706
aVBut mamma said you ought to get at least half the credit, and so Charley\u000aMeredith thinks too.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh!\u201d said Janet, coldly.
p12707
aVShe relapsed into her book, which she declared to herself was far more\u000ainteresting than all the Harwoods put together.
p12708
aVWhat a thing it is to\u000ahave a book to retire into when you are a little out of humor with your\u000asurroundings--a book full of romantic conditions in which you can\u000acompare how you would yourself have behaved with the manner in which the\u000aheroine behaved!
p12709
aVJanet sat up till midnight reading, till the fire went\u000aout, and all was silent in the house.
p12710
aVHer candles, too, were nearly\u000aexhausted before she perceived and started up in dismay to find one\u000aflickering in the socket, and to feel that the room was very chilly and\u000athe silence very eerie.
p12711
aVIt suddenly came into her mind how terrible it\u000awould be if at that moment, in the dead of night, the cry should come\u000aagain which had scared her so twice before.
p12712
aVWhen an idea of this kind\u000agets into one\u2019s mind at such an inappropriate moment it is very\u000adifficult to shake it off.
p12713
aVJanet hurried into her room to prepare for\u000abed, to get rid of the alarming suggestion.
p12714
aVHer room was next door to\u000athe school-room, and she stole out very quietly, not to disturb the dead\u000asilence.
p12715
aVBut when she came out upon the corridor with her little remnant\u000aof candle, she was startled to find that the house was not so dead\u000aasleep as she believed it to be.
p12716
aVA light was visible downstairs in the\u000ahall, and a stealthy sound as of some one moving about.
p12717
aVJanet looked over the bannisters with her heart beating, instantly\u000aasking herself what she should do if it turned out to be burglars\u000arobbing the house.
p12718
aVIt was, however, something quite different.
p12719
aVIt was\u000athe respectable man-servant whom she had already seen at long intervals,\u000awhose presence nobody explained, and whom Julia, the only one of the\u000afamily who had ever referred to him, called Vicars.
p12720
aVHe was going across\u000athe hall towards the part of the house which was called the wing,\u000acarrying a large tray.
p12721
aVThe candle which was on the tray shed its light\u000aupon sundry articles of food and a bottle or two of wine, which he was\u000acarrying very carefully, steadying as much as he could the little jar\u000aand tinkle of the dishes.
p12722
aVJanet looked down in great consternation at\u000athis unexpected scene.
p12723
aVHe went straight across the hall to a door which\u000aJanet had been told was done away with--the door that led to some rooms\u000awhich were never used--but which opened to Vicars at a touch, closing\u000aagain upon him and his trayful of food and his twinkling candle.
p12724
aVJanet watched him disappear with a chill of horror.
p12725
aVWhat did it mean?
p12726
aVWas he a thief who kept his spoils there?
p12727
aVWas he some secret enemy\u000ahanging about the house pillaging it in the dead of night?
p12728
aVAnd what, oh,\u000awhat ought she to do?
p12729
aVShould she rush into Mrs. Harwood\u2019s room and rouse\u000aher, or, at least, her maid?
p12730
aVShould she communicate at once the fact\u000athat there was a thief in the house?
p12731
aVThe thing that Janet did eventually\u000awas to retire hastily into her room and lock the door.
p12732
aVWhile the bit of\u000acandle lasted she made a hurried investigation, feeling it quite\u000apossible that some accomplice might be lurking under her own bed or\u000abehind her dresses in the wardrobe.
p12733
aVAnd then she jumped hastily into\u000abed, and covered herself over, so that at least, whatever dreadful thing\u000amight happen, she should not see.
p12734
aVBut nothing happened, dreadful or otherwise, and Janet awoke in the\u000amorning in her usual spirits, not remembering at first that anything had\u000aailed her on the previous night.
p12735
aVShe only came by degrees to recollect\u000athe last incident at the end of the others which occurred to her one by\u000aone as she opened her eyes upon the foggy, wintry December morning.
p12736
aVFirst of all, the concert, Gussy\u2019s singing, and the applause, which she\u000afelt was due to herself half as much at least as to the singer, and then\u000athe return home, Dolff\u2019s arrival, her own withdrawal upstairs, and\u000athen----\u000a\u000aShe sat suddenly bolt upright in her bed, with something of the shock of\u000athe previous night, and made up her mind that she would tell Mrs.\u000aHarwood, that it was her duty to prevent the house from being robbed;\u000aand, in the force of this idea, jumped out of bed and got through her\u000amorning preparations hastily, that no time might be lost.
p12737
aVBut before\u000aJanet saw Mrs. Harwood the impression once more had been effaced.
p12738
aVShe\u000aforgot in the morning aspect of the house that anything could happen in\u000ait that was not commonplace and ordinary.
p12739
aVGussy, who was the\u000ahousekeeper, and must know everything, had her keys in their little\u000abasket on the table before her, and Janet felt that to suggest any\u000atrickery in the house would be to offend that perfectly competent\u000adomestic ruler; and after all, what had the governess to do with it?
p12740
aVSo\u000aonce more she held her peace.
p12741
aVThe breakfast-table was, as usual, surrounded by the three active\u000amembers of the household--Miss Harwood, Julia, and the governess.
p12742
aVThe\u000anew-comer did not appear.
p12743
aV\u201cMy brother is always late, especially at first when he comes home,\u201d\u000asaid Gussy.
p12744
aV\u201cI don\u2019t suppose they get up very early at Oxford; but he\u000abehaves as if they did, as if he had to take a long rest when he gets\u000abeyond the reach of lectures.
p12745
aVYoung men are all lazy in the morning.
p12746
aVThey sit up half the night and waste their health.
p12747
aVThey never can stand\u000athe fatigue that women do.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDolff is always at his football and things--he is very strong; he is as\u000astrong as all of us put together,\u201d said Julia.
p12748
aV\u201cOh, yes, in that way,\u201d said Gussy.
p12749
aV\u201cI hope you liked the concert,\u000aJanet.
p12750
aVIt went off very well, don\u2019t you think, on the whole?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYour duet went off very well.
p12751
aVYou sang delightfully.
p12752
aVI was so pleased,\u000aso happy.\u201d\u000a\u000aA little flush came over Gussy\u2019s face.
p12753
aV\u201cIt is very nice of you to say so.
p12754
aVI saw you looking at me, and it kept\u000ame up, for you looked as if you were pleased.
p12755
aVIt was once suggested to\u000aask you to come and play, but I thought it would only make a fuss, and\u000athat you would not like it.
p12756
aVA fuss is what I cannot bear.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh!
p12757
aVI should not have minded,\u201d said Janet; \u201cbut,\u201d she added,\u000agenerously, \u201cit did not matter; it went very well as it was.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was once suggested!
p12758
aVJanet retired with her pupil to their lessons\u000awith this little revelation in her mind.
p12759
aVIt continued in hers that sense\u000aof being in the confidence of Mr. Charles Meredith, and knowing more\u000aabout him than Gussy did, to whom he was paying his court in all the\u000aforms, which was half-agreeable and half-humiliating to the governess.
p12760
aVShe would have no more of it, she said to herself.
p12761
aVHe ought to ask Gussy\u000ato marry him, and be done with it.
p12762
aVHe ought not to give those side\u000aglances, those unspoken avowals, to any one.
p12763
aVIt had been \u201cfun\u201d that\u000afirst time to think that he had upset all the arrangements, and\u000adisregarded everybody\u2019s convenience, and deceived his friends with\u000asmiling assurance for the sake of Janet.
p12764
aVIt was wrong, but it was\u000aamusing, and at twenty a mischievous pleasure in a trick of this sort is\u000anot out of date.
p12765
aVBut Janet felt now that it must not go on.
p12766
aVShe made up\u000aher mind not to go down to the drawing-room in the evening, or, at\u000aleast, not to be beguiled to the piano, nor to take any part.
p12767
aVIf the\u000aaccompaniment was spoiled, if Gussy did not do justice to her voice, if\u000athe duets were unsuccessful, what was that to Janet, any more than\u000aVicars with his laden tray going across the hall!
p12768
aVShe had thought that\u000aone of the amusing things in the life of a governess, as she had\u000apictured it to herself, would be this very spectatorship, the glimpses\u000abehind the scenes which she could not help having, seeing more of the\u000agame than the players did.
p12769
aVBut now it appeared that there were great\u000ainconveniences in the _rle_, and Janet made up her mind that she would\u000aplay it no more.
p12770
aVHer first sight of Dolff was in this wise.
p12771
aVWhen she came in with Julia\u000afrom their morning walk, blooming with health and fresh air, she found\u000athe Harwood family in the hall.
p12772
aVMrs. Harwood, in her chair, looking on\u000awith maternal smiles; Gussy on her knees before the opened portmanteau,\u000awhich had been left there on the previous night; and a young man with\u000ahis hat on, perched on the back of his head, seated upon the edge of a\u000atable, swinging his legs, and directing the process of unpacking.
p12773
aVHe was\u000aevidently in the happy position of one who was monarch of all he\u000asurveyed.
p12774
aVHe had come home to his kingdom: his vassals were ministering\u000ato him in various ways.
p12775
aVPriscilla, the parlor-maid, was gathering up an\u000aarmful of books to carry them away.
p12776
aVMrs. Harwood had got some gloves in\u000aher hand, which had evidently been given to her to mend.
p12777
aVDolff, with his\u000ahat on his head, and the suspicion of a cigar in the air, gave his\u000aorders lightly from his throne.
p12778
aVBut when the closing of the hall door, done somewhat loudly by Julia,\u000aaroused his attention, and he looked up to see a young lady unknown,\u000awith a bloom unknown to the house of Harwood on her cheeks, coming in,\u000aDolff started from that presiding seat, or, rather, slid from it, with a\u000amovement of consternation, and his hand stole up to his hat, removing it\u000awith evident embarrassment and confusion.
p12779
aVIt is to be supposed that he\u000ahad no idea at first that this was the governess of whom he had heard\u000amuch, but only officially under that name.
p12780
aVHis hat disappeared as if by\u000amagic, and he himself would have disappeared too, had that been possible\u000ain his abashed and troubled state.
p12781
aVHe looked at his mother helplessly,\u000afalling half behind her for protection.
p12782
aVJanet, it may be believed, was\u000anot abashed at all.
p12783
aV\u201cOh, this is Miss Summerhayes,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood.
p12784
aVShe thought, perhaps,\u000athat her son required no introduction in his own house.
p12785
aV\u201cAnd that\u2019s Dolff,\u201d said Julia, who was more conscious of the claims of\u000athe governess.
p12786
aVThe young man himself stood and grinned feebly, an image of confusion\u000aand shamefacedness.
p12787
aVJanet gave him a bow, a bow which was half a\u000acurtsey, with a sweep of grandeur in humility, excessive politeness\u000aintended to accentuate the informality of the presentation--and, having\u000asaid her good-morning to Mrs. Harwood, hurried upstairs.
p12788
aVThat was all so\u000afar as she was concerned, but it was far from being all for the\u000aunfortunate Dolff.
p12789
aV\u201cMother,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you tell me she was a swell like that?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou silly boy!
p12790
aVShe is no swell at all; but a nice little girl with, now\u000athat I think of it, a well-bred air.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cExcessively formal--for her situation in the world,\u201d said Gussy.
p12791
aV\u201cWell--I never thought of it before--she has very nice manners; but she\u000ahas been used to a good deal of attention, and perhaps----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou always spoil everybody, mamma.
p12792
aVJanet is very nice, but she does not\u000aquite know her own place.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s not the sort of person a fellow expects to see when he\u2019s told\u000athere\u2019s a new governess,\u201d said Dolff.
p12793
aV\u201cYou might have said something not\u000ato let me in for it like this.
p12794
aVShe\u2019ll think me a regular know-nothing,\u000aan ignorant cad; everything that\u2019s stupid.\u201d\u000a\u000aGussy looked up from the unpacking of the portmanteau, now nearly\u000afinished, with widely-opened eyes.
p12795
aV\u201cWhat can it possibly matter what Miss Summerhayes thinks of you?\u201d she\u000asaid.
p12796
aV\u201cOh,\u201d said Dolff, \u201cI don\u2019t see that!
p12797
aVWhy, she\u2019s a---- You mayn\u2019t mind,\u000abut I do.
p12798
aVLet a fellow in for looking as stupid as an owl, and as if he\u000adidn\u2019t know what\u2019s what, and then ask him what does it matter!
p12799
aVIt does\u000amatter to me.
p12800
aVI say, Ju, why didn\u2019t you tell me she was that sort?
p12801
aVI\u000anever felt more small in my life.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any occasion for it, Dolff,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood.
p12802
aV\u201cJanet\u2019s a very sensible girl; she knows exactly what to expect.
p12803
aVShe is\u000anot one of those that are always taking offence.
p12804
aVBesides, I don\u2019t see\u000athat any harm has been done.
p12805
aVYou took off your hat at once.
p12806
aVYou\u2019re very\u000acareless keeping it on and thinking no manners are necessary for your\u000aown people, Dolff, that I must say; but so far as concerns Miss\u000aSummerhayes----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, of course she thinks me a cad, and that\u2019s all about it,\u201d said the\u000ayoung man; \u201cand you don\u2019t care.
p12807
aVBut, as it happens, I do.
p12808
aVWhat is the\u000agood of having people belonging to you, if they can\u2019t keep you straight\u000ain a business like that?
p12809
aVOh, put the confounded things where you like,\u201d\u000asaid the young man, waving the books away which Priscilla held in her\u000aarms waiting for directions; \u201con the floor, or anywhere; I don\u2019t mind\u000aanything about your tidiness, but I do mind being shown off as a dashed\u000acad.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe took up his hat, and looked at it, as if that was the cause of\u000aoffence, then flung it on his head, and stalked out, careless of the\u000acalls that followed him.
p12810
aV\u201cWhere are you going, Dolff?\u201d his mother said, with a sudden shade of\u000aanxiety on her face.
p12811
aV\u201cMind that you are not late for lunch,\u201d said Gussy.
p12812
aVJulia put her arm through his, and accompanied him to the garden door.
p12813
aV\u201cDon\u2019t be long; oh, don\u2019t be long,\u201d said Julia.
p12814
aV\u201cCome out for a walk in\u000athe afternoon, Dolff, with her and me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t suppose she\u2019ll ever speak to me,\u201d said Dolff, shaking his\u000asister off: and he paused to take his pipe from his pocket, and light it\u000abefore he went forth, while all the ladies looked on through the open\u000ahall door.
p12815
aVThat he should go out with a round hat and a pipe in his\u000amouth was a trial of Gussy\u2019s patience, such as was very difficult to\u000aendure; and the knowledge that Dolff, when he disappeared in this way,\u000amight not, perhaps, come back till midnight wrung the heart of his\u000amother.
p12816
aVThe first day, too!
p12817
aVHe was not very much to look at, nor\u000aremarkable in any way, but he was of great importance to them.
p12818
aV\u201cIt is a mere pretext to get away to follow his own devices,\u201d said\u000aGussy, as she rose, red and angry, from her knees.
p12819
aV\u201cOh, Gussy, the first morning!\u201d said Mrs. Harwood.
p12820
aV\u201cI wish some one had\u000atold him; he is so particular about being well-bred, poor boy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, I have no patience with him,\u201d said Gussy, \u201cit is merely a pretence\u000ato get away.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER XVII.
p12821
aVThe fears of the household, however, were not justified.
p12822
aVDolff dutifully\u000acame home to lunch.
p12823
aVJanet, who, instead of being offended and dwelling upon his rudeness,\u000ahad not thought of him at all, save with a certain passing satisfaction\u000asuch as moves a woman involuntarily when she perceives that her own\u000aappearance has had the effect which it ought to produce--continued to be\u000aagreeably impressed during luncheon with the evident awe and admiration\u000awhich she elicited from the son of the house.
p12824
aVHe was very quiet, not\u000asaying much, civil to his sisters, evidently disposed to please.
p12825
aVHis\u000aappearance did not impress Janet.
p12826
aVHe was colorless, like the rest of his\u000afamily, with whiskers and a budding mustache, which, being very light,\u000ascarcely showed upon his face: and his form was wanting in those fine\u000aproportions which a girl\u2019s imagination requires in a hero--the length of\u000alimb and commanding height.
p12827
aVDolff was not short, but he was thick, which\u000aneutralized his real stature.
p12828
aVIt is impossible to describe how civil he\u000awas--to everybody, to Priscilla when she handed him the potatoes; even\u000ato Ju--whom he called Julia.
p12829
aVHe inquired how she was getting on with\u000aher--history.
p12830
aVEvidently he did not know what study he ought to inquire\u000ainto, but selected that as most dignified.
p12831
aVThis continued during the\u000awhole day; for Dolff, to the evident amazement of his family, came in\u000aagain at five o\u2019clock and drank tea and ate bread-and-butter in large\u000aquantities.
p12832
aV\u201cI did not think you ever took tea, Dolff,\u201d said his mother, amazed.
p12833
aV\u201cOh, I think it\u2019s very good for a fellow,\u201d said Dolff; \u201cbetter\u000athan--other drinks----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSo do I, my dear,\u201d cried his mother, fervently, and was about to make\u000afurther remarks, even perhaps to improve the occasion, had Gussy not\u000ainterposed with an imploring glance.
p12834
aVIn the evening he suggested a game of backgammon with his mother; the\u000apower of virtue could no further go.
p12835
aVThe ladies kept a close but\u000acarefully-concealed watch upon him, expecting the moment when he would\u000abreak loose, when he would exclaim that he must go out and get a little\u000aair, which generally meant that Dolff disappeared for the evening and\u000awas seen no more.
p12836
aVBut he endured like a man these hours of severe\u000adomesticity.
p12837
aVHe looked on while the ladies worked; he stood in front of\u000athe fire and told them stories of Oxford, condescending so far to their\u000ainferiority as to explain phrases and even to apologize for slang, as\u000awell as to throw in several passing biographies of \u201cmen\u201d from other\u000acolleges with whom he had formed alliances.
p12838
aVI could not assert\u000aauthoritatively that Mrs. Harwood, or even Julia, enjoyed these stories,\u000abut they all expressed the utmost interest, plied him with questions,\u000aand did everything that could be done to prolong the autobiographical\u000anarrative.
p12839
aVOccasionally a glance would pass between Mrs. Harwood and her\u000aelder daughter--a glance of wonder and satisfaction.
p12840
aVDolff had turned\u000aover a new leaf!
p12841
aVDolff had passed without apparent difficulty a long,\u000aunbroken evening at home.
p12842
aVThe next day Dolff continued in the same good dispositions.
p12843
aVHe even\u000aarranged his books in the little room that was called his study, and\u000aretired there for an hour or two to work, as he said.
p12844
aVThe ladies\u000ascarcely ventured to express their delight.
p12845
aV\u201cThere is no doubt that Dolff must have turned over a new leaf,\u201d said\u000aMrs. Harwood.
p12846
aV\u201cIt looks like it,\u201d said Gussy, \u201cbut we must not build much on the first\u000anight.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe second night, however, was even better than the first.
p12847
aVDolff made an\u000aoffer to Julia to help her with her--history, which made that young lady\u000aopen her eyes with consternation.
p12848
aV\u201cI\u2019ll come and give you a lecture, if you like--if Miss Summerhayes will\u000alet me,\u201d he said.
p12849
aV\u201cI\u2019m an awful dab at history.
p12850
aVThat\u2019s my subject, don\u2019t\u000ayou know.
p12851
aVI\u2019ve given up classics, and I\u2019m going in for history--does a\u000afellow far more good in the world.
p12852
aVI\u2019ll give you a course of lectures if\u000aMiss Summerhayes has no objection.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, no,\u201d cried Janet, demurely, bending her head over her work to hide\u000athe laugh which she could scarcely restrain: for it would have been\u000adifficult to imagine anything more unlike an academical lecturer than\u000aDolff as he stood, with his legs very wide apart, against the glowing\u000abackground of the fire.
p12853
aV\u201cIt would be to my own advantage as well as\u000aJulia\u2019s,\u201d she added, \u201cif Mrs. Harwood would not think it too much----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cToo much for--me?\u201d asked Dolff.
p12854
aV\u201cOh!
p12855
aVmother would be delighted to think\u000aI was doing something.
p12856
aVI\u2019ll come up to-morrow and see what you\u2019re\u000aabout.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, Dolff, I am sure it is very good of you,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood; \u201cbut\u000aI daresay what you learn at the University, where you have the first men\u000ato teach you, would perhaps be rather too much for a little girl.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh!
p12857
aVif that is all!
p12858
aVI think you might trust me, mother, to break it\u000adown into nice little scraps,\u201d cried Dolff.
p12859
aV\u201cIt would only waste Ju\u2019s time and keep her back from her--music and\u000aother things,\u201d said Gussy, suspicious, though she did not well know why.
p12860
aV\u201cOh, Gussy!--when you know you have always said I never should do\u000aanything in music,\u201d cried Julia, who saw prospects of fun and congenial\u000aidleness in Dolff\u2019s proposal.
p12861
aVJanet had suppressed her laugh, and was very grave over her needlework.
p12862
aVIt was not for her to interfere.
p12863
aV\u201cWe\u2019ll think it over,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood; \u201cyou don\u2019t always think the\u000asame in the morning as in the evening, my dear boy.
p12864
aVNo doubt it would be\u000afor Julia\u2019s advantage, for I don\u2019t think, any more than Gussy, that she\u000awill ever do much at her music.
p12865
aVI should like to see into it myself\u000afirst, and whether it wouldn\u2019t interfere with your time, and if you\u000aremain in the same mind, and so forth.
p12866
aVWe\u2019ll think it over, Dolff.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI never knew that the mother considered herself clever about history\u000abefore,\u201d said Dolff, with a laugh.
p12867
aV\u201cAnd what\u2019s all this about music?
p12868
aVI\u2019ve grown a great dab at music, too.
p12869
aVYou\u2019ve had the piano open these\u000atwo nights.
p12870
aVWho plays?
p12871
aVor sings, is it?
p12872
aVOh!
p12873
aVI suppose it\u2019s you, Gussy.
p12874
aVCome along and let us hear.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI seldom sing alone,\u201d said Gussy, with a blush.
p12875
aV\u201cWell, come and sing with me.
p12876
aVI\u2019m your man.
p12877
aVI\u2019ve grown quite a dab at it\u000athis term.
p12878
aVAnything to make the time pass.
p12879
aVI thought it was something\u000anew when I saw the piano standing open.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is nothing at all new, Dolff.
p12880
aVGussy has always had a very pretty\u000avoice.
p12881
aVShe is shy about it by herself, so she generally sings in duets\u000aor concerted pieces.
p12882
aVBut she has a very pretty voice, hasn\u2019t she,\u000aJanet?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAre you musical, Miss Summerhayes?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe has a very sweet voice,\u201d said Janet.
p12883
aV\u201cIt came out beautifully the\u000aother night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAre you musical, Miss Summerhayes?\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet paused, believing that some one would answer for her.
p12884
aVThen she\u000asaid.
p12885
aV\u201cI play a little occasionally.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou could rattle over a little accompaniment?\u201d said Dolff.
p12886
aV\u201cOh, it\u2019s\u000anot difficult--I could almost do it myself, only one can\u2019t play and sing\u000atoo.\u201d\u000a\u000aAgain Janet hesitated.
p12887
aVShe cast a glance round the silent company to\u000aknow what she was expected to do.
p12888
aVBut Mrs. Harwood gave no sign, and\u000aGussy was abstracted, listening for the step which did not come--and\u000awhich was so much more important than all the brothers in the world.
p12889
aV\u201cOh, yes, I think I could rattle over a little accompaniment,\u201d said\u000aJanet.
p12890
aV\u201cThen come along,\u201d cried Dolff, delighted.
p12891
aV\u201cI\u2019ll fetch some of my songs\u000ain a moment.
p12892
aVThey are not Gussy\u2019s sort, and she would not care to play\u000afor me, but the mother will like it, won\u2019t you, mother?
p12893
aVThere\u2019s a chorus\u000awith most of them,\u201d said Dolff, pausing half-way to the door.
p12894
aV\u201cPerhaps\u000aJu and you could tune up in the chorus?
p12895
aVit\u2019s not difficult, and it adds\u000ato the effect.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think, perhaps, I might tune up in the chorus, if it\u2019s not very\u000adifficult.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, that\u2019s famous,\u201d cried Dolff, rushing out of the room.
p12896
aVJanet turned an ingenuous glance to her patronesses.
p12897
aV\u201cAm I doing what you wish?\u201d she said.
p12898
aV\u201cPerhaps you will tell me, dear\u000aMrs. Harwood, what it is best to do.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt will be horrible Christy Minstrels and things,\u201d said Gussy; \u201cif any\u000aone should come, it would be rather dreadful to have the piano taken up\u000ain that way.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAt the same time,\u201d cried Mrs. Harwood, \u201cit would be strange if my Dolff\u000acould not sing what he pleased in his own mother\u2019s house.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, if you take it in that way,\u201d said Gussy.
p12899
aVShe gave a furtive glance at the clock.
p12900
aVIt was getting late; the\u000aprobabilities were that no one would come to-night.
p12901
aVAnd yet sometimes he\u000acame quite late, sometimes he was detained by--business.
p12902
aVIt was strange\u000athat he never should have appeared since that evening of triumph, when\u000athey had shared the plaudits of their friends, and had been drawn so\u000aclose to each other, associated so completely in the common regard.
p12903
aVGussy had felt that something more definite must come into her relations\u000awith Charles Meredith after that, and she was restless and _distraite_,\u000aunhappy yet subduing her unhappiness, above all things anxious not to\u000abetray herself, or to let even her mother suspect what was in her mind.
p12904
aVA woman must never betray what she expects, in so far at least as this\u000agoes.
p12905
aVShe went into the other end of the room, voluntarily withdrawing\u000ato a distance where she could not hear any step outside, with a\u000afantastic hope that when she was thus out of the way it might come: and\u000amoved about, displacing some small pieces of furniture, rustling among\u000athe music on the piano, which was chiefly _his_ music with his name upon\u000ait, in order to give him a chance of arriving unheard.
p12906
aVPoor little\u000adevice of the strained nerves and sick heart!
p12907
aVNo one suspected what was\u000ain Gussy\u2019s mind except the last person whom she could have desired to\u000aknow it--Janet, who followed her movements with a half-contempt,\u000ahalf-sympathy.
p12908
aVJanet herself was fancy free; though she was immensely\u000ainterested in Charles Meredith and his present movements, it was solely\u000awith the interest which is felt in a story, to see what would happen\u000anext; and she had all a girl\u2019s indignation against the woman who thus\u000alet herself go and depended upon a man\u2019s decision for her happiness.
p12909
aVAt\u000aJanet\u2019s age a girl resents and scorns such a renunciation of the\u000awoman\u2019s rights: yet follows the sufferer with an inalienable pity and\u000awonder, too.
p12910
aVDolff came back excited with a sheaf of songs.
p12911
aV\u201cNow, Miss Summerhayes, if you will be so good,\u201d he said.
p12912
aVHe threw off\u000athe pile of music that was on the piano.
p12913
aV\u201cOh, that\u2019s all classic stuff,\u201d\u000ahe said, \u201cI can see with half an eye--and as dull as ditch-water--\u201cC.
p12914
aVMeredith\u201d--it seems all to belong to C. Meredith.
p12915
aVI hope you\u2019ll find\u000amine a little more lively, Miss Summerhayes.
p12916
aVIt\u2019s Meredith and Gussy\u000athat carry on all that, ain\u2019t it?\u201d he said, with a wink and whisper.
p12917
aV\u201cOh, you needn\u2019t be afraid--I know.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet sat down at the piano without making any reply, and Julia stood by\u000aas audience.
p12918
aVDolff placed himself at one side, facing towards the\u000afurther room in which his mother was sitting.
p12919
aVHe had turned her chair\u000around a little, that she might see the performance, which, indeed, was\u000asupposed to gain in effect from the looks and gestures of the performer.
p12920
aVAnd then there ensued the most curious exhibition of native fatuity,\u000avanity, and simplicity that could be imagined.
p12921
aVJanet (perhaps even more\u000aimportant than any other spectator) had the privilege of seeing his\u000aface, too, and all the grimaces he made, as he stood facing an imaginary\u000aaudience.
p12922
aVThe ladies listened to him in a silence which was almost\u000aawful.
p12923
aVJanet, whose hands were busy now, was in no way responsible for Dolff:\u000aand the one who could see everything that was ridiculous in the\u000aexhibition without being humiliated by it was the one who was best off.
p12924
aVBut for Mrs. Harwood, listening with a gasp to her son\u2019s performance,\u000aseeing his contortions of face, his gestures, his complacency, the\u000amoment was terrible.
p12925
aVAnd even Julia, though she was not much more than a\u000achild, and disposed to receive all her brother did as admirable, gazed\u000aat him open-mouthed with horror in her face.
p12926
aVGussy had given him but one\u000alook, and then had strayed out into the hall.
p12927
aVShe was not capable of\u000ajudging.
p12928
aVHer mind was too much distracted with other thoughts.
p12929
aVShe went\u000ainto the hall with a pretence of something to do there, and even into\u000athe dining-room on the other side, where all was dark, yet where she\u000apenetrated, to carry back a vase with flowers, groping her way.
p12930
aVIt was\u000aso near the garden, the hall door, the outer road.
p12931
aVNobody could pass or\u000acome to the gate without being audible.
p12932
aVPoor Gussy pretended even to\u000aherself that her sole object was to take back the flowers which had been\u000amoved into the drawing-room by mistake, though they belonged to the\u000adecoration of the dinner-table.
p12933
aVShe knocked against the displaced chairs\u000aand the corner of the table as she went in in the dark, thus preventing\u000aherself from hearing any sound outside; and when those noises were still\u000aher heart beat so loudly as to drown all sound--of the less importance,\u000aas there was no sound to hear!
p12934
aV\u201cDolff,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, \u201cthat is surely a new style for you.
p12935
aVI don\u2019t\u000aremember ever hearing you sing songs like these before.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have been having some lessons,\u201d said Dolff; \u201cthey are all the rage\u000ajust now.
p12936
aVYou never learn anything else in Oxford.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood; but she said no more, and Dolff, who did not\u000acare very much for her opinion, turned to Janet.
p12937
aV\u201cYou don\u2019t do yourself justice, Miss Summerhayes,\u201d he said.
p12938
aV\u201cYou played\u000athat first-rate.
p12939
aVYou must have heard Arthur Roberts, or some of them, to\u000ado it as well as that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo,\u201d said Janet, \u201cI never heard of Arthur Roberts.
p12940
aVWho is he?\u201d a\u000aquestion which made Dolff laugh--\u201cscream with laughing,\u201d--he said to\u000ahimself.
p12941
aV\u201cOh, you _are_ original!
p12942
aVWho is Arthur Roberts?--that is a good one!
p12943
aVWho\u000ais Shakespeare?
p12944
aVYou might just as well ask one question as the other.
p12945
aVBut you play as if--as if you had been all your life at the Vic.
p12946
aVI never\u000aheard any one play so well before.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER XVIII.
p12947
aVIt was not till some evenings after this that Mr. Charles Meredith made\u000ahis appearance again.
p12948
aVTo tell the truth, he had been a little alarmed by his position in\u000arespect to Miss Harwood.
p12949
aVThe applause they had received at the concert,\u000awhich somehow enveloped both of them in a sort of unity--a oneness which\u000awas embarrassing, and provoked inquiries and looks of intelligence,\u000aglances and hints of all sorts--had given him a little shock.
p12950
aVIt had not\u000aaffected Gussy in the same way, for Gussy was far more deeply and truly\u000atouched than her partner in that success.
p12951
aVShe had given up her whole\u000abeing to him with the unreasonable confidence which is sometimes to be\u000aseen in an otherwise unimaginative and unemotional woman, never doubting\u000afrom the first the object of his attentions, feeling that he could have\u000abut one reason for his frequent visits, and that the gradual manner in\u000awhich she herself had been separated and swept up, as it were, into his\u000aidentity, was the natural result of a strong and certain desire on his\u000apart to attract and appropriate her--an unquestionable feeling to which\u000aher gradually elicited responses were natural and fitting.
p12952
aVIt never\u000aoccurred to Gussy, who was a little narrow, as was natural to her\u000aeducation and circumstances, but very sensible and just, that Meredith\u2019s\u000asentiments, which had been so distinctly shown, could be anything but\u000adefinite and certain.
p12953
aVTo her there appeared nothing accidental, nothing\u000afortuitous, in the way in which it had all come about.
p12954
aVGradually he had\u000asecured the _entre_ and the complete freedom of intercourse which is\u000anot very common in English houses.
p12955
aVThere had been a break during his\u000aabsence in the country, but this break had been followed by a return to\u000aall the old habits, by the resumption of all his claims upon her\u000aattention and sympathy, those claims to which she had already responded\u000ain all sincerity and good faith.
p12956
aVGussy had no sensation of having gone a\u000astep further than she had been led and persuaded to go.
p12957
aVShe had no doubt\u000awhatever that of this intercourse, which he had so sought, so organized,\u000aso firmly established, every step was intended.
p12958
aVHe had set himself, she\u000abelieved, to win her love, to gain her heart.
p12959
aVWhat other reason could\u000athere be?
p12960
aVIt was all his doing.
p12961
aVHe it was who had pressed for each new\u000aextension of privilege: for what?--for no conceivable reason save one,\u000athat he loved her, and desired to make her love him.
p12962
aVSuch was Gussy\u2019s theory.
p12963
aVShe had been first flattered, then touched by\u000athese assiduities, and finally, there being no reason whatever against\u000ait, she had yielded to the gradually growing response in her own bosom.
p12964
aVShe was not unaware that this might attain to greater potency than the\u000ademand which had evoked it, for he was a man, about in the world, and\u000ahaving a great many things to distract him, whereas she was a woman with\u000anothing particular in her mind save this new interest which filled her\u000athoughts night and day.
p12965
aVThere was no doubt that it might grow more\u000aengrossing than his love.
p12966
aVShe was aware of the danger, and quite\u000areasonable about it; but his had been the first--his had been the\u000afoundation of all.
p12967
aVShe was not ashamed of loving him, nor even of the\u000aimpatience that now devoured her to have him speak and put the whole on\u000athe footing of a known and established certainty.
p12968
aVIt wanted that, at the\u000apoint to which the matter had now reached.
p12969
aVAs soon as they had once\u000aunderstood each other, all would be well.
p12970
aVUnderstood each other!
p12971
aVYes,\u000athey did so already; but it was necessary that it should be\u000aclear--spoken out--settled.
p12972
aVGussy could not tell what it was that\u000arestrained her lover.
p12973
aVBut she was restless and a little impatient,\u000aknowing that, by this time, the certainty ought to be fully\u000acomprehended of all, and the result known.
p12974
aVIt had not been anything in the nature of jealousy which had made her\u000aunwilling to take advantage of Janet\u2019s services, but only an\u000aindisposition to let any third party come in--to have another associated\u000ain the already long-lingering duet which she had every reason to believe\u000awas to continue all her life.
p12975
aVHe had chosen that way of drawing her to\u000ahim which, in the circumstances of the family, was the most effectual\u000away, the easiest--perhaps the only manner in which he could have secured\u000athe attention which was due to her mother and sister first, and which it\u000awould otherwise have been so difficult to obtain.
p12976
aVAnd it had become a\u000amethod dear to her--and she did not like to have any one come in, to\u000adisturb the isolation in which their music wrapped them.
p12977
aVThis was\u000aall--no fear of a new face or attraction for him--no feeling of rivalry.
p12978
aVJanet was perhaps incapable of comprehending how very far the young\u000awoman, so much less clever, less instructed in the usual course of\u000aaffairs, perhaps less intelligent than herself, was from thinking of any\u000asuch danger.
p12979
aVBut all this was quite apart from Mr. Charles Meredith and his\u000asentiments, which had not at any time been those believed in by Gussy.
p12980
aVHe had found it amusing and piquant to make his way into that secluded,\u000abut most respectably secluded, house in St. John\u2019s Wood.
p12981
aVA little\u000acuriosity of his own, the secret of a something to be found out even in\u000athe heart of that respectability, had for a moment mingled with his\u000aother motives; but that had found little encouragement in anything he\u000asaw or heard, and had gradually died out, leaving behind a pleasurable\u000aprivilege--an amusing variety to his other engagements, an ever-ready\u000away of spending an evening in which he had nothing else to do.
p12982
aVHe had\u000aknown the Harwoods almost all his life, and this familiarity, to begin\u000awith, had made the domestic circle the more easily comprehensible to\u000ahim: the unmanageable child, Ju, who lost no opportunity of showing how\u000aundesirable she thought his presence; the mother, mysteriously incapable\u000aof leaving her chair, though her children frankly declared their\u000adisbelief in her inability; the room so bright and full of comfort with\u000athat shadowy background which seemed made for a romance, tickled the\u000afancy of the young man.
p12983
aVHe had an inclination towards Gussy\u000aHarwood--liked her--felt that, if he were ever to come the length of\u000amarrying, she would be a very suitable wife for him, and her respectable\u000afortune a very comfortable foundation on which to begin life.
p12984
aVAnd then\u000ahe was very fond of music--music, that is, represented by new songs and\u000aduets in which his own fine tenor might be enhanced by a gentle soprano\u000aacknowledged to be very sweet, yet in no way capable of eclipsing the\u000aricher tones it accompanied.
p12985
aVAll these mingled sentiments had led him to the course of conduct which\u000ahe had pursued for some time before Janet\u2019s appearance, but into which\u000aher sudden appearance had imported a little difference.
p12986
aVIt will be seen\u000athat these vague and mingled sentiments were entirely unlike that for\u000awhich he had credit in the mind of Augusta Harwood--the steady and\u000aserious love by which she supposed him to be moved.
p12987
aVThe foregone\u000aconclusion of a happy marriage, a household equally respectable, and\u000astill more bright than that in which the preliminaries took place had no\u000aexistence.
p12988
aVIt was always on the cards, of course, that Gussy Harwood and\u000ahe might marry and settle down together.
p12989
aVIt would not be a very romantic\u000aconclusion, still Meredith was aware that he himself was not at all a\u000aromantic personage, and it would not in any way be a bad arrangement.
p12990
aVBut where was the need of going so far as that?
p12991
aVHe liked to know where\u000ahe could spend an evening pleasantly when he pleased; he liked to hear\u000athe sound of his own voice, and even to feel that the voice of the other\u000aperformer was not likely to beguile the applauses of their audience away\u000afrom himself--when they had an audience; he liked to have those\u000aexcellent dinners from time to time, with the other man who could not\u000ahelp perceiving how entirely the entertainment was for Meredith\u2019s\u000agratification.
p12992
aVAll these things were very pleasant, and Mrs. Harwood was\u000aquite able, no doubt, to take care of her own daughter and all the\u000a_convenances_, and it was none of his business to watch over Gussy in\u000acase his continual visits should be misunderstood.
p12993
aVBut the concert had certainly made a little crisis in this easy\u000aintercourse--the concert and Janet\u2019s appearance on the scene, and the\u000alittle excitement she had produced, and the additional signs of regard\u000ait had been necessary to lavish upon Gussy, to make her feel herself\u000aalways the first person, notwithstanding any interest that another might\u000acall forth.
p12994
aVHe had felt that a great step had been taken in that\u000aconcert.
p12995
aVTo be sure it could not, strictly speaking, be asserted to mean\u000aanything at all.
p12996
aVA duet between a soprano and a tenor--what more\u000ainnocent?
p12997
aVTheir voices suited; what had their persons or their lives to\u000ado with it?
p12998
aVCharles Meredith knew, however, that though this might be\u000atrue enough in the case of most tenors and sopranos, it would not be\u000atrue as between Gussy Harwood and himself.
p12999
aVThe audience was not an\u000aaudience drawn from the larger public, which might have known nothing\u000afurther, but a St. John\u2019s Wood audience, which knew everything about\u000ahim, and that he visited the Harwoods \u201cevery day of his life.\u201d This was\u000anot exactly true, but it was how he heard it stated in the dark, outside\u000athe concert-room, by one of the departing hearers.
p13000
aVAll those present\u000aknew them, and knew all about them, and naturally made their remarks:\u000a\u201cOf course it will be a match; he is there every day of his life.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat a vulgar definiteness there is in these criticisms!
p13001
aVPeople who\u000apretend to be one\u2019s friends, yet speak of one without a gleam of\u000aunderstanding, as if all one\u2019s intentions were cut and dry.
p13002
aVMeredith\u000afelt angry, but he dared not show it, for it was clearly his duty to\u000aescort Gussy home, and to tell Mrs. Harwood what a success it had been.
p13003
aVBut after that he was seized with a panic, and did not come back.
p13004
aVHe saw\u000athat a crisis had come, as well as any one--a crisis which seemed to him\u000avery premature, and for which he was unprepared.
p13005
aVI think there is some allowance to be made for young men who in these\u000adays hesitate about taking the last step which makes marriage\u000ainevitable.
p13006
aVWe are not now discussing the so-called \u201csmart\u201d people, who\u000alive after their kind, and afford no rule for the rest of the world, but\u000ayoung men of occupations, who have, as people say, their own way to\u000amake.
p13007
aVA small income very often represents a great deal more than it is\u000ato an unmarried man, with all the luxury of the clubs behind him: and it\u000arepresents a great deal less than it is to the man who is going to\u000amarry--witness all the foolish statistics periodically placed before the\u000aworld.
p13008
aVIt is rather surprising how, when the moment and the impulse\u000acomes, all these precautions are so easily thrown to the winds: but\u000athere is nobody in modern society so well off as the young man with a\u000asmall competency, a good club, and a tolerable acquaintance.
p13009
aVIt is\u000aheroic of him to risk all his comforts and immunities, the things he can\u000ado, and the things nobody expects him to do, for the sake of a young\u000awoman who on her side is much better off at home, if she would only\u000athink so.
p13010
aVBut, fortunately for the race if not for the individual,\u000anature scorns all such judicious reflections, and follows its own\u000aimpulse at whatsoever expense.
p13011
aVMeredith, however, who was not in love, but only amiably, pleasurably\u000ainclined towards Gussy Harwood, felt their full force when he was thus\u000apulled up and brought face to face with inevitable consequences.
p13012
aVIn his\u000apresent circumstances he was very well off indeed: he had all that a\u000ayoung man could desire.
p13013
aVHe knew a number of people, and was civil to\u000athem, and derived from this a little benefit of dinner-parties, dances,\u000aand invitations from Saturday till Monday, for which he was not expected\u000ato do anything except to continue to be civil in return.
p13014
aVAnd he could\u000aalso entertain at his club a friend or two when he pleased.
p13015
aVI do not\u000aknow whether the dinners at the more modest clubs are as good as those\u000aof which we read in novels, at which the very fine gentlemen dispense\u000aand enjoy hospitality; but they are almost sure to be better than those\u000awhich a Mrs. Charles Meredith, in a little villa in the suburbs, or in a\u000alittle flat high up in the district styled W., could produce with great\u000atrouble, a complete _bouleversement_ of the small household, and a\u000agreengrocer from round the corner to wait.
p13016
aVThe servants at the club are\u000areal servants, the dinners quite genuine, and giving no extra trouble.
p13017
aVIf Charles Meredith had been in love, it would have been unpardonable in\u000ahim to have made any such reflection.
p13018
aVBut then he was not in love.
p13019
aVAnd\u000ahe was startled, and paused in the face of fate.
p13020
aVHe might not perhaps have done so with quite so much perturbation if\u000athere had not been at the same time a little point of interest in his\u000amind about the other little girl who had appeared so inopportunely in\u000aSt. John\u2019s Wood.
p13021
aVHe was not in the least in love with Janet.
p13022
aVBut she was\u000aamusing--a great deal more amusing than Gussy, with all whose opinions\u000aand inclinations he was acquainted, and who changed little from any\u000astanding-point she had once taken.
p13023
aVIt amused him to get possession of\u000athe governess, to make her play, to watch her looks, and communicate\u000awith her telegraphically, nobody being aware of that intercourse.
p13024
aVThat\u000aJanet did not respond, or, at least, did not willingly respond, made it\u000aall the more piquant, for even a glance of indignation now and then, a\u000aflash of anger, was a reply, and he could read in the involuntary\u000amovement of her little shoulders, as she played, a hundred little\u000acriticisms and signs of what she was thinking; the thrill of displeasure\u000aat a false note made him laugh, and the clang of accompaniment with\u000awhich she would suddenly drown a failure--all this imported a new\u000aelement into the evening with which he was delighted.
p13025
aVBut all these\u000aamusements would have to be put a stop to if he married and settled down\u000ato domestic felicity and the enjoyment of a sensible companion and a\u000acomfortable life at home.
p13026
aVAll of which things made Charles Meredith pause; but after a week or so\u000ahe began to feel that his hesitation, if too prolonged, would in its way\u000aproduce a decision which he desired as little as the other.
p13027
aVAnd then he\u000aremembered that Dolff was at home, which would always make a diversion\u000aand stave off explanations.
p13028
aVThese deliberations have seemed to occupy a\u000along period; yet it was not, after all, a very long period.
p13029
aVAbout ten\u000adays after the concert, the door being open to admit of the exit of\u000aDolff, who, in all the glories of evening costume, was stepping forth\u000atowards a waiting hansom, ready to convey him to some evening festivity,\u000aCharles Meredith slipped in unheard, with his usual little roll of\u000amusic, but less than his usual confidence and calm.
p13030
aVHe was met in the\u000ahall by Julia, who had come out to superintend her brother\u2019s departure,\u000aand whose pleasure in Dolff\u2019s entertainment and finery was brought to a\u000asudden pause by the apparition of a figure less beloved.
p13031
aVShe gave vent,\u000ahaving no watch upon her, to that sound which had died from her lips, or\u000arather from her teeth, for so long, but with which she had been wont to\u000awelcome Meredith.
p13032
aV\u201cOh!\u201d or rather \u201cS--s!\u201d said Julia, \u201cso this is you--again----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, my dear child, it is I--again,\u201d he replied, with a mocking bow and\u000asmile.
p13033
aVCHAPTER XIX.
p13034
aVMeredith paused at the door inspecting the quiet interior thus thrown\u000aopen to him--in which he was not looked for, and where, accordingly, his\u000aarrival remained unobserved--the doors being all open still for the exit\u000aof Dolff.
p13035
aVIt startled him a little to find in how like its ordinary\u000acondition everything was, and how little sign of the absence of a\u000ahabitual visitor was about the place.
p13036
aVThere were a hundred signs of\u000aDolff, but even the place near Gussy usually though tacitly reserved for\u000ahimself was filled up, and Gussy sat at the eternal woman\u2019s work which,\u000ain some circumstances, is so exasperating to a man, as composed as if he\u000ahad never crossed her horizon.
p13037
aVThey were all at it, Mrs. Harwood with\u000aher crewels, Janet with something else.
p13038
aVHe wondered, half-angrily, if\u000athey would go on forever with their heads bowed over that infernal\u000asewing whatever might happen, even that quick little thing, that\u000acreature born under more variable skies, the governess.
p13039
aVShe, however,\u000awas the first to find him out.
p13040
aVA consciousness of some new element in\u000athe warm atmosphere, something that had not been there a minute before,\u000amoved Janet.
p13041
aVShe looked up and uttered a faint exclamation.
p13042
aVAh!
p13043
aVhe had thought there was no difference, but there had been a\u000adifference.
p13044
aVGussy had been sitting like a statue, quite still, but not\u000athe faintest thrill of movement in her.
p13045
aVShe did not expect him, or\u000aanyone, she was not thinking of him, or anyone, quite self-contained,\u000aself-absorbed.
p13046
aVHe was almost ashamed to think how he had been thinking\u000aof her, complacently realizing her suspense, and disappointment, and\u000awonder at his non-appearance.
p13047
aVThe extreme composure of her aspect gave\u000aMeredith a shock which would have done much to redress the balance\u000abetween them.
p13048
aVShe did not even raise her head at Janet\u2019s exclamation.
p13049
aVIt\u000awas Mrs. Harwood who did that, crying out, \u201cGod bless me!
p13050
aVCharley!\u201d with\u000aa pleasure of which there could be no doubt.
p13051
aVAnd a sort of shock passed\u000aover Gussy, electric, spasmodic, he could not tell what it was,\u000asomething that moved her from the crown of light hair on her head to the\u000atip of the shoe which was visible under her gown.
p13052
aVIt all passed in a\u000aminute, nay, in a second, as so many a crisis does.
p13053
aVHe could see it go\u000aover her; had not his eyes been opened by a sense of guilt, and by\u000avarious other convictions, he might have known nothing of it; but he\u000adid, and suddenly became aware that he had something more to deal with\u000athan a girl\u2019s momentary annoyance at the absence of the man whom she was\u000abeginning to care for.
p13054
aVAt the end of that moment, when he had come\u000aforward to shake hands with Mrs. Harwood, Gussy rose, and gave him her\u000ahand with perfect composure.
p13055
aVOn her side she was quite sure that she had\u000abetrayed nothing, not even the mere surprise which would have been so\u000anatural.
p13056
aV\u201cYou have been a great stranger, Charley,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood.
p13057
aV\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d he said, \u201cno one can know that so well as I. I have been\u000adriven to the end of my patience.
p13058
aVI kept hoping that one of you would\u000atake a little interest, and ask what I was about.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe kept his eyes on Gussy, but Gussy never moved or gave sign of\u000aconsciousness.
p13059
aV\u201cMy dear boy,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, \u201cwomen never like to interfere--to ask\u000awhat a young man is about.
p13060
aVYou are so much more your own masters than we\u000aare.
p13061
aVWe know very well that if you want to come you will come, and if\u000ayou don\u2019t----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow unjust you are with your general principles!
p13062
aVHere is one poor\u000amiserable exception, then, to the rule--who has tried to come, and\u000athought he could manage it evening after evening.
p13063
aVWell, it is all in the\u000away of business.
p13064
aVYou have always been afraid I was idle.
p13065
aVWhat will you\u000asay when I tell you that I have been in chambers--sometimes till eight\u000aand nine o\u2019clock every night?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI shall hope it means a lot of new clients, Charley,\u201d the old lady\u000asaid.
p13066
aV\u201cWell, I think it does.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe did not wink at Janet--oh, no!
p13067
aVthat would have been vulgarity\u000aitself--the sort of communication which takes place between the footman\u000ain a play and the chamber-maid who is in his confidence.
p13068
aVMr. Charles\u000aMeredith\u2019s manners were irreproachable, and vulgarity in that kind of\u000away impossible to him.
p13069
aVBut he did catch Janet\u2019s attention with a corner\u000aof his eye, as it were, which expressed something a little different\u000afrom the open look which was bent on Mrs. Harwood--or, rather, on Gussy,\u000aat whom he glanced as he spoke.
p13070
aVAnd then he entered into certain\u000adetails.
p13071
aVMrs. Harwood, though she was disabled and incapable of getting\u000aout of her chair, was an excellent woman of business, and she entered\u000ainto the particulars of his narrative with great interest.
p13072
aVShe said at\u000athe end, with a satisfied nod of her head,\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, Charley, I hope we may now feel that you are beginning to catch\u000athe rising tide.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope so, too,\u201d said the young man.
p13073
aVAnd then it seemed to dawn upon\u000ahim that these agreeable auguries might lead him too far.
p13074
aV\u201cA little time\u000awill tell,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a real beginning or only a flash in\u000athe pan.
p13075
aVI am afraid to calculate upon anything too soon.
p13076
aVIn three\u000amonths or so, if all goes on well----\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet asked herself, with a keenness of inquiry which took her by\u000asurprise, what, oh, what did he mean by three months?
p13077
aVWas that said for\u000aGussy?
p13078
aVWas it said for anyone else?
p13079
aVDid he, by any possibility, think\u000athat _she_ cared--that it pleased her to know that he was deceiving Mrs.\u000aHarwood and her daughter?
p13080
aVShe felt very angry at the whole matter, which\u000ashe thought she saw through so completely, but which, after all, she did\u000anot in the least see through.
p13081
aVJanet thought that for some reason or\u000aother this young man was \u201camusing himself,\u201d according to the ordinary\u000ajargon, with Miss Harwood\u2019s too-little concealed devotion, that he\u000asecretly made fun of the woman who loved him, and was preparing, when\u000athe time came, a disenchantment for her and revelation of his own\u000asentiments, which would probably break Gussy\u2019s heart.
p13082
aVIt can scarcely be\u000asaid that Janet felt those sentiments of moral indignation which such a\u000adeliberate treachery ought to have called forth.
p13083
aVShe was still so far in\u000athe kitten stage that it half amused her to see Mr. Meredith \u201ctaking in\u201d\u000aMiss Harwood.
p13084
aVIt amused her to think that probably he had been having\u000asome wild party of his young men friends (a party of young men always\u000aseems wild, riotous, full of inconceivable frolic and enjoyment to a\u000agirl\u2019s fancy) in his chambers, on some of those evenings which he so\u000ademurely represented to the old lady as full of business.
p13085
aVShe could not\u000ahelp an inclination to laugh at that.
p13086
aVIt is the kind of deceit which has\u000aalways been laughed at from the beginning of time.
p13087
aVBut she felt angry\u000aabout the three months.
p13088
aVWhat did he mean by three months?
p13089
aVWas it for\u000aGussy to lull her suspicions?
p13090
aVWas it for--anyone else?
p13091
aVJanet felt as if\u000ashe were being made a party to some unkind scheme which had not merely\u000afun for its purpose.
p13092
aVWhy should he look at her in that comic way when he\u000asaid anything particularly grave?
p13093
aVJanet turned round her little shoulder\u000ato Mr. Meredith, and became more and more engrossed in her needlework.
p13094
aVBut yet it was strange that whatever she did he succeeded in catching\u000aher eye.
p13095
aV\u201cSome one has been singing,\u201d he said, presently, with a little start of\u000asurprise.
p13096
aV\u201cI brought something with me I thought Gussy would like--but\u000ayou have been singing without me?\u201d\u000a\u000aHe turned round upon her suddenly at this point.
p13097
aVGussy had been very\u000aquiet; she had said scarcely anything.
p13098
aVShe had allowed him to go through\u000aall those explanations with her mother.
p13099
aVAt first she had closed her\u000aheart, as she thought, against them; but it is not so easy to close a\u000aheart when it is suddenly melted by a touch of thaw after a frost.
p13100
aVGussy\u000ahad been frozen up hard as December--or even February--could do it.
p13101
aVBut\u000awhat is frost when there comes that indescribable, that subtle,\u000ainvisible breath which in a moment undoes what it has taken nights and\u000adays of black frost to do?
p13102
aVWhat a good thing it is to think that the\u000afrost which works underhand and throws its ribs across the streams, and\u000aits icicles from the roofs by degrees, takes days to make ice that will\u000a\u201cbear,\u201d and that the sweeter influence can bring all that bondage to\u000aruin in an hour or two!
p13103
aVGussy\u2019s heart had frozen up, putting on an\u000aadditional layer of ice every day; but in a moment it was all gone,\u000asliding away in blocks, in shapeless masses, upon the irresistible\u000aflood.
p13104
aVThe flood, of course, is all the stronger from that mass of\u000amelted stuff that sweeps into it, giving an impetus to every swollen\u000acurrent.
p13105
aVGussy made an effort to feel as if this melting and softening\u000ahad not been, as if she were as she had been an hour before; but what\u000aattempt could be more ineffectual?
p13106
aVFrost may counterfeit a thaw on the\u000asurface when the sun shines; but what thaw can counterfeit frost.
p13107
aVIt was\u000anot among the things that are possible.
p13108
aV\u201cI have not been singing,\u201d she said, softly, her eyes wandering, in\u000aspite of her, to the little roll in his hand.
p13109
aV\u201cYou forget we have had\u000asomething else to amuse us all these evenings.
p13110
aVIt is Dolff who has been\u000asinging.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd a very nice voice he has got, now that it has been trained a\u000alittle, poor boy,\u201d said his mother, \u201cthough I am not very sure that I\u000alike his taste in songs.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd Miss Summerhayes plays for him,\u201d said Meredith, turning round upon\u000aJanet with a laugh.
p13111
aVHe faced her this time, looking at her frankly, not\u000atrying to catch any corner of her eye.
p13112
aVHis look had a gleam of merriment\u000aand saucy satisfaction which make Janet glow with anger.
p13113
aV\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell\u000ayou so?\u201d he seemed to say with his raised eyebrows.
p13114
aVHe laughed out with\u000aa genial roar of amusement.
p13115
aV\u201cI knew Miss Summerhayes would play for\u000ahim,\u201d he cried.
p13116
aVHow did he know anything of the kind?
p13117
aVHow dared he laugh in that meaning\u000away?
p13118
aVHow dared he look at Janet as if he had found her out; as if she,\u000atoo, had a scheme like himself?
p13119
aVJanet gave him a look in return which\u000amight have turned a more sensitive man to stone, and she said, with\u000agreat dignity, wrapping herself up in the humility of her\u000agoverness-state as in a mantle:\u000a\u000a\u201cI am here to play for anyone who wishes for my services, Mr. Meredith,\u000aas I think you ought to know.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGood heavens,\u201d cried Mrs. Harwood, \u201cmy dear child!
p13120
aVI hope you don\u2019t\u000atake it in that serious way.
p13121
aVIf it is so disagreeable to you, my dear,\u000ayou shall never be asked to humor poor Dolff again.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, Mrs. Harwood, that is not what I meant!
p13122
aVI am very glad to do it for\u000aanyone, but I don\u2019t like to hear people talk--to hear people laugh----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe little thing is in a temper,\u201d said Meredith, aside to Gussy, \u201chave\u000aI said anything so very dreadful?
p13123
aVCome and try whether they have thumped\u000athe piano all to pieces, and then we can talk.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t know that you have said anything dreadful.
p13124
aVAnd we can talk very\u000awell here,\u201d said Gussy, in the same undertone.
p13125
aV\u201cShe is like a little turkey-cock,\u201d said Meredith.
p13126
aV\u201cWhat has been going\u000aon?
p13127
aVTo think that something should always turn up, a farce or a tragedy,\u000awhen one is out of the way for a few days.\u201d\u000a\u000aGussy asked herself, with a catching of the breath, if it were a farce\u000aor a tragedy?
p13128
aVHow true that was!
p13129
aVNo, it would not be a tragedy now--now\u000athat he had come back.
p13130
aV\u201cNothing has been going on--except some silly songs,\u201d she said.
p13131
aVIt did not occur to her that her own songs were silly, or that there\u000amight be two meanings to the word, but Meredith was more ready in his\u000acomprehension.
p13132
aV\u201cAh, some silly songs!\u201d he said.
p13133
aVUpon which Gussy, feeling more and more the soft welling-up from under\u000athe crackling frost, of the warmer waters, felt a compunction.
p13134
aV\u201cPoor Dolff,\u201d she said, \u201cis not altogether exalted in his tastes, you\u000aknow.
p13135
aVAnd he has taken a music-hall craze.
p13136
aVI suppose it is from the\u000amusic-hall they come, all those wonderful performances.
p13137
aVBut he likes\u000athem, it appears, as well--as well----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs we like ours,\u201d said Meredith.
p13138
aV\u201cWell, ours----\u201d she colored a little as she said the word; but why\u000ashould she not say it, seeing he had thus given her the cue?
p13139
aV\u201cOurs are\u000abetter worth liking.
p13140
aVAt the same time,\u201d said Gussy, returning to her old\u000aself, \u201cwe are all so silly in this family that we can\u2019t do anything\u000awithout doing a great deal too much of it.
p13141
aVWe can\u2019t, I fear, take\u000aanything moderately.
p13142
aVWe do it with all our heart.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is why you do it so well,\u201d said Meredith.
p13143
aVHis voice had a slight quaver in it, which might have been taken in more\u000asenses than one.
p13144
aVIt might have meant emotion, and again it might have\u000ameant a suppressed laugh, for to imagine that Dolff sang his music-hall\u000asongs exceptionally well because he sang them with all his heart was a\u000alittle trying to the gravity.
p13145
aVBut now that he had set up a conversation\u000a_sotto voce_, and now that Gussy had been brought back to talking of\u000awhat was habitually done \u201cin the family,\u201d Mr. Meredith felt that he had\u000agot back upon the old ground.
p13146
aVAs for Janet, she packed up her sewing things in her little basket, and\u000abegged Mrs. Harwood\u2019s permission to retire.
p13147
aV\u201cI have a little headache,\u201d she said.
p13148
aVGood Mrs. Harwood was much concerned and very sorry, but agreed that\u000aquiet and going to bed early was the best thing for a headache.
p13149
aVAnd when\u000athe lovers--were they the lovers?--went to the other room, Janet rose\u000aand stole away.
p13150
aVShe was not gone so soon but that she heard Meredith\u000aburst into a laugh over Dolff\u2019s songs, which were all scattered about.
p13151
aVHe sang a snatch of one of them mockingly as she was going out, and\u000acaught her with a wave of his hand, an elevation of his eyebrows, and a\u000aslight nod of his head.
p13152
aVHe would not let her escape, he who had so\u000aeasily made up his own difficulties, but must discharge that arrow at\u000aher, hold that whip of mockery over her.
p13153
aVJanet closed the door upon\u000aherself with a studied quiet, which was even more demonstrative of her\u000astate of mind than had she shut it with a violent slam, as Julia would\u000ahave done; but it was more hard to suppress the pants of her laboring,\u000aangry breath.
p13154
aVCHAPTER XX.
p13155
aVJanet sent out before her into the hall a bursting sigh, a hot wave of\u000aimpatient fiery breath, which seemed to raise a little mist before her\u000aeyes as she emerged into the silence and found herself alone, leaving\u000amockery and music, and sentiment true or false, behind.
p13156
aVWhat did he\u000amean, what did he want, that visitor whose non-appearance had held the\u000ahousehold in suspense, whose coming had introduced so many elements of\u000adisturbance?
p13157
aVIt cannot be said that Janet herself had been uninfluenced\u000aby his absence.
p13158
aVIt had been a fact of which she could not get rid,\u000aalways present with her as with Gussy, though in a different way.
p13159
aVCertainly he had taken away much of the salt of life with him--the\u000ainterest, the drama.
p13160
aVAnd now that he had come back the salt had not lost\u000aits savor; it was almost too keen: it affected sharply not only the\u000achief personage in the piece, but the audience.
p13161
aVHe was now more than\u000aactor--he was audience also; and that look of intelligence which had\u000aconveyed so many confidences on his own part now expressed the most\u000adaring suggestions as to hers.
p13162
aVJanet burst out of the room with a sense\u000athat her period of peace was over.
p13163
aVHis looks would put motives to the\u000amost trifling actions.
p13164
aVWhat had he to do with her?
p13165
aVHow dared he to\u000asuggest that this booby, this music-hall hero, this cherished only son,\u000acould in any way affect the life of Janet?
p13166
aV\u201cMiss Summerhayes plays his\u000aaccompaniments.\u201d The tone was light enough, the laugh as light; but it\u000astung Janet to the very depths of her heart.
p13167
aVSomething cold and fresh blowing in her face made her turn to the door,\u000awhich had been left inadvertently open, filling the house with the chill\u000aof December.
p13168
aVOutside it was a beautiful night--the moon shining full,\u000athe stars sparkling with that keen glitter which is given by frost, the\u000ashadows of the leafless trees standing as if engraved upon the\u000awhiteness, not a breath stirring.
p13169
aVMoonlight is always an attraction to a\u000agirl, and the outer air the best calmer of feverish thoughts.
p13170
aVShe caught\u000aa shawl from the stand, and wrapping it round her, went softly out.
p13171
aVEverything was very still.
p13172
aVTalk of the silence of the hills!
p13173
aVThe hills\u000ahave sounds innumerable that can never be silenced--movements of birds,\u000aof insects, of living creatures of all kinds; rustlings among the\u000aheather; tinklings of water; the air itself, occupying vast fields of\u000aspace, has a breath--which means silence, but is not.
p13174
aVBut, if you like,\u000athe silence, in St. John\u2019s Wood!
p13175
aVThat is something worth speaking of.
p13176
aVThere was not a sound.
p13177
aVAt long intervals, when anybody moved in the\u000aworld outside, you could hear the distant footstep walk out of the\u000aunknown, advance step by step as if it had been that of a messenger of\u000adoom, diverge, pass away again, grow fainter and fainter till it went\u000aout in the stillness like the withdrawal of a light.
p13178
aVThat mystic, unseen\u000apassage occurred from time to time, but faintly at a distance.
p13179
aVSometimes\u000athere came into the absolute stillness a distant jar of wheels,\u000aincreasing and diminishing in the same manner, going out in space.
p13180
aVWhen Janet stole out, in her little thin evening shoes that made no\u000asound, the house stood surrounded by that intense quiet and moonlight\u000alike a house in a dream.
p13181
aVLike its own enclosure of humble human garden\u000asoil, that mystic atmosphere isolated and surrounded it from everything\u000aelse in the world.
p13182
aVIt was almost an awe to steal round the white path,\u000aand cross the branching shadows that lay over it in all the complication\u000aof their elaborate anatomy, and watch the dark and solid dwelling\u000astanding in the midst, surrounded by all that reverence of nature, with\u000aa touch of yellow light here and there in its windows, and such foolish\u000aevanescent fret and jar of feelings and thoughts within!
p13183
aVJanet\u2019s own\u000alittle step, which was scarcely so much as the stir of a bird, struck,\u000ashe felt, a half-guilty little broken note into the profound calm.
p13184
aVThe\u000achill of the air cooled her little head.
p13185
aVShe was so small, so\u000ainsignificant an atom in that silent world, troubled about matters so\u000ainfinitesimally little, so unworthy to be breathed in the all-listening\u000aear of night.
p13186
aVShe had made the round of the garden, which was a long piece of ground,\u000amore than half of it grass, and of a very woodland aspect for anything\u000aso near London, and was about passing the side of the house on her way\u000aback, when Janet\u2019s attention was suddenly roused in a very extraordinary\u000away.
p13187
aVThe house was square, of the commonest comfortable form, but on the\u000awestern side there had been built on to it, at some previous period, a\u000awing, which projected in front, making a gable, and slightly outpassing\u000athe _corps du logis_.
p13188
aVThis wing, however, was not, so far as Janet knew,\u000aever used at all.
p13189
aVIf used, it was as a lodging or workshop, whatever his\u000aemployment might be, for the mysterious Vicars, who yet was not\u000amysterious at all--the man-servant of whom more had been seen since\u000aDolff\u2019s return home, and who, Janet had vaguely understood, lived in\u000asome corner of the house, carrying on his own avocations, whatever they\u000awere, but at hand when he was wanted for any special service--a\u000aprivilege given by the kindness of Mrs. Harwood to an old servant, but\u000aalso a convenience to herself.
p13190
aVIt was after Janet had seen this\u000apersonage carrying through an open door, which had all the appearance at\u000aother times of being hermetically closed, a tray covered with dainties,\u000athat Mrs. Harwood herself had explained the position of Vicars to the\u000agoverness, thus settling the question.
p13191
aVNothing could possibly be more uninhabited, more shut-up and empty, than\u000athe wing.
p13192
aVIt had two long windows on the upper floor, facing the garden,\u000awhich were so grown over with ivy that it was clearly apparent no light\u000acould enter, or human uses be served by them.
p13193
aVThe ivy was carefully\u000atrained, and perhaps a little thinner than usual at this time of the\u000ayear.
p13194
aVAs Janet came opposite the windows, something--she could not tell\u000awhat--made her look up.
p13195
aVThe moonlight was streaming full upon them,\u000ashowing white crevices and reflections in the half-covered window-panes\u000awhich never showed by day.
p13196
aVShe stopped short, struck by an alarm and\u000ahorror which seemed to freeze the blood in her veins.
p13197
aVAt the nearest\u000awindow, in an opening made by the curvature of a great ivy branch half\u000adenuded of leaves, there appeared to her the face of an old man with\u000awhite hair and a long, white beard--a white image so like the moonlight\u000athat, after the first dreadful realization of what she saw as a face,\u000aJanet, in her terror, tried to persuade herself that it was only some\u000aeffect of the white light shining upon the panes, which were covered by\u000adust and the droppings of the heavy foliage.
p13198
aVIf she had hurried away\u000athen, flying indoors, as was her first impulse, no doubt she would have\u000abeen able to persuade herself that this was the case.
p13199
aVBut she was, on\u000athe other hand, too much frightened, too much excited, to fly.
p13200
aVShe stood\u000astill, scarcely able to draw her breath.
p13201
aVA pale, very pale face, with a long, white beard--patriarchal, like the\u000abeard of a prophet--white hair, deep-sunken, aged eyes, looking up\u000atowards the moon.
p13202
aVA sort of frenzy of terror caught hold upon Janet, so\u000athat she could not move.
p13203
aVWho was it?
p13204
aVWho was it?
p13205
aVVague recollections\u000aflew across her mind of things she had read--of an old, blind, mad king\u000awhom she remembered in her history--of--she knew not what.
p13206
aVThe thoughts\u000athronged over her mind like clouds o\u2019er the sky, and she could take no\u000acount of them.
p13207
aVFor there could be no king, no martyr, no prison, no\u000amadhouse here.
p13208
aVWho was it?
p13209
aVWho was it?
p13210
aVIn a house in St. John\u2019s Wood,\u000athe most respectable, the most perfectly well-known and\u000awell-established, in the midst of the quiet, within the tranquil garden,\u000asurrounded by all the decorums of society.
p13211
aVWho--oh, who could it be?
p13212
aVShe stood transfixed, not thinking that she herself in the midst of that\u000awhite light, a little dark figure, all surrounded and isolated by the\u000abrightness, was more clearly distinguishable than anything about her,\u000aand, indeed, could scarcely fail to catch the eye of any one that might\u000abe looking.
p13213
aVJanet did not think of this, her whole mind being occupied\u000awith her extraordinary discovery.
p13214
aVShe was afraid of being seen.
p13215
aVShe\u000anever realized the possibility--until suddenly, all in a moment as she\u000astood and gazed, her whole bewildered being lost in wonder and amaze,\u000ashe discovered, with a second shock even more potent than the first,\u000athat the face in the window had changed its direction and turned towards\u000aherself.
p13216
aVWhether it was that Janet was too terrified to have the\u000astrength to fly, or whether that she was not so terrified as she\u000athought, and more eager, more curious than she was frightened, it is\u000acertain that, though she shrank back a step upon herself, she did not\u000arun away, but stood there gazing with her heart in her mouth, and the\u000asensation tingling through and through her that not only did she see\u000athis extraordinary being, a real person, whoever he was, but that he saw\u000aher.
p13217
aVThe head, with its white hair, turned slowly from contemplating the\u000asky to contemplating her.
p13218
aVHe began to make signs to her, beckoning,\u000abending forward, till the crown of white hair was pressed against the\u000apane, and seemed to sparkle and reflect, as if those patriarchal locks\u000ahad been spun glass, the hard white blaze of the moon.
p13219
aVJanet felt as if\u000ashe could neither move nor breathe.
p13220
aVIt was real--it was not a dream--it\u000awas a man shut up there, who saw her, made signs, called for her\u000ahelp--an old man--a man in trouble.
p13221
aVHer head seemed to go round, though\u000aher feet were planted on the path as if they had grown to it, or frozen\u000athere.
p13222
aVWhat was she to do?
p13223
aVWhat could she do?
p13224
aVAt this moment there came from within, from the room whence there stole\u000aa ray or two of yellow lamp-light out into the whiteness of the moon,\u000athe sound of music--a few notes--tremulous notes--with which she was\u000avery familiar; and then rising together the two voices, also so\u000afamiliar, every tone of which she could have anticipated.
p13225
aVThe sound made\u000aa diversion in her thoughts.
p13226
aVShe turned her head for a minute that way\u000awith a thrill of sensation, wondering if they could but see what she\u000asaw--if they only knew!
p13227
aVIt was so strange to realize, as she did, with\u000aa sudden flash of consciousness, the tranquil room, the mother in her\u000achair with her mild face full of gratification and reflected pleasure\u000aturned towards the pair at the piano in perfect composure and ease--the\u000atwo singers busy with their music, with themselves, thinking of nothing\u000aelse.
p13228
aVShe took her eyes from the window in her startled realization of\u000aall this, and turned her head for a moment in the direction of those\u000aunconscious people, who did not know---- In that moment, while her eyes\u000awere averted, the air was suddenly rent, torn asunder, cleft by the same\u000awild, unnatural, and awful cry which Janet had twice heard before.
p13229
aVHer\u000afeet, which had seemed growing to the path, were loosened with a spring,\u000aand Janet too uttered a scream which she could not restrain.
p13230
aVWhere was\u000ait?
p13231
aVThough she was wild with terror, she had yet sense enough left to\u000asee that the figure at the window had altered its position, and that it\u000awas from thence that the sound came.
p13232
aVBut her strength was equal to no\u000amore.
p13233
aVShe fled, forgetting all precautions, her feet flying over the\u000ahard path to the open door.
p13234
aVShe was dimly aware that the music had\u000awavered, half stopped, and then gone on again, Gussy\u2019s voice coming out\u000aloudly upon the night.
p13235
aVAfter that Janet knew no more.
p13236
aVShe burst into the\u000ahouse, and stood panting in the hall, recovering her breath, not knowing\u000awhat to do.
p13237
aVWhat was she to do?
p13238
aVShe stood leaning against the wall inside, safe from\u000apursuit.
p13239
aVAnd it was not till some time later that it occurred to her\u000athat, instead of being safe from pursuit, she was within the very walls\u000aof the house which inclosed the mystery, and that the prisoner, the\u000amaniac, whoever he was, the pale old man with the white hair, was an\u000ainmate of the same dwelling, and therefore she was within his reach far\u000amore easily than she had been outside.
p13240
aVBut this in her panic she did not\u000athink of.
p13241
aVFor the moment she felt securely sheltered, and stood gasping,\u000arecovering her breath, asking herself what she should do.
p13242
aVThey were\u000asinging in the drawing-room, singing as if all was right, as if nothing\u000acould ever be wrong.
p13243
aVHad they not heard it?
p13244
aVDid they not care?
p13245
aVThey had\u000anot seen as she had, but how could they remain unconscious after that\u000acry?
p13246
aVShould she walk in and tell them--tell them?
p13247
aVWhat should she tell\u000athem?
p13248
aVThat there was some one shut up in the wing--an old man with white\u000ahair, with his pallid face pressed against the window between the\u000abranches of the ivy?
p13249
aVHow could she go and tell them this?
p13250
aV\u201cMrs.
p13251
aVHarwood,\u000athere is a man--an old man--at the window--in the wing----\u201d Was that\u000awhat she should say?
p13252
aVSome door might have been open and some madman got\u000ain.
p13253
aVBut then it was not the first time she had heard that cry.
p13254
aVHe must\u000ahave been there for some time--he must have been there before she\u000aherself came.
p13255
aVPerhaps--perhaps--how could she tell?--perhaps Mrs.\u000aHarwood already knew--perhaps---- Janet panted and gasped, but after a\u000atime got back her breath.
p13256
aVBut still she stood there thinking, wondering\u000aover her problem.
p13257
aVWhat was she to do?
p13258
aVWas it, perhaps, her part to do\u000anothing--to ignore this sight she had seen--to try to forget it?
p13259
aVWas it\u000anone of her business to interfere?
p13260
aVWas it her duty to tell at once her\u000aappalling discovery?
p13261
aVWhat was she to do?
p13262
aVIn the meantime she had not closed the door, which still stood open,\u000aletting in the cold air of the night; and presently, while she still\u000astood trembling, steps approached from the servants\u2019 quarters.
p13263
aVIt was\u000aVicars who made his appearance, and Janet almost had a new shock of\u000aterror as the man to whom she had never spoken before came up and looked\u000aat her severely with suspicious eyes.
p13264
aVHe asked, in a tone as severe as\u000ahis look,\u000a\u000a\u201cWas it you, miss, as left the hall door open, to give everybody their\u000adeath?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI--I found it open,\u201d Janet said, faltering.
p13265
aV\u201cIf a person finds a door open of a cold night it\u2019s their part, if\u000athey\u2019ve any sense, to shut it,\u201d said Vicars.
p13266
aVHe never removed his look\u000afrom her, fixing her with the eyes of a judge.
p13267
aV\u201cMay I ask, miss, if it\u2019s\u000ayour custom to go ranging about the grounds at this hour of the night?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, no,\u201d said Janet, \u201cit was only an accident.
p13268
aVI never did it before.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am only a servant,\u201d said Vicars, \u201cbut if I was the master I wouldn\u2019t\u000ahold with folks going round and round of my house in the middle of the\u000anight looking things up.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have not been looking anything up,\u201d said Janet, indignantly.
p13269
aVShe\u000astood by while he closed the door; but when he turned to go away, made a\u000astep after him timidly.
p13270
aV\u201cOh!\u201d she said, \u201cif you would only let me speak\u000ato you for a moment.
p13271
aVMr. Vicars, you said you were a servant----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDid you take me for the master, miss?\u201d he said, with a low laugh.
p13272
aV\u201cOh!\u201d said Janet, \u201cif you would but tell me.
p13273
aVWho is the old gentleman at\u000athe window with the white hair?
p13274
aVAnd why does he cry so?
p13275
aVI will never,\u000anever say a word if you will but tell me.
p13276
aVI am so frightened, I don\u2019t\u000aknow what to do.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is no gentleman at the window--and he don\u2019t cry,\u201d said Vicars,\u000afixing her once more with keen eyes.
p13277
aV\u201cBut I saw him--and I\u2019ve heard him, oh!
p13278
aVthree times.
p13279
aVMr. Vicars, tell\u000ame, for goodness\u2019 sake, does Mrs. Harwood know?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou\u2019d best go and tell her, and see what she\u2019ll say.
p13280
aVYou\u2019ll not stop\u000aanother night in this house if you bother the missus with what you hear\u000aand see.
p13281
aVYou may take my word for it, Miss Peep and Pry.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are very impertinent,\u201d said Janet, indignantly, \u201cand I do not care\u000ain the least whether I stop here another night or not.
p13282
aVDoes Mrs. Harwood\u000aknow?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019d advise you, miss, not to offer her no information,\u201d said Vicars,\u000a\u201cabout things as happen in her own house;\u201d and with this he turned his\u000aback on Janet, and went deliberately away.
p13283
aVShould she go and tell Mrs. Harwood what she had seen?
p13284
aVShe turned\u000atowards the drawing-room door, which was so close at hand; but she\u000apaused again before she had opened it.
p13285
aVHad Vicars remained there she\u000awould certainly have done it; but as he was gone, and as there was\u000anobody to see, Janet hesitated, pondered--and, finally, though with a\u000abeating heart, and every nerve in her body thrilling, went away in the\u000aother direction, and very softly and slowly, hesitating at every second\u000astep, retired upstairs.
p13286
aVCHAPTER XXI.
p13287
aVEvery family has a skeleton in some closet.
p13288
aVSo says the proverb; but is\u000ait true?
p13289
aVWe are all of us aware of many cases in which it is not true.
p13290
aVTo half of the world perhaps it is a foolish fiction.
p13291
aVThey have\u000atroubles, but they are above-board, straightforward troubles upon which\u000atheir neighbors can offer sympathy.
p13292
aVThackeray speaks of the wife or the\u000ahusband in their intimate domesticity going back secretly, each unknown\u000ato the other, perhaps upon a youthful past which contained another image\u000athan that of the legitimate partner of their days, but that is a gentle\u000asort of a skeleton, its bones all covered in soft rounded outlines of\u000aimagination.
p13293
aVThe real skeleton is very different: it haunts the house in\u000athe form perhaps of a ruined son, a debased and degraded brother, still\u000amore dreadful a woman disgraced.
p13294
aVOr it is an incipient madness--a\u000adreadful disease of which the miserable people never know at what moment\u000ait may blaze forth?
p13295
aVIt is always in the minds of those to whom it\u000abelongs.
p13296
aVIn the midst of laughter, in the happiest moment, it gives a\u000atug at their hearts, as if it held them in a chain, and the smile fades,\u000aand the sweetest tints grow gray.
p13297
aVBut how could there be anything like this in the house in St. John\u2019s\u000aWood?
p13298
aVThe Harwoods were people not given to excitement of any kind.
p13299
aVThey\u000awere too orderly in mind, too calm and well-balanced, for any emotion.
p13300
aVTheir daily round of life was comfort itself, unbroken by any pangs of\u000aanxiety.
p13301
aVNo, Mrs. Harwood was a little anxious lest Dolff should stay\u000aout too late, and showed it in a natural, motherly way.
p13302
aVHer brow got a\u000alittle pucker in it when he did not return at the time he was expected;\u000aand Gussy had a way of going upstairs to the staircase window, from\u000awhich she could see, over the garden wall, the road outside, to look out\u000afor him.
p13303
aVThis was visible enough to those who had eyes to see.
p13304
aVBut a\u000amystery in the house, a secret inhabitant, a prisoner---- It was\u000aincredible; it was a thing that could not be.
p13305
aVJanet lay awake for a great part of the night tossing and trembling in\u000aher bed.
p13306
aVShe had locked her door, and she kept her light burning,\u000afrightened, she knew not for what, for the old man with the pale face,\u000awho might appear at any moment, and congeal the blood in her veins.
p13307
aVJanet, of course, argued with herself in every way, that if there was\u000aany old man in the wing he was evidently shut up there and guarded and\u000avery unlikely to be seen outside; that there was no reason to suppose\u000athat he would know where her room was and come to her; that perhaps it\u000awas no old man at all, or a mere visitor to Vicars, or a hallucination,\u000aor--she knew not what.
p13308
aVBut all these reflections were not enough to calm\u000athe beating of her heart.
p13309
aVShe heard Dolff come in from his ball and was\u000acomforted by the sound of voices, which gave a feeling of security: but\u000athese sounds died away again after a few minutes, and the silence and\u000athe darkness settled down.
p13310
aVIt seemed to Janet that the night had endured\u000afor ages before she got to sleep.
p13311
aVPerhaps, however, it was not so very\u000alate, after all, for she was quite unused to watching.
p13312
aVIt was, however, late when she sprang up in the morning, finding that\u000ashe had overslept herself and too busy in her hurry to think of anything\u000afor the first half-hour.
p13313
aVThen all that she had seen suddenly flashed\u000aover her mind again, and she uttered an involuntary cry.
p13314
aVShe leaned back\u000ain the chair and closed her eyes, and saw again in her mind\u2019s eye the\u000aapparition of the previous night.
p13315
aVJanet started up again and gave a wild\u000alook round her, wondering whether she should not pack up at once and go\u000aaway.
p13316
aVIf she had been one of the happy girls who have a mother to go\u000ato!--but all the possibilities rushed through her mind in a moment.
p13317
aVThe\u000aexplanations she would have to give, the mild suspicion at the vicarage,\u000athe milder remonstrances, \u201cBut, my dear!--when you were so happy; a\u000aface at the window!
p13318
aVThere might be a dozen ways of explaining it; and\u000awhat had she to do with it, when all was said?
p13319
aV\u201cJanet, what\u2019s the matter?
p13320
aVJanet, let me in.
p13321
aVWhy, you have your door\u000alocked!
p13322
aVJanet, Janet, are you ill?
p13323
aVYou\u2019re late for breakfast and\u000aeverybody\u2019s down.
p13324
aVJa--anet!\u201d\u000a\u000aThis was Julia beating a tattoo upon the door.
p13325
aV\u201cThere is nothing the matter,\u201d said Janet, faltering; \u201cI have overslept\u000amyself.
p13326
aVI shall be down directly.
p13327
aVGo away, Julia, please.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI sha\u2019n\u2019t go away.
p13328
aVI\u2019ll wait here for you.
p13329
aVI suppose Dolff woke you up\u000acoming home in the middle of the night.
p13330
aVMake haste, make haste, Janet,\u000aor Gussy will say something nasty about people who are so easily put\u000aout.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJulia, please go away.
p13331
aVI am coming; I--have got a headache.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was not often that Janet had recourse to a headache, which is always\u000athe most ready of excuses.
p13332
aVBut Julia, though she had been subdued by her\u000agoverness, was not yet a model of subordination.
p13333
aVJanet could hear her\u000aseat herself noisily on the other side of the door to wait.
p13334
aVShe could\u000ahear her foot drumming impatiently upon the floor, and then Ju, by way\u000aof amusing herself, began to give forth discordantly one of Dolff\u2019s not\u000avery lovely songs.
p13335
aVIt was quite true that Julia was never likely to do\u000amuch in music.
p13336
aVHer voice was something like that of a crow.
p13337
aVShe chanted\u000aDolff\u2019s song with a very perverted reminiscence of the air, but a\u000aperfect memory for the words, which were not admirable.
p13338
aVJanet was called\u000aback by this performance to the recollection of her duties.
p13339
aVIt was not\u000apossible now to pack up and hurry off.
p13340
aVAnd then she became conscious of\u000aa great many threads that held her, as well as this sentinel with her\u000asong keeping watch over her door.
p13341
aVThey went down together, though Julia did not fail to impress upon the\u000agoverness a due sense of the fact that she herself had been ready nearly\u000aan hour ago.
p13342
aV\u201cYou should always get up the moment you\u2019re called, or you are done\u000afor,\u201d said Julia; \u201cone says just five minutes more, and when one wakes\u000aone finds it\u2019s an hour.
p13343
aVI\u2019ve learned all that about the kings, which is\u000arubbish.
p13344
aVWhat do I want with all those old kings?
p13345
aVI shall just forget\u000athem the moment I\u2019ve said them.
p13346
aVI learned it not because I approved of\u000ait, but merely to please you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThank you, my dear, that was a very kind motive,\u201d said Janet, recalling\u000aherself to her duties, \u201cbut if there is one thing that you ought to know\u000ait is the history of your own country.
p13347
aVEverybody will tell you that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell!\u201d said Julia, \u201cif it\u2019s all about one putting out another, till you\u000adon\u2019t know which is which, or who\u2019s king and who\u2019s not, I don\u2019t call\u000athat the history of anybody\u2019s country.
p13348
aVSo long as it\u2019s just to say off\u000athe Henrys and the Edwards I don\u2019t mind; but to learn whose sons they\u000aall were, and what right they had, and why they fought each other about\u000ait, I do it to please you, Janet, but I don\u2019t care tuppence.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet also did not care tuppence either, nor a fraction of tuppence; but\u000ashe knew, and feebly tried to do her duty.
p13349
aV\u201cYou can\u2019t understand how they succeed, or which is right and which is\u000awrong, unless you know about their families,\u201d she said.
p13350
aV\u201cIt is all very\u000acomplicated in the Wars of the Roses, but it is plain sailing for a long\u000atime after that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt ought always to be plain sailing,\u201d said Julia.
p13351
aV\u201cThe Prince of Wales\u000acomes after the Queen, and Prince George of York after him--any one can\u000aunderstand that.
p13352
aVIf it went quite straight--father and son, or mother\u000aand son when there\u2019s a queen--I shouldn\u2019t mind; but they just inverted\u000athings to make history difficult, with no other reason.
p13353
aVIf they had only\u000alet Richard the Second alone, he would have had a son after a\u000awhile--Richard the Third, perhaps--and we could have skipped all that\u000anasty bit.
p13354
aVBut those old people had no consideration.
p13355
aVOf course, it\u000astands to nature that the son should always come after the father.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is most edifying,\u201d said Gussy, for by this time they had arrived\u000aat the breakfast-table.
p13356
aV\u201cYou are late, young ladies, but if you come in\u000adiscussing historical questions it is clear you must have been making a\u000agood use of your time.
p13357
aVGood-morning, Janet; I hear you were\u000adisturbed--by Dolff or something last night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo!\u201d said Janet, faltering a little, \u201cI heard Mr. Harwood come in, but\u000aI was not disturbed.
p13358
aVIt is pleasant to hear voices and people stirring\u000awhen one can\u2019t sleep.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou left us in a great hurry last night,\u201d said Gussy.
p13359
aV\u201cI am afraid\u000asomething put you out.
p13360
aVYou must not think you are neglected if, when a\u000avisitor happens to come---- I am sure there was no such intention.
p13361
aVWe\u000aalways like, in this family, to see everybody comfortable, but\u000asometimes, you know, there are circumstances----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed, indeed, I was not put out by anything,\u201d said Janet.
p13362
aVShe had\u000areally forgotten all about Meredith and the small commotions of the\u000adrawing-room.
p13363
aV\u201cI had--a headache,\u201d she added, by an afterthought.
p13364
aV\u201cI don\u2019t wonder, after thumping out all those accompaniments for Dolff.
p13365
aVWe must not let you be victimized so much.
p13366
aVAnd you ran out to have a\u000aturn in the garden.
p13367
aVIt is very tempting on a moonlight night, but there\u000ais nothing that gives cold so easily.
p13368
aVYou must really take care.
p13369
aVYou\u000alook,\u201d said Gussy, raising her eyes full upon Janet, \u201crather pale, and\u000ashivering as if you had caught cold.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat was this in Gussy\u2019s eyes?
p13370
aVsomething more than their usual\u000aplacidity--an inquiry, an examination, almost a menace--they seemed to\u000aask where the other had been, what she had been doing, what she had\u000aseen.
p13371
aVJanet felt herself shiver under the look.
p13372
aV\u201cI am sure you have caught cold; you ought to stay in and take care of\u000ayourself to-day.
p13373
aVI am sure my mother would wish you to nurse yourself\u000aup.
p13374
aVJu, you must see there is a good fire in the school-room, and if\u000aJanet would keep to one room, without exposing herself to any draughts\u000ato-day, she will probably be quite well to-morrow.
p13375
aVThat\u2019s what I always\u000ado when I feel a cold coming on.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut I don\u2019t think I have any cold----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, yes, I can see it in your eyes; they are beginning to run.
p13376
aVYou must\u000atake care of yourself, my dear.
p13377
aVAnd you really must promise to give up\u000athis habit of running out into the garden on a cold night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Janet, \u201cI never did it before.
p13378
aVThe door was open, and the\u000amoon was shining so brightly----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, the door was open!
p13379
aVI wonder, now, who could be so silly as to leave\u000athe door open in December?
p13380
aVI must ask about that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was me, I suppose,\u201d said Julia.
p13381
aV\u201cI was standing there when Charley\u000aMeredith came.
p13382
aVAnd I wasn\u2019t at all glad to see him.
p13383
aVSo I turned round in\u000adisgust, and forgot all about the door.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are very impertinent to say so!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, I\u2019ve just as good a right to my own opinion as you have, Gussy; as\u000amuch as you like him, so much I don\u2019t; and I should never open the door\u000aat all to him if I had my will.
p13384
aVHe\u2019s not nice at all, or true.
p13385
aVHe has\u000aalways mocked at me and made eyes, and I can\u2019t bear him,\u201d said Julia,\u000athrough her teeth.
p13386
aV\u201cJu!
p13387
aVI thought you had learned a little sense.
p13388
aVI thought Miss\u000aSummerhayes had taught you how to behave, though your own family never\u000acould.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, I am quite sick and tired of my own family,\u201d cried Julia.
p13389
aV\u201cMamma\u000adoes whatever you please, Gussy.
p13390
aVAnd you\u2019re so silly, I could shake you\u000asometimes.
p13391
aVAnd Dolff--Dolff----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat of Dolff?
p13392
aVIt must be delightful for a stranger to hear what we\u000athink of each other.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat do you mean by calling her Miss Summerhayes and a stranger, when\u000ayou know it was settled she was to be like one of ourselves--and by far\u000athe best of us?\u201d cried Julia, with flushed cheeks and blazing eyes.
p13393
aV\u201cMiss Summerhayes,\u201d said Gussy, turning again upon Janet, with a wave of\u000aher hand towards the indignant Julia, \u201cI think your pupil is not doing\u000ayou much credit to-day.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet had more command of herself in the family squabble than she had in\u000athe previous question.
p13394
aV\u201cJulia has forgotten herself,\u201d she said.
p13395
aV\u201cShe will be very sorry for it\u000aby-and-bye.
p13396
aVI hope you will forgive her.
p13397
aVShe cannot quite get over her\u000aquick temper all at once.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope she won\u2019t wear out our patience altogether before she does so,\u201d\u000aGussy said, with significant calm.
p13398
aV\u201cJanet!
p13399
aVshe means she\u2019ll persuade my mother to send me to school.
p13400
aVMamma\u000awould never do it of her own will.
p13401
aVBut if Gussy goes on nagging and\u000anagging---- But I\u2019ll not go.
p13402
aVI\u2019ll run away.
p13403
aVI am too old to be packed\u000aoff like a child.
p13404
aVI\u2019ll----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt would do you a great deal of good, Julia, to go to school,\u201d said\u000aJanet, sedately.
p13405
aV\u201cI have always said so,\u201d said Gussy, \u201cand it\u2019s very good of you, Janet,\u000ato back me up.
p13406
aVI have a temper, perhaps, too, and I say what I don\u2019t\u000amean when I\u2019m angry.
p13407
aVBut please don\u2019t think that I have ever changed\u000aabout you.
p13408
aVI liked you from the first, and I shall always like you.
p13409
aVThat\u000alittle vixen makes one say things--but I know that we owe a great deal\u000ato you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, no,\u201d cried Janet, with a compunction in her heart.
p13410
aVShe was not sure that she could return the kind words and declare that\u000ashe would never change.
p13411
aVShe felt as if involuntarily she was a traitor\u000ato Gussy--in a complot against her--or at least in the confidence of the\u000aplotter.
p13412
aVAnd she was glad to retire into the shelter of her supposed\u000acold and withdraw for the day to the school-room, carrying the excited\u000aJulia with her, to whom Miss Summerhayes set forth her offences against\u000agood taste and decorum with an incisiveness and distinctness which soon\u000areduced that young lady to the depths of self-contempt.
p13413
aVCHAPTER XXII.
p13414
aVThe day had been rainy, some time after these occurrences, and the\u000agoverness and her pupil were taking their needful exercise in the\u000agarden--up one side and down the other under the bare trees.
p13415
aVThey\u000atrudged along, making a sharp noise upon the wet gravel with their\u000aheels, occasionally very fast when they thought of it in the true spirit\u000aof a constitutional, occasionally lingering when they got into a\u000adiscussion, and their tongues went faster than their feet.
p13416
aVThings had fallen into comparative tranquillity, and Janet, though far\u000afrom at ease in more respects than one, was drawn on from day to day\u000awith the force of the current, and had no idea, whatever mysteries there\u000amight lie under the surface or troubles might be to come, of packing up\u000ain a hurry and rushing away.
p13417
aVShe wanted to see what was going to\u000ahappen--very curious, a little disturbed, with more things going on in\u000aher little mind than were known to any philosophy.
p13418
aVJulia was the\u000agreatest talker when the two were alone, and Janet carried on her\u000athoughts and the thread of many a reflection through the girl\u2019s chatter\u000aat her ease--for Julia answered her own questions in a great many cases,\u000aor forgot that she asked any, and a very small response on the part of\u000aJanet sufficed to keep her satisfied.
p13419
aVWhat had happened, however, on this particular afternoon was that Dolff\u000ahad seen them from a window, and had sallied forth to join them.
p13420
aVDolff\u000ahad a very comfortable little study to which he retired for certain\u000ahours in the day \u201cto work\u201d--as everybody said.
p13421
aVPerhaps in her heart Mrs.\u000aHarwood had not very much more confidence than other people in Dolff\u2019s\u000awork.
p13422
aVBut she liked to say she had--to deceive, perhaps, a family friend\u000anow and then, or, what was more likely, herself.
p13423
aVDolff, however, smoking a cigarette over his work--which in this case\u000awas an old French novel--saw the two figures in the garden, and threw\u000aaside his book with as much alacrity as if it had been Aristotle.
p13424
aVHe did\u000anot much care even for a French novel: literature of any kind was not\u000ahis forte.
p13425
aVAnd it was the afternoon, in which no man, nor woman either,\u000ahas any call to work.
p13426
aVIt is going against the very rules of Providence\u000ato work between four and five o\u2019clock, and you cannot disregard these\u000alaws with impunity.
p13427
aVNothing that is done between these hours is ever\u000agood.
p13428
aVIf it is reading, it runs out of your memory as fast as you put\u000ait in; if it is writing, it is so bad that next morning you tear the\u000apaper across and throw it into the fire.
p13429
aVDolff was deeply sensible of\u000athis penalty of untimely labor.
p13430
aVHe threw his book aside, picked up his\u000acap, and went downstairs.
p13431
aVA walk in the garden before tea, which was a\u000arefreshment his mother liked him to share, was exactly what was needed\u000ato keep him up to the mark.
p13432
aVIt is difficult to say how these things happen; but after Dolff joined\u000athe pair, Julia separated herself with an instinct which need not be\u000adefined.
p13433
aVShe found that two was company and three was none.
p13434
aVShe was a\u000alittle impatient at the sight of her brother when he first appeared, but\u000aafterwards accepted the situation, and began to find that she had a\u000agreat many things to distract her attention.
p13435
aVShe wanted to speak to the\u000agardener.
p13436
aVShe wanted to see whether the snowdrops were appearing which\u000agrew in the grass under the trees.
p13437
aVShe wished to look how the primulas\u000awere coming on in the little conservatory.
p13438
aVIt was well, on the whole,\u000athat Dolff had appeared to leave her free, for she could not have\u000aallowed Janet to walk alone, and yet she had all these things to do.
p13439
aVDolff was not very great at conversation, as the reader may imagine; and\u000ait was very seldom that he had found a chance of talking to Janet alone,\u000aor so nearly alone as they were now.
p13440
aVHe began with the weather, as was\u000anatural.
p13441
aVIt had been very cold.
p13442
aVThat night he went to the ball he\u000athought he should have been frozen walking home, coming out of the hot\u000arooms after dancing all night.
p13443
aVIt was a beautiful moonlight night,\u000aindeed, as Miss Summerhayes remarked--but dreadfully cold.
p13444
aV\u201cI hope it was a nice ball?\u201d said Janet.
p13445
aV\u201cOh, yes; it was a nice enough ball, but I did not know very many\u000apeople.
p13446
aVI wish you had been there, Miss Summerhayes; but perhaps you\u000adon\u2019t care for that sort of thing?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed I do,\u201d said Janet.
p13447
aV\u201cI am very fond of dancing.
p13448
aVAt least, I used\u000ato be when I was in the way of it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope you are not out of the way of it now.
p13449
aVWe must have a dance at\u000aChristmas.
p13450
aVI am sure you dance to perfection, Miss Summerhayes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, no,\u201d said Janet, with a laugh.
p13451
aV\u201cI don\u2019t do anything to perfection,\u000abut I confess I am fond of dancing.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd of music, too,\u201d said the grateful Dolff.
p13452
aV\u201cI know you are--good\u000amusic, not my sort.
p13453
aVAnd yet you are so very kind as to play for me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, please don\u2019t speak so.
p13454
aVI am very glad to play--for anyone.
p13455
aVEverybody is very kind to me.
p13456
aVI am here to be of any use I can.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope, Miss Summerhayes,\u201d said Dolff, growing very red, \u201cthat you\u000adon\u2019t think I would presume to ask you--on that ground.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t mean anything disagreeable,\u201d said Janet.
p13457
aV\u201cI am sure you don\u2019t\u000aask me because I am the governess.
p13458
aVBut if your mother makes me like one\u000aof the family in other things, I must be so in this too.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow strange it is!\u201d cried Dolff; and then he added, growing redder,\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t be angry with me, Miss Summerhayes.
p13459
aVTo think that being one of\u000aour family should be anything to you!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy not?\u201d said Janet.
p13460
aV\u201cIt is always a great thing for a governess to\u000ahave such a kind home.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA governess!\u201d he said.
p13461
aV\u201cIt hurts me to hear you call yourself a\u000agoverness.
p13462
aVDon\u2019t, oh, don\u2019t, please!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy not?\u201d she said again, and laughed.
p13463
aV\u201cIt does not hurt me at all.
p13464
aVI\u000ahave no objection to being a governess.
p13465
aVYou need not be so careful of my\u000afeelings.
p13466
aVI am quite contented to be what I am.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is because you are----\u201d Dolff murmured something in his young\u000amoustache, and grew redder than ever.
p13467
aVJanet was not sure that it was not \u2018an angel\u2019; and she was very much\u000aamused--not displeased either.
p13468
aVThere is no harm in being well thought\u000aof.
p13469
aVShe liked it on the whole.
p13470
aV\u201cIt is because I had--nothing else to look for,\u201d she said; \u201cand I am not\u000aa discontented person.
p13471
aVOne can always get a little fun out of\u000aeverything.
p13472
aVIt was rather fun coming out like this upon the world, not\u000aknowing what sort of place one might find oneself in.
p13473
aVIt is the nearest\u000ato beginning a brand-new life of anything I know.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, about fun I can\u2019t tell,\u201d said Dolff, a little abashed.
p13474
aV\u201cI--I hope\u000ayou think there is a little more in us than that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a great deal more,\u201d said Janet, \u201coh, a great deal more.
p13475
aVYou\u000ahave all been so good.
p13476
aVI mean before I came that it was fun imagining\u000awhat my new family would be like, and how I should get on, and what sort\u000aof a pupil I should have, and all that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI daresay,\u201d said Dolff, \u201cyou never thought there would be a cub of a\u000abrother to bother you with his vulgar songs--oh, I know they\u2019re\u000avulgar--at least, I know now.
p13477
aVA set of men, you know, is different.
p13478
aVWe\u000abellow them out at each other\u2019s rooms, and make an awful row in the\u000achorus, and think them jolly.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd so they are, I suppose,\u201d said Janet, with a smile.
p13479
aV\u201cI assure you,\u201d said Dolff, \u201cI don\u2019t think so now.
p13480
aVI have been getting\u000amore and more ashamed of them, Miss Summerhayes.
p13481
aVI\u2019ve gone on singing\u000athem just for the pleasure of your playing.
p13482
aVBut I\u2019ll not do it any\u000amore.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI cannot see why you should give up what is a pleasure to you,\u201d said\u000aJanet.
p13483
aV\u201cIf you think I dislike playing for you, it is not so at all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re so good and charitable; they\u2019re not fit for you\u000ato touch.
p13484
aVI can see that now.
p13485
aVIn a roomful of men that are thinking of\u000anothing but noise and diversion, such things are all very well; but for\u000ayour hands to touch, no, no--I see it all now.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere was in Dolff\u2019s voice a tone of touching regret.
p13486
aVHe felt the\u000asacrifice he was making, yet he was ready to lay it at the feet of his\u000alady.
p13487
aVBetween amusement and a certain pleasure in his devotion Janet\u2019s\u000acountenance shone.
p13488
aV\u201cI can\u2019t allow you,\u201d she said, \u201cto make such a sacrifice.
p13489
aVYou must have\u000asomething to amuse you in the evenings; and your mother likes to hear\u000ayou sing.
p13490
aVNever mind if they are a little--well!
p13491
aVsome of them are quite\u000anice--they are not all vulgar.
p13492
aVI will show you the ones I like best.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWill you be so very, very kind to me, Miss Summerhayes?
p13493
aVIt is out of\u000athe goodness of your heart, I know.
p13494
aVYes, my mother likes it, and she has\u000agood reason.
p13495
aVI used always to be going out of nights getting into bad\u000acompany.
p13496
aVI can tell _you_, Miss Janet, though I could not tell anyone\u000aelse.
p13497
aVPoor mother was anxious about me, of course.
p13498
aVBut now I have no\u000awish to go out at night.
p13499
aVThe Strand may be in Timbuctoo for anything I\u000acare.
p13500
aVI never want to spend an evening away from home.
p13501
aVSo long as you\u000awill go on playing them--the best of them, don\u2019t you know--you will make\u000aboth mother and me happy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell,\u201d said Janet, \u201cit is very easily done: and there are some others\u000athat I think would suit your voice.
p13502
aVWe might go over them together.\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff turned quickly round as if he would have seized her hand, but\u000aoverawed by the imposing vision of Janet, who met his eager look with a\u000aslight elevation of her head and withdrawal from his side, drew back\u000aagain a little shyly.
p13503
aVBut he was beaming with happiness and gratitude.
p13504
aV\u201cIf you will do that for me, Miss Summerhayes,\u201d he said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell\u000ayou how happy you will make me.\u201d He paused a moment, and then gave vent\u000ato a laugh.
p13505
aV\u201cGussy and Meredith may think they\u2019re very grand,\u201d he said;\u000a\u201cthey look down upon me as if I was a clown at the circus; but just you\u000astand by me, Miss Summerhayes,\u201d he said, with a little break in his\u000avoice; \u201cby Jove, we\u2019ll put them on their mettle!\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff was so delighted with the future joys which he saw before him\u000athat he smote his manly thigh in exultation.
p13506
aVHis face was crimsoned with\u000apleasure and satisfaction, shining behind the faint shadows thrown upon\u000ait by his colorless hair and light mustache.
p13507
aVHe was happy and he was\u000aproud, doubly repaid for the genuine humility which had prompted his\u000asacrifice.
p13508
aVJanet had made him feel his coarseness and imperfection.
p13509
aVIt\u000awas with all the greater exultation that he felt himself mounting up\u000awith her into a higher place.
p13510
aV\u201cYou must remember, Mr. Harwood,\u201d said Janet, \u201cthat Mr. Meredith has a\u000abeautiful voice.
p13511
aVThere are not many people that have a voice like that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d said Dolff, somewhat crestfallen.
p13512
aV\u201cHe thinks a\u000adeal of it himself, I know.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA man cannot have a voice like that,\u201d said Janet, \u201cwithout knowing it.
p13513
aVI will do my very best for you, but no one can give you a voice like\u000athat.
p13514
aVAnd your sister sings very well, too.
p13515
aVI think I could help her a\u000alittle--but she doesn\u2019t think so, which is a pity.
p13516
aVBut you cannot do as\u000awell as that, Mr. Harwood--oh, no, whatever we may do.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d said Dolff, magnanimously, \u201cso long as you back me up,\u000aMiss Summerhayes.
p13517
aVIf you\u2019re pleased, that\u2019s all I care for.
p13518
aVI know you\u000adon\u2019t like Meredith, I\u2019ve seen it in your eyes.
p13519
aVWe\u2019ll have concerts of\u000aour own, and my mother will like it, for one, better than twenty\u000aMerediths.
p13520
aVAnd Gussy can\u2019t hold a candle to you--not in any way.
p13521
aVDo you\u000athink I am so stupid that I can\u2019t be trusted to see that?\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet\u2019s mind was a little excited by this conversation.
p13522
aVAn uninterrupted\u000acourse of adulation is not a disagreeable thing altogether: even if we\u000ado not have a very high opinion to begin with of the genius of the\u000aperson who expresses it, our idea of his judgment will probably improve\u000awhen we see how he appreciates our merits.
p13523
aVJanet was no doubt more or\u000aless influenced by this natural sentiment; but she was also a little\u000ashaken by his confidence in respect to Meredith.
p13524
aVI know you don\u2019t like him--was it true?
p13525
aVShe felt herself pulled up short\u000aby that unhesitating expression.
p13526
aVI know you don\u2019t like Meredith.
p13527
aVIt gave\u000aher heart a quicker beat: it was like the drawing up of a curtain upon a\u000ascene--a scene very much confused and covered with clouds, but not what\u000aher companion in ignorance of her and of all things had made sure it\u000awas.
p13528
aVThe curtain divided, opened for a moment, and then the folds fell\u000aback again, leaving her not much the wiser.
p13529
aVNo, not much the wiser; but\u000anot at least as Dolff supposed.
p13530
aVAfter all he was a lout, though he\u000aadmired her so much, which was a sign of good taste; but to take it for\u000agranted that he understood her was a little too much.
p13531
aVAlso, it was\u000aquite time to change the subject.
p13532
aVHe might rush upon her at any moment\u000awith other words that it might not be easy to answer.
p13533
aVDecidedly the\u000asubject must be changed.
p13534
aVShe turned round upon him quite suddenly,\u000athough not without a little conscious artifice.
p13535
aV\u201cMr.
p13536
aVHarwood,\u201d she said, \u201cI want you to tell me one thing.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA hundred things, Miss Summerhayes; as many as you like.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, it is just this.
p13537
aVDo you put full confidence in Mr. Vicars?\u201d she\u000asaid, looking him full in the face.
p13538
aV\u201cMr.
p13539
aVVicars,\u201d cried Dolff, with the most comical expression of\u000aastonishment and dismay.
p13540
aVHe had thought, poor fellow, that he was\u000a\u201cgetting on very well\u201d with Miss Summerhayes; he had felt himself able\u000ato speak to her as he never had been able to speak before.
p13541
aVYes, and she\u000ahad understood him, agreed to what he had scarcely ventured to ask, and,\u000athough she had not flattered him (which was so much greater a compliment\u000ahe had said to himself somewhat ruefully), had at least seemed willing\u000ato help him--to stand by him.
p13542
aVDecidedly he had been getting on; but what\u000ain the world could she mean by this sudden _volte-face_.
p13543
aV\u201cMr.
p13544
aVVicars!\u201d\u000ahe repeated, with amaze; then slowly dawning into understanding.
p13545
aV\u201cOld\u000aVicars?\u201d he said; \u201cthe old butler?\u201d then Dolff paused to laugh.
p13546
aV\u201cYou\u000astartled me so, I could not think what you meant.
p13547
aVDo I put confidence in\u000ahim?
p13548
aVWell, I suppose so--that is--I can\u2019t tell.
p13549
aVI know very little about\u000ahim; but my mother does, I have always heard.
p13550
aVDo you--take any interest\u000ain Vicars, Miss Summerhayes?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, no,\u201d said Janet.
p13551
aV\u201cI thought as he was such an old servant you must\u000aknow him very well.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSo I do,\u201d said Dolff, \u201cand yet I don\u2019t.
p13552
aVI have not been much at\u000ahome--only for the holidays when I was at school, and now only for\u000avacations.
p13553
aVAnd half the time we were always away at the seaside or\u000asomewhere.
p13554
aVIt is strange how little a fellow is at home when he is\u000ayoung, though of course when one is the only man of the family, and all\u000athat, I suppose you think I ought to pay some attention to things at my\u000aage.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, it was only an idle question,\u201d Janet said.
p13555
aV\u201cBut I should like you to know: everything is in my mother\u2019s hands for\u000aher life.
p13556
aVThat is--not everything.
p13557
aVI have the most of the money, but not\u000atill I\u2019m twenty-five: and she has the house and all the management.
p13558
aVOf\u000acourse I ought to pay more attention; and if I was to marry, or that\u000asort of thing, I should have to settle up, and I don\u2019t know that she\u000awould have enough left to keep up this house.
p13559
aVI have never thought of\u000amarrying till--quite lately; and I\u2019ve always left everything in her\u000ahands and never interfered.
p13560
aVDo you think I ought to pay more attention,\u000aMiss Summerhayes?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh,\u201d cried Janet, after two or three attempts to stop him, \u201cI did not\u000aindeed want you to tell me about your family matters.
p13561
aVIt was only an\u000aidle question.
p13562
aVI--I don\u2019t like the look of the man, and I only asked for\u000acuriosity.
p13563
aVI never wanted to pry into your family affairs.\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff gave her a look which was full of meaning.
p13564
aVHe drew himself up to\u000ahis full length, and instinctively pulled at his shirt-collar, and\u000asmoothed his mustache.
p13565
aV\u201cMiss Summerhayes,\u201d he said, with dignity, \u201cnever speak of prying, for\u000athat is what you could not do.
p13566
aVIt is I who wanted you to know.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER XXIII.
p13567
aV\u201cWell,\u201d said Gussy, \u201cI cannot say that I see any harm in that.
p13568
aVWe have\u000anot had anything of the kind for a long time.
p13569
aVWe must see what mamma\u000asays.
p13570
aVIt does turn the house upside down, and give a great deal of\u000atrouble.
p13571
aVBut--you know mamma always likes to do anything to please you,\u000aand make you fond of your home, Dolff----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI should like to see any fellow that is more fond of his home, or\u000asticks to it more,\u201d cried Dolff.
p13572
aV\u201cYou have been very good lately,\u201d said Gussy, in a hesitating tone, \u201cif\u000aonly one could be quite sure.\u201d\u000a\u000aGussy did not know what to think.
p13573
aVMr. Meredith\u2019s laughter and innuendoes\u000ahad opened her eyes as to the cause of the virtue of Dolff; and she did\u000anot like the persistence with which Charley came back to the subject.
p13574
aVShe had no desire to be talked to about Miss Summerhayes and her\u000ainfluence for a whole evening, even if it was by way of jest.
p13575
aVAnd as\u000aregarded the matter itself, though Gussy was quite willing to accept\u000aJanet\u2019s aid in keeping Dolff from nightly wanderings which were not for\u000ahis advantage, she did not like to be called upon to acknowledge that\u000aaid; still less to consider that it might lead to what she called\u000afurther complications: the idea of \u201cfurther complications\u201d was highly\u000adisagreeable to her.
p13576
aVJanet was very well in her way.
p13577
aVShe was good for\u000aJulia, and fortunately for Dolff too.
p13578
aVIt was a great advantage to have\u000aanyone who would keep those troublesome members of the family in order.
p13579
aVBut--the idea of further complications alarmed her very much.
p13580
aVIt was the\u000alast thing in the world that was desirable for any one concerned.
p13581
aV\u201cI shall tell my mother I have set my heart on having a dance.
p13582
aVHow can\u000ayou expect a man to stick to his home as you wish if he has nothing to\u000aamuse him?
p13583
aVI will settle all that with my mother myself,\u201d said Dolff,\u000asomewhat magisterially.
p13584
aVHe turned round upon her, however, after a\u000amoment: \u201cIf you don\u2019t interfere.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy should I interfere, if it makes you happy?
p13585
aVTo be sure it is a great\u000atrouble turning everything upside down.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOne would think you were forty, Gussy!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am not so young as you, at all events,\u201d she said.
p13586
aVGussy was as good as her word, and did not interfere.
p13587
aVEven when she was\u000aprivately consulted by her mother she said nothing against Dolff\u2019s wish.
p13588
aV\u201cIf it keeps him up to the mark,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood.
p13589
aV\u201cIt is such a\u000apleasure to see him so nice, to see him so improved--none of those\u000awanderings out at night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, it is a great improvement,\u201d said Gussy.
p13590
aVShe shook her head, with a\u000asigh, and hoped that it would last.
p13591
aV\u201cIt has lasted a month,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, \u201cI see no reason why it\u000ashould not last forever.
p13592
aVHow can I refuse him anything when he is so\u000agood?
p13593
aVVicars will not like it.
p13594
aVIt distracts his mind, and he says he\u000anever knows what may happen: but I think I can smooth down Vicars,\u000aGussy, if you are sure that you approve.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, yes, I approve,\u201d said Gussy, \u201canything to keep him steady.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Gussy herself was still young enough, and she thought of all the\u000aopportunities of the dance and the talks aside, the conversations in\u000aquiet corners, which were legitimate on such an occasion, with a little\u000astir in her heart.
p13595
aVAt the piano, even though it was at the other end of\u000athe room, it was still under her mother\u2019s eyes.
p13596
aVShe never saw her lover,\u000anever talked with him except under her mother\u2019s eyes.
p13597
aVHow could he say\u000aanything under such circumstances?
p13598
aVHer heart was a little sick that it\u000ashould all go on forever in the same way, without the least progress.
p13599
aVHe\u000atalked about the songs, or about Janet and her influence on Dolff,\u000alaughing at what he said he had foreseen from the first.
p13600
aVGussy did not\u000aquite like the discussion of her brother, who, after all, _was_ her\u000abrother, and not to be dissected as Charley loved to do, and she was not\u000afond of hearing so much about Miss Summerhayes.
p13601
aVThere was no special\u000ainterest in Miss Summerhayes that she should be the object of so much\u000aconversation between the two.
p13602
aVAnd Gussy could not help thinking with a\u000alittle pleasure of all the possibilities of the ball, where it was not\u000aonly possible that two could talk together quite untrammelled, but where\u000ait was even a necessity that they should do so.
p13603
aVTo sit apart in a room\u000aunobserved with Charley once at least in the evening would be almost her\u000aduty; and then--with nothing to disturb them, no occasion for\u000aself-restraint--Gussy thought of this with a thrill through her veins\u000ayet with a sigh.
p13604
aVShe was becoming weary.
p13605
aVAll this had gone on for so\u000along, and it looked as if it might go on forever without change.
p13606
aVCuriously enough it was the governess alone--as if she had any say in\u000athe matter!--who objected to the idea.
p13607
aVOf course she did not object in\u000awords--but she nearly wrecked the project notwithstanding.
p13608
aVShe said,\u000avery innocently, that she did not think--even though Mrs. Harwood was so\u000agood as to ask her--that she could be present.
p13609
aVThere was a great outcry\u000aover this, for it was at luncheon, and the whole family was at table.
p13610
aV\u201cNot come to the dance?\u201d said Dolff.
p13611
aV\u201cOh, but, Miss Summerhayes, that\u000awill spoil everything.
p13612
aVI have--we\u2019ve all calculated upon you, haven\u2019t\u000awe, mother.
p13613
aVTell her she must come.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, \u201cthis is quite a new idea.
p13614
aVI couldn\u2019t have\u000aa dance in the house, knowing there was a young person upstairs alone.
p13615
aVOh, no, I couldn\u2019t do it.
p13616
aVDolff is quite right--you must come.\u201d\u000a\u000aGussy had only said \u201cOh!\u201d raising her eyelids--but Janet read in that\u000aexclamation a suspicion and question.
p13617
aVGussy did not believe that she was\u000asincere, and was curious to know what her motive was.
p13618
aVThe two had\u000adrifted apart strangely, but this suspicion was not native to Miss\u000aHarwood\u2019s mind.
p13619
aVIt came from all those talks about Janet, and Dolff\u2019s\u000asubjection to her, which had afforded an opportunity for so much\u000aamusement over the piano.
p13620
aVMeredith would say, \u201cAh!
p13621
aVI wonder what she\u000ameans by that?\u201d till Gussy put the question to herself involuntarily as\u000ahe would have put it, feeling all the same that sick weariness with the\u000asubject which translated itself unjustly, but not unnaturally, into an\u000aimpatience with Janet which sometimes she could hardly restrain.
p13622
aV\u201cI should like to come,\u201d said Janet, \u201cbut you forget I am in mourning.
p13623
aVIt is not six months yet----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is true,\u201d said the old lady; but she added: \u201cMy dear, I like you\u000athe better for thinking of it.
p13624
aVBut, after all, she was not a near\u000arelation--not like your mother.
p13625
aVFor an aunt, six months\u2019 mourning is\u000aall that any one thinks of nowadays.
p13626
aVAnd I believe the late poor lady\u000awas not even an aunt.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe was all I ever had, for mother or aunt or guardian.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, I know--but left you to struggle for yourself, which makes a\u000alittle difference.
p13627
aVAnd what harm can it do her, poor thing, that you\u000ashould enjoy yourself a little?
p13628
aVYou don\u2019t get so many opportunities in\u000athis quiet house.
p13629
aVWhen Dolff goes away we shall all relapse into our\u000aneedlework again.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd Charley Meredith,\u201d said Julia.
p13630
aVThought is quicker than the most rapid utterance.
p13631
aVJulia\u2019s words came\u000ainstantaneously, almost before her mother had done speaking, but it had\u000aflashed into two different minds before she spoke.
p13632
aVAnd Charley Meredith!
p13633
aVGussy added that reflection to the picture of the future with an\u000aincreasing sickness and impatience of her heart, seeing the same thing\u000aover again stretch before her, not without happiness in it, but with a\u000aweariness and incompleteness which would grow day by day.
p13634
aVAnd it gleamed\u000ainto Janet\u2019s thoughts with a certain excitement and suspense, as of a\u000athing of which nobody could prophesy how it would end.
p13635
aVThe sudden\u000amovement in both minds was curiously struck as by a false note by Mrs.\u000aHarwood\u2019s calm reply:\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd Charley Meredith, perhaps.
p13636
aVBut that can\u2019t affect Janet, except the\u000awrong way: for I confess, myself, I get sick of these two always\u000aphilandering--I beg your pardon, Gussy, my dear, but I\u2019ve been young in\u000amy day--and other young people looking on, you know: why they must\u000aeither make fun of you or the water must come into their mouths.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe old lady laughed in the heartless way in which old ladies will\u000alaugh.
p13637
aVShe was only the more tickled when Gussy drew herself up, and,\u000alooking straight before her with a blank countenance and the sternest\u000agravity, replied,\u000a\u000a\u201cI cannot form the slightest idea what you mean, mamma, or what there is\u000ain anything that has been said to call forth such a digression.
p13638
aVWe were\u000aspeaking of the dance, I think, and of Janet\u2019s mourning, which I agree\u000awith you is no reason why she should shut herself up.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m sure I beg your pardon, Gussy,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, wiping her eyes,\u000afor she had not been able to stop her laugh, \u201cbut I\u2019m glad of your\u000asupport.
p13639
aVNo, no, my dear, the mourning has nothing to say to it.
p13640
aVYou\u000ahave worn it very faithfully, and you have done your poor aunt full\u000ajustice.
p13641
aVI\u2019m sure, poor lady, she would be the first to say, could she\u000aknow, that you must now begin to enjoy yourself a little.
p13642
aVAt least, take\u000awhat enjoyment you can: for you know the men are generally in the\u000aminority, and nobody can ever tell till the last moment whether there\u000awill be enough partners or not.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere shall be enough,\u201d said Dolff, with a grand air.
p13643
aV\u201cI should be\u000aashamed of myself if I couldn\u2019t produce a lot of fellows--only you\u2019ll\u000ahave to put some of them up for the night.
p13644
aVCouldn\u2019t you clear out that\u000aold wing?
p13645
aVThere must be some rooms that could be used if they were\u000atidied up.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, with a change of countenance.
p13646
aVShe, too, became\u000aperfectly blank, as Gussy had done, dismissing all expression from her\u000aface.
p13647
aV\u201cIt is quite out of the question to open the wing.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy?\u201d said Dolff.
p13648
aV\u201cI don\u2019t see the difficulty.
p13649
aVA couple of housemaids\u000aand a few brooms----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy boy, I must be the judge on this point,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood.
p13650
aV\u201cThere\u000ais nothing to be done with the wing.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut, mother----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI will have no more said on the subject,\u201d she answered, peremptorily.
p13651
aV\u201cYou had better come and wheel me into my room, I have some business to\u000ado this morning.
p13652
aVAnd, Janet, I hope it\u2019s settled, and that I shall hear\u000ano more about your mourning.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are very kind, Mrs. Harwood.
p13653
aVI am afraid I have no dress----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have a very pretty dress; and let me tell you, my dear--though I\u000adaresay you know it--that black is always becoming, and that you look\u000avery well in that dress.
p13654
aVNow, Dolff----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope we shan\u2019t hear any more on that subject,\u201d said Gussy, with an\u000aair of decision, as her mother\u2019s chair was wheeled away.
p13655
aV\u201cI\u2019m very glad\u000ato humor Dolff, but I shall soon be very tired of it if there are many\u000amore difficulties.
p13656
aVDress is always a nuisance on such occasions.
p13657
aVOne\u000awears a ball dress once--it is as good as new, but when one takes it out\u000ait is old-fashioned, or faded, or something, and it is such a waste of\u000agood money to get another to be worn again only on one occasion.
p13658
aVYou may\u000abe very glad you are in black, Janet--and there is Ju, she is not out,\u000aand won\u2019t be for a couple of years.
p13659
aVAnd yet she can\u2019t be sent to bed.
p13660
aVHow is she to be dressed for this one night?
p13661
aVI know mamma will overdo it\u000aif she is left to herself.
p13662
aVAll that and the supper, and the musicians,\u000aand everything of that kind is left on my hands.
p13663
aVA ball may be very nice\u000aat the moment--for those who like it--but the trouble it gives, both\u000abefore and after!
p13664
aVEvery spare inch of room must, of course, be got ready\u000afor Dolff\u2019s friends.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you think, then, that Mrs. Harwood will yield about the wing?\u201d said\u000aJanet, very curious.
p13665
aV\u201cAs if Vicars would!\u201d cried Julia.
p13666
aV\u201cMamma doesn\u2019t matter--it\u2019s Vicars\u000athat won\u2019t have it.
p13667
aVI\u2019ve always wanted to get into the wing, but Vicars\u000astands sentinel as if he were a jailer.
p13668
aVI\u2019ve told him a dozen times I\u000awas sure he had got something wrong in there.
p13669
aVI can\u2019t bear Vicars!\u201d said\u000aJulia, hurrying out the words to get as much said as possible before\u000aGussy\u2019s imperative tones broke in.
p13670
aV\u201cJu!
p13671
aVyou are unbearable.
p13672
aVI thought at one time there was an improvement,\u000abut there\u2019s none.
p13673
aVVicars is a most valuable servant.
p13674
aVWe have the highest\u000arespect for him and his opinion, both mamma and I.
p13675
aVAt such a time as\u000athis he is more good than words can say--and always so careful for the\u000acredit of the house.
p13676
aVIsn\u2019t it time you had begun lessons?
p13677
aVI must go and\u000asee after the house.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs Janet followed her pupil out of the room she was met in the hall by\u000aDolff, very eager and breathless.
p13678
aV\u201cYou\u2019re coming, Miss Summerhayes?
p13679
aVI must stop you just for a moment to\u000amake sure.
p13680
aVDon\u2019t spoil it altogether by saying you\u2019ll not come.
p13681
aVI shan\u2019t\u000acare a brass farthing for it if you\u2019re not there.
p13682
aVBut you _will_\u000acome--say you will?
p13683
aVYou won\u2019t disappoint us all and ruin it for me----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI can\u2019t see what difference it would make,\u201d said Janet, \u201cespecially if\u000athere are too many ladies already.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut that wouldn\u2019t affect _you_.
p13684
aVYou will always---- Miss Summerhayes,\u000aI\u2019ll throw it all up if you don\u2019t come.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t threaten me, Mr. Harwood; besides, after what your mother so\u000akindly said, I am coming--to look on at least.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, I like that!\u201d cried Dolff.
p13685
aVHe seized her hand and squeezed it as\u000ashe passed him.
p13686
aV\u201cBut you may say anything you like,\u201d he said, rejoicing,\u000a\u201cso long as you come.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJanet,\u201d said Julia, when they had reached the school-room, \u201cI think\u000athis is getting a very queer house.
p13687
aVGussy cares for nothing but Charley\u000aMeredith, and Dolff cares for nothing but you.
p13688
aVIt is--odd--don\u2019t you\u000athink?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt would be if it were true,\u201d said Janet; \u201cbut as it is a mere fancy,\u000ait is not worth discussing.
p13689
aVI hope you are quite ready with your\u000apreparation to-day.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI can\u2019t see,\u201d said Julia, \u201cany signs in you like the other two: but\u000aperhaps it\u2019s just your artfulness.
p13690
aVOne thing, Dolff is much nicer than\u000ahe was before.
p13691
aVAs for Gussy----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are not here to discuss either your brother or your sister, Julia,\u000aand I will not have it.
p13692
aVWhere are your books?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJanet, you have a dreadfully strong will.
p13693
aVMamma says so.
p13694
aVI suppose you\u000anever would give in to another person; to do what they wanted, and not\u000awhat you wanted yourself?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt does not look as if I had a very strong will,\u201d said Janet, with a\u000alaugh, \u201cwhen you run on defying me, instead of getting out your books.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s no answer,\u201d said Julia.
p13695
aV\u201cIf Dolff asked you----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCome,\u201d said Janet, \u201cthis is going too far.
p13696
aVI think the Wars of the\u000aRoses are much more interesting.
p13697
aVYou have never yet made out that table\u000ashowing how Henry the Seventh succeeded; and how it was so wise of him\u000ato marry Elizabeth of York.
p13698
aVCome, you\u2019ll understand it all so much the\u000abetter when you see how it comes----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs if I cared,\u201d said Julia, opening her books with a sigh; \u201cthey were\u000aall cousins, and the one that was strongest took everything, and when\u000athe other one got stronger he took it all back.
p13699
aVI know exactly how it\u000awas; all cousins are like that.
p13700
aVThe very same thing happened with Mary\u000aMorgan, who is my cousin.
p13701
aVAll the toys used to be mine while I had\u000aDolff, and Fred was away; but as soon as Fred came home, who was the\u000abiggest, he seized them all.
p13702
aVI know it far better than any book could\u000asay.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER XXIV.
p13703
aVPerhaps it was Julia\u2019s question; perhaps it was the rapid seizure of her\u000ahand which she had not been able to prevent, which opened that\u000aself-discussion in Janet\u2019s mind.
p13704
aV\u201cIf Dolff asked you----\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d she\u000asaid to herself, \u201cwhat would Dolff ask?\u201d She had been half pleased with\u000ahis homage and her evident power over him in the dearth of other\u000aexcitements--more than half pleased, pleasantly carried on by it with a\u000alaugh at him and his clumsy devotion, which was not unpleasant.
p13705
aVShe\u000athought better of Dolff, on the whole, that he thought so well of her.
p13706
aVIt was the best trait she knew of him.
p13707
aVHer first idea had been that he\u000awas a dolt, that he was a vulgar, music-hall frequenting, loud, and\u000afoolish young man.
p13708
aVBut when she had become aware of his admiration, his\u000asubjugation, the reference to herself that was in everything he did,\u000aJanet could not help entertaining an improved opinion of Dolff.
p13709
aVShe\u000alaughed at him secretly with an amiable and complacent laugh, conscious\u000athat there was a great deal to be said for him.
p13710
aVHe was appreciative--his\u000adoltishness had disappeared--his manners had improved.
p13711
aVJanet was quite\u000aconscious of liking him a great deal better than she had done at first,\u000aand she had no objection to allow him to continue on the same footing as\u000along as he should be at home.
p13712
aVShe had found the quiet evenings, the\u000awarmth and friendliness, and the needlework, pleasant enough when she\u000afirst came to St. John\u2019s Wood, having still all the novelty to amuse and\u000acarry her on, and the story of this new family to pick up and\u000aunderstand.
p13713
aVBut no doubt it soon would have ceased to be exciting had it\u000anot been for the entrance of Meredith upon the scene, with all the\u000aperadventures to which his appearance gave rise and the manner in which\u000ahe had drawn her into the romance by those asides and confidences, which\u000anever were expressed in words, but which she could not help\u000aunderstanding.
p13714
aVAnd then Dolff.
p13715
aVJanet did not feel, as Mrs. Harwood had indiscreetly\u000asaid, that the sight of the pair \u201cphilandering\u201d had brought the water\u000ainto her mouth.
p13716
aVMeredith, with his confidences and the curious doubt she\u000ahad of him, was too interesting for that.
p13717
aVShe did not envy Gussy, nor\u000afeel the least desire to be in the same situation.
p13718
aVWhat sentiment she\u000ahad on the subject was a troubled pity for Gussy; but even that only in\u000athe background; her curiosity and interest and doubt in respect to\u000aMeredith himself being her chief feelings.
p13719
aVAnd Dolff, for a time, had\u000aonly been an interruption to the other study.
p13720
aVBut now it was evident\u000athat matters were getting serious, and that it was necessary for Janet\u000ato take into consideration whither she was going.
p13721
aVThe ball was a great\u000aevent in front of her, which might bring with it serious consequences.
p13722
aVBalls are but frivolous things, but yet they are sometimes fraught with\u000aevents of the deepest importance.
p13723
aVMiss Harwood, as we know, with ideas\u000afar from frivolous, looked forward to this merry-making as perhaps the\u000amost serious moment of her life.
p13724
aVJanet had not the same feeling, but she\u000awas excited and a little disturbed.
p13725
aVIf Dolff should ask her--whatever he\u000amight have to ask: what would happen?
p13726
aVThe reader is aware that Janet at the very outset of her career had been\u000abrought face to face with a similar problem, which she had solved very\u000asummarily without taking much time for thought.
p13727
aVBut the circumstances\u000anow were a little different.
p13728
aVDolff was young (too young, for he was only\u000atwenty-two): there was no disparity in that point of view: and whereas,\u000ain the first instance, the only drawback in refusing was the breaking of\u000apoor Dr. Harding\u2019s heart--a contingency at which Janet was disposed to\u000alaugh in the cruelty of her youth--the matter was complicated now by the\u000apossibility that she would herself suffer by the necessity of giving up\u000aa situation that suited her, where she was comfortable and interested.
p13729
aVThis probability did not please her at all.
p13730
aVTo leave St. John\u2019s Wood,\u000anot to be able to follow the curious romance to its end, not to know how\u000athings arranged themselves between Gussy and Meredith, to be cut sheer\u000aoff from that thread of story which it was so exciting to watch as it\u000atwisted itself out day by day--Janet was very unwilling to contemplate\u000asuch a possibility.
p13731
aVAnd then there came upon her, as if blown upon the fresh winterly breeze\u000awhich puffed in at her open window, the half-forgotten talk of\u000aClover--the conversations that used to go on by the fire at Rose Cottage\u000ain the afternoon, when half-a-dozen ladies would drop in to tea.
p13732
aVHow\u000asevere they were upon a girl who was so fantastic as not to accept a\u000agood offer!
p13733
aVHow they would prophesy that she would never have such\u000aanother--how they would ask indignantly what she expected!
p13734
aVJanet seemed\u000ato hear them all talking together, hoping sarcastically that Mary Brown\u000awould never repent her folly.
p13735
aVDolff would have seemed to these ladies a good match.
p13736
aVA young man who\u000awas at Oxford, who was going in for the Bar, whose mother was so well\u000aoff, and all the money his, though not to be inherited till he was\u000atwenty-five.
p13737
aVWhat was Janet thinking of?
p13738
aVthey would say.
p13739
aVWhat did she\u000aexpect?
p13740
aVHad she another string to her bow that she was so careless of\u000athis?
p13741
aVAnd how could she tell that she would ever have another offer?
p13742
aVShe, a governess, with nothing to fall back upon, and no resource but to\u000ago from one place to another, so long as she pleased her employers or\u000awas wanted.
p13743
aVEven Mrs.
p13744
aVBland, though she was so kind, would say the same\u000athing.
p13745
aVWhat did Janet expect?
p13746
aVShe did not, as will be seen, fling off this new opening of fortune as\u000ashe flung off Dr. Harding.
p13747
aVTo get herself provided for, established in\u000alife all at once, she knew now that this was something.
p13748
aVAnd she\u000areflected with a kind of pride on the triumph of concluding such a\u000amatter at once while the story of Gussy and Meredith still dragged\u000aalong, and in showing _him_ that while he lingered and amused himself\u000aanother made up his mind.
p13749
aVThese ideas fluttered about, now one of them, now another, alighting\u000aupon the surface of her thoughts like snowflakes.
p13750
aVThe opposite arguments\u000adid not come in the same manner, probably because it was the opposite\u000ashe held by, and they stood around her like fortifications round a\u000acitadel.
p13751
aVIt was the others, the temptations, which fluttered about her,\u000aand went and came.
p13752
aV\u201cIf Dolff should ask you----\u201d To marry Dolff!
p13753
aV\u201cOh, never,\u201d cried Janet\u000ato herself; \u201coh, no, no,\u201d with a keen conviction that it was impossible.
p13754
aVAnd then the temptations began to flutter about like snow.
p13755
aVIt was a\u000aserious thing to throw away for no reason--for no particular reason--a\u000agood offer, a good house like this, a good income, and all that is\u000acertain in life.
p13756
aVAnd then, again, on the other hand--Janet lingered in\u000athe garden when Julia ran indoors, saying she would follow instantly.
p13757
aVShe knew that Dolff was safely disposed of--that he could not come to\u000atrouble her, and a moment of solitude was delightful.
p13758
aVShe walked very\u000aquickly under the trees making the round.
p13759
aVTo be, or not to be?
p13760
aVOh, no;\u000ait was not so deep a question as that.
p13761
aVTo marry, or not to marry.
p13762
aVJanet\u000awas well aware throughout that it was a foregone conclusion, and that\u000anothing would really tempt her to marry Dolff: but she let her thoughts\u000aflutter about her, and pretended to discuss the question--not, however,\u000awith much faith in her own thoughts.
p13763
aVIn the second round she extended her promenade a little without\u000athinking, and came accordingly along the side of the wing.
p13764
aVShe looked up\u000aat the window, as was natural, and for the hundredth time asked herself\u000ahow she could have ever fancied that she saw a face between the arching\u000abranches of the ivy.
p13765
aVThe boughs were so strong, the clusters of glossy\u000aleaves so thick, how would any one be seen through?
p13766
aVI need scarcely say\u000athat these arguments did not shake her conviction in the least; and that\u000ashe was as sure of having seen that face as of anything in her\u000aexperience, notwithstanding that she argued so strongly that it was\u000aimpossible.
p13767
aVThe ivy was like an old tree in thickness, great twisted\u000ahairy branches barring the window, the glistening dark leaves concealing\u000aeverything, stopping the light.
p13768
aVHow could a man show through\u000athat?--particularly in moonlight, under a glare so dazzling and\u000aconfusing?
p13769
aVThe whole side of the house looked completely shut up.
p13770
aVThe\u000awindows behind the ivy branches were encrusted with the dirt of years.
p13771
aVThere was no trace of habitation, no possibility of anyone being there.
p13772
aVAnd as for the face at the window, what tricks fancy will play!
p13773
aVIt was\u000avery evident it could be nothing but that.
p13774
aVUnder the wall was a flower border, in which there were some bare\u000arose-bushes, some bulbs showing green points above the ground for spring\u000aflowering, some bushes of wallflowers for the same season, but looking\u000avery shabby after repeated frost.
p13775
aVThere was nothing in this to attract\u000aany one\u2019s attention: but scattered over them, lying on the drooping\u000aleaves of the plants and the damp brown soil, were a quantity of small\u000aspecks of white which caught Janet\u2019s eye.
p13776
aVShe thought at first it might\u000abe the beginning flakes of a snowstorm--for the sky was very gray and\u000alowering.
p13777
aVOn looking up, however, she saw that the atmosphere was still\u000aquite clear, though dull.
p13778
aVLooking again, she saw that several of those\u000awhite specks had lodged on the ivy upon the wall, and went forward to\u000athe flower border with some curiosity to examine what they were.
p13779
aVThere\u000awas no air, the afternoon was perfectly still, so it could scarcely be a\u000awindfall.
p13780
aVTo her great astonishment, Janet found that these were little pieces of\u000apaper, covered with a large indistinct writing, but torn into such small\u000apieces that it was scarcely possible to trace a single word.
p13781
aVShe\u000agathered up a handful of them hastily, looking round to see if any one\u000awas about, with a sense of doing something clandestine, though she could\u000anot tell why.
p13782
aVAnd, indeed, she had scarcely taken a dozen steps in the\u000aopposite direction when she heard other steps coming round the front of\u000athe house, and, looking back, saw Vicars, who seemed to be continually\u000aprowling about, and who, after a glance at the papers on the border,\u000alooked after her with a suspicious start, and finally followed her into\u000athe long walk which ran along one side of the garden.
p13783
aVJanet\u000ainstinctively concealed the bits of paper in her hands, and turned upon\u000ahim before he overtook her.
p13784
aV\u201cDo you want me?
p13785
aVHas Mrs. Harwood sent for me?\u201d she said.
p13786
aV\u201cI can\u2019t say as she has, miss.
p13787
aVSeeing you about, I would just like, if\u000ayou please, to ask you a question.
p13788
aVHave you seen anyone a-picking up\u000apieces of paper about these walks?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSeen anyone--picking up pieces of papers?
p13789
aVNo.
p13790
aVI have not seen\u000aanyone--there has been no one here but myself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh!\u201d said Vicars, drawing a long breath, and then again he looked at\u000aher keenly.
p13791
aV\u201cAs for yourself, miss--you\u2019ve got sharp eyes--maybe you\u2019ve\u000aseen some of them papers blown about the walks.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet persuaded herself afterwards that she did not tell a fib by\u000apremeditation.
p13792
aVShe answered, hastily.
p13793
aV\u201cI have seen nothing about the walks but fallen leaves--there is no wind\u000ato blow anything about.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s true enough,\u201d said Vicars: then he added, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of an old\u000acopybook as someone has been tearing up.
p13794
aVMissus can\u2019t bear a\u000alitter--that\u2019s why I asked you.
p13795
aVBeg your pardon, miss; I hope it\u2019s no\u000aoffence.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you mean to me, I am not in the least offended,\u201d said Janet, with\u000aher most dignified air, and Vicars, though with another searching look\u000aat her, turned away.
p13796
aVShe watched him go back and collect carefully all the scraps in the\u000aborder.
p13797
aVThose she had seemed to burn her fingers with the impatience she\u000afelt to examine them: but in face of Vicars\u2019 suspicious looks she would\u000anot turn back and run in as she wished to do.
p13798
aVShe had to make the whole\u000along round sedately before she could take refuge indoors and in her own\u000aroom.
p13799
aVAnd by that time the afternoon had begun to grow dusk towards\u000aevening.
p13800
aVShe locked her door, and lighted her candle, with an excitement\u000awhich made her temples throb, and then sat down at the table and began\u000aher task to piece the scraps together.
p13801
aVIt was by no means an easy\u000atask--no child\u2019s puzzle was ever so difficult--the bits of paper were\u000avery small, and of the most obstinately disjointed character.
p13802
aVA few of\u000athem, a very few, fitted into each other, and the handwriting was large\u000aand sprawling, one word going over several lines: for the paper was\u000aruled in lines, as if it had been, as Vicars said, a copy-book.
p13803
aVTo\u000asupport this idea further, Janet found, after going over the scraps\u000awhich she had been able to piece together, that the same words were\u000arepeated over and over, and that on several pieces which seemed to have\u000aformed the bottom of the page there were some scrawls that looked like a\u000aname.
p13804
aVShe deciphered, by degrees, \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d and \u201cI want,\u201d and the word\u000a\u201cout,\u201d written in all kinds of letters, sometimes small and sometimes\u000alarge.
p13805
aVThe name at the end gave her still more trouble.
p13806
aVShe made out at last an\u000aAdol, Char--and then there came a piece of paper more triangular than\u000aever, containing the following curious hieroglyphic--\u201cesHar--w--\u201d She\u000apondered over this till the candle burned down and the dressing-bell\u000arang.
p13807
aV\u201cesHar.\u201d What did it mean?
p13808
aVShe dressed hurriedly, with her mind\u000astill full of this problem.
p13809
aVIt only gleamed upon her what it was as she\u000astood, looking in the glass, putting the last touches to her dress.
p13810
aVSometimes, to look at your own face in the glass is like looking into\u000athe face of an intelligent friend, and it sharpens your wits.
p13811
aV\u201cesHar--w.\u201d She spelt it over and over to herself--\u201ce-s-h-a-r--w.\u201d What\u000adid it mean?
p13812
aVAt last Janet threw up her arms over her head and burst into a laugh,\u000athough she was alone--a laugh full of confusion and self-ridicule.
p13813
aVMean!
p13814
aVOf course what it meant was as clear as daylight.
p13815
aVAdol for Adolphus, or\u000aDolff; Char for Charles, with the two last letters joined on to the\u000aHarwood--Adolphus Charles Harwood.
p13816
aVWhat could be more clear?
p13817
aVShe might\u000ahave known that it must be Dolff\u2019s big, straggling hand.
p13818
aVJanet laughed\u000aat herself till she cried, but subdued the sound, lest anyone should\u000ahear, and flung her scraps of paper into a box as if she had been\u000aplaying at a letter game.
p13819
aVOf course, that was what it was--an old\u000acopy-book of Dolff\u2019s inscribed with his name--Adolphus Charles\u000aHarwood--after the usage of the school-room.
p13820
aVHow could she have been\u000asuch a fool?
p13821
aVShe thought of Catherine Morland in \u201cNorthanger Abbey,\u201d and\u000ablushed crimson and hid her face in her hands, though she was alone.
p13822
aVHow\u000aridiculous she had made herself?
p13823
aVOnly, fortunately, nobody knew--not\u000aeven Vicars knew.
p13824
aVThere was not much music downstairs that night, for the time of the ball\u000awas now very near, and everybody was interested in talking it over--the\u000apeople who were coming, and where \u201cDolff\u2019s men\u201d were to be put up, and\u000aall the details.
p13825
aVIt had given the family a great deal of trouble, as\u000aGussy had prophesied it would, and they liked to find a recompense for\u000athese fatigues and anxieties in endless discussions.
p13826
aVJanet found an\u000aopportunity, while they were all busy with the box of programmes which\u000ahad just arrived, of looking at the autograph upon Dolff\u2019s music.
p13827
aVIt\u000awas, to her surprise, not at all like the sprawling hieroglyphics of the\u000acopy-book; but then, to be sure, he must have been a child when he had\u000awritten the others.
p13828
aVThe music was all inscribed \u201cA.
p13829
aVHarwood\u201d in a neat\u000alittle concise hand.
p13830
aVHe saw her looking at it, and came up to her.
p13831
aV\u201cYou are looking at those wretched old things of mine, Miss\u000aSummerhayes?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo; I was only looking at your name on it.
p13832
aVYou don\u2019t use your second\u000aname?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFor a very good reason--I haven\u2019t got one.
p13833
aVIt\u2019s a ridiculous name,\u000aisn\u2019t it?
p13834
aVI sign \u2018D.\u2019 always to my friends.
p13835
aVBut \u2018A.\u2019 is a good enough\u000adisguise.
p13836
aVA great many fellows are Arthur, or Andrew or Alfred, or\u000asomething like a man, so I creep among them.
p13837
aVYou never would suspect a\u000aman of being Adolphus, eh?\u201d cried the young man, \u201cif you saw only A.\u000astanding for his name?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think I should,\u201d said Janet; \u201cbut I thought you were Adolphus\u000aCharles.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe had a little tremor in her voice as she spoke, which was, half alarm\u000aat this betrayal of herself, and half-suppressed laughter, though she\u000adared not laugh.
p13838
aV\u201cOh, no; I have no Charles in my name.
p13839
aVI wish I had.
p13840
aVShouldn\u2019t I use it\u000aif I had the chance!
p13841
aVYou may laugh, Miss Summerhayes, but if you would\u000aonly think how much nicer for a man it would be if his friends called\u000ahim Charley instead of calling him Dolff!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat are you talking of, Dolff?\u201d\u000a\u000aBoth Mrs. Harwood and Gussy had turned round at the sound of the name.
p13842
aV\u201cNot much, mother.
p13843
aVMiss Summerhayes thought I had Charles in my name,\u000aand I tell her I only wish I had.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow did Miss Summerhayes know?\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, with a faint,\u000ascarcely perceptible change of tone.
p13844
aV\u201cI beg your pardon, Janet; but how\u000adid you know--about that name?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow could she know, mother, when it doesn\u2019t exist!
p13845
aVIt was only a\u000amistake she made.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow did you know, Janet, we had that name--in the family?\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Harwood repeated the question with an insistence which was not like\u000aher usual easy-going way.
p13846
aV\u201cI suppose I must have--seen it somewhere,\u201d Janet said, her color\u000arising.
p13847
aVShe felt guilty; she did not know why.
p13848
aVThere was no harm in it.
p13849
aVShe\u000amight have said it was out of an old copybook; but somehow she did\u000anot--scared by she knew not what.
p13850
aVMrs. Harwood had been wheeled, to that end of the room to see the\u000aprogrammes, and to examine some new arrangements Gussy had been making\u000afor the ball.
p13851
aVShe dropped out of her hand the pretty pink programme\u000awhich she had been holding, and called to her son to take her back to\u000aher place, with a change of mien which brought a chill over the party.
p13852
aVJanet felt more and more guilty, though she did not know what she had\u000adone, nor why she could not confess frankly where she had got her\u000ainformation.
p13853
aVThe others soon recovered the momentary depression, and\u000aresumed their talk over the approaching event, but Janet stood at the\u000apiano, running over the notes of a waltz softly with one hand, and\u000awondering why she should have produced, without intending it, so great\u000aan effect.
p13854
aVPresently Mrs. Harwood called her, clapping her hands as she\u000ahad a way of doing to secure attention.
p13855
aVJanet hurried to her side.
p13856
aVThe\u000aold lady had recovered her composure, but she still looked grave.
p13857
aV\u201cMy dear,\u201d she said, \u201cyou will wonder that I was so startled.
p13858
aVThere was\u000ano reason.
p13859
aVOf course you could know nothing.
p13860
aVThat was my husband\u2019s\u000aname.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, Mrs. Harwood, I am so sorry.
p13861
aVI can\u2019t think what made me ask.
p13862
aVIt was\u000abecause most people, I suppose, have more names than one: and Charles\u000awas the first that came into my head.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt will be seen that Janet told a little fib again, but she said it in a\u000ahurry, and did not mean it, or at least this was how she afterwards\u000aexplained it to herself.
p13863
aV\u201cThen it was only what people call a curious coincidence,\u201d said Mrs.\u000aHarwood, with a smile.
p13864
aVCHAPTER XXV.
p13865
aVThe night of the ball arrived at last.
p13866
aVIt was a long time in coming to\u000athe impatience of Dolff and Julia: and even to Gussy, who was not\u000aimpatient, who would rather have held it off a little when the day at\u000alast came, and to whom so many things were involved in the hours which\u000awould be but amusement to the rest.
p13867
aVNobody suspected what was going on\u000aunder Gussy\u2019s tranquil looks.
p13868
aVShe was one of those people whom many\u000athink to be incapable of feeling at all.
p13869
aVShe had a force of resolution\u000anot to expose herself, not to let anybody know what she endured, which\u000awas equal to almost any trial.
p13870
aVThere are many women who possess this\u000apower, but it is most frequently exercised to shield and cover the\u000adelinquencies of others.
p13871
aVGussy\u2019s reticence was only for herself; but\u000astrength of any kind is respectable; and if any one had known the fever\u000athat was in her breast, the chance upon which the fortune of her life\u000aseemed to turn, and the absolute tranquillity with which, to all\u000aappearance, she prepared for the evening\u2019s pleasure, no doubt she would\u000ahave earned the admiration of some and the respect of others.
p13872
aVBut our best qualities, as well as our worst, remain for the most part\u000ablank to those who surround us, and nobody suspected either the trouble\u000ain which Miss Harwood was, or the empire she exercised over her own\u000asoul.
p13873
aVJanet, perhaps, was the only member of the party who was in the\u000aleast degree cognizant of it, but even Janet was chiefly aware, with a\u000afeeling of provoked sympathy, that Gussy, as she generally did, had\u000adressed herself unbecomingly on an occasion on which the little,\u000aquick-witted governess divined she would have wished to look her best.
p13874
aVGussy was not clever in the matter of dress.
p13875
aVShe arrayed herself in the\u000alightest of tints and materials--she who was herself so colorless, who\u000awanted something solid and distinct \u201cto throw her up.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet had done her duty in this respect by the other young woman, who\u000acould scarcely now be called her friend, so conscious were both of a\u000amist that had come between them.
p13876
aVIt was one of Janet\u2019s good qualities\u000athat she had no jealous feeling, but that unfeigned pleasure in dress\u000awhich made her so anxious to see everybody else becomingly attired, that\u000ashe was impatient of failure.
p13877
aVShe had given many hints and suggestions\u000aas to Miss Harwood\u2019s dress on this particular occasion, but they had not\u000abeen attended to.
p13878
aVAnd Gussy had enveloped herself in something that was\u000anot quite white nor yet any other color, with the persistency common to\u000apersons who are without any real instinct in the matter; and, instead of\u000alooking her best, looked more colorless than usual.
p13879
aVJanet could scarcely restrain a cry of impatience when they all met in\u000athe drawing-room, which had been cleared for dancing.
p13880
aVIf Gussy had but\u000aworn her own black gown, what a difference it would have made!
p13881
aVBut Gussy\u000awas altogether unconscious of that, as all the others were unconscious\u000aof the way in which her heart was beating under her _fade_ and foolish\u000adress.
p13882
aVJanet, for her part, had received her programme from Dolff, with his own\u000aneat little \u201cA.
p13883
aVH.\u201d written on a great many lines; but she was too wise\u000ato permit the son of the house to make himself and her remarkable.
p13884
aVJanet\u000ahad a great terror of what the opportunities of the evening might lead\u000ato, very different from that sentiment which moved Gussy.
p13885
aVShe managed to\u000aescape, if not with some other partner, then alone, anywhere, even going\u000aso far as to make a rush upstairs till some of the dances bespoken by\u000aDolff were over.
p13886
aVShe was determined not to lay herself open to any\u000acomments in that respect, or to expose herself to the chances of what\u000aDolff might say in the excitement of the evening.
p13887
aVBut she had no such\u000aterror of Meredith, who, after he had done his duty in various\u000adirections was so polite as to ask the governess for a dance.
p13888
aVNor was\u000ashe alarmed by the eagerness with which he plunged into conversation,\u000aleading her away, when half the dance was over, to a quiet corner.
p13889
aV\u201cI am sure you are tired,\u201d he said; \u201cyou have been dancing all the\u000aevening, and so have I.
p13890
aVCome and let us talk a little.
p13891
aVI never have a\u000achance of half-a-dozen words with you, Miss Summerhayes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat cannot matter much,\u201d said Janet, \u201cfor I don\u2019t suppose we have\u000aanything very particular to say to each other, Mr. Meredith.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou must, of course, speak for yourself; but you cannot for me, and I\u000ahave a hundred things I want to say to you.
p13892
aVWe have never had a good\u000atalk but once, and that was the day I walked with you from the\u000acirculating library, when you were quite afraid to be seen with me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot in the least afraid to be seen with any one,\u201d said Janet; \u201cbut it\u000adid not seem suitable somehow.
p13893
aVAnd as we are talking of that, Mr.\u000aMeredith, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very suitable----\u201d\u000a\u000aHere Janet thought better of what she was going to say, and stopped\u000ashort.
p13894
aV\u201cWhat does not seem suitable?
p13895
aVTell me, I implore you!
p13896
aVHow can I regulate\u000amy conduct according to your wishes, which is my highest ambition, if\u000ayou will not tell me what to do?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have nothing to do with your conduct, Mr. Meredith, I don\u2019t\u000aunderstand why you should wish to sneer at me----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI--sneer!
p13897
aVbut you know you don\u2019t mean that.
p13898
aVI sometimes try to secure\u000ayour sympathy, I allow, when I\u2019m at a particularly hard place.
p13899
aVThey say\u000athat the lookers-on see most of the game, and I soon saw in your eyes,\u000aif you\u2019ll forgive me, that you----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t see any game,\u201d cried Janet, with indignation, \u201cand if you are\u000aplaying one you ought to be ashamed of yourself; and, at all events, I\u000awill not be in your confidence!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHush!\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t be so fiery.
p13900
aVIf you get up and leave me you will\u000amake everybody ask why, and we don\u2019t want to raise any talk, do we?
p13901
aVLook\u000athere, Miss Summerhayes--for I must talk of something--look at that man\u000aVicars.
p13902
aVWhat a hang-dog face he has!
p13903
aVLike a man that is up to some\u000amischief, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t like Vicars,\u201d said Janet, hastily; \u201che would like to be\u000ainsolent, if he dared.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cInsolent, the beast!
p13904
aVYou have only to give Dolff a hint,\u201d said\u000aMeredith, with a laugh, \u201cand he\u2019ll soon put a stop to that.
p13905
aVI should\u000alike, all the same, to know a little what\u2019s Vicars\u2019s mission in this\u000ahouse.
p13906
aVOh, I know he\u2019s an old servant, and all that.
p13907
aVI have my little\u000acuriosities, Miss Summerhayes; haven\u2019t you?
p13908
aVThere are some things I\u000ashould like to know.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI thought you must know everything,\u201d said Janet; \u201cyou are such a very\u000aold friend.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow Janet was bursting with desire to communicate to somebody her own\u000awonderings and the things she had seen, or had imagined herself to see.
p13909
aVShe was held back by many things--by regard for the law which forbids\u000ayou to talk to strangers of things you have observed in the house in\u000awhich you live: and also by a principle of honor, which is but feeble in\u000asuch matters in most bosoms, and by a lingering sense of loyalty\u000atowards Gussy, whose property this man was--and by a general prejudice\u000aagainst making mischief.
p13910
aVBut, on the other hand, she was impelled to\u000aspeak by her own curiosity and conviction that there was something to\u000afind out, and eagerness to communicate her discoveries.
p13911
aVAnd then\u000aMeredith was not a stranger; and if there was anything to find out he\u000ahad a right to know it; and, of course, as Gussy\u2019s husband he would know\u000aeverything.
p13912
aVJanet\u2019s heart began to beat with excitement.
p13913
aVShould she tell\u000ahim?
p13914
aVShe wanted so much to do it that she scarcely knew how to keep in\u000athe words.
p13915
aV\u201cI am an old friend,\u201d said Meredith.
p13916
aV\u201cI have known them all my life;\u000atherefore I have a kind of right, don\u2019t you think, to want to know?
p13917
aVAnd\u000aI am one of the very few men who come familiarly about the house, so if\u000athere was any way in which that fellow Vicars was taking them in, or\u000aplaying upon them, I am just the person who ought to be told, for I\u000acould take steps to put them on their guard.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was on this argument, which seemed so unanswerable, and especially\u000aapplicable if Meredith became, as Janet assured herself was inevitable,\u000athe son of the house, that at last she spoke.
p13918
aVAfter all, it did not seem\u000aas if she had very much to tell.
p13919
aVShe confided to him her suspicions that\u000aVicars had somebody shut up in the wing whom no one knew about, and that\u000ashe herself had seen--she was certain she had seen--a face pressed\u000aagainst the window-panes, visible between the branches of the ivy; and\u000ahow, just below the same window, there had been the other day that\u000alittle shower of scraps of paper, which looked as if they had been\u000athrown out.
p13920
aVMeredith listened with the greatest eagerness.
p13921
aVHe leaned his elbow on\u000ahis knee, and his head in his hand, looking up into her face, and\u000ashielding her thus from observation in her dark corner, so that even\u000aGussy, passing by at a little distance on the arm of her partner, could\u000anot make out who the lady was to whom he was talking, though the sight\u000aincreased almost beyond bearing the agitation in her mind.
p13922
aVMeredith\u2019s\u000aeyes on Janet\u2019s face, so near, and the manner in which he surrounded\u000aher, shutting off the world, confused her and gave her a vague sort of\u000aguilt; but, after all, how could she have helped it?
p13923
aVShe could not have\u000arefused to dance with him.
p13924
aVShe could not refuse to sit down to talk, to\u000asit out the Lancers which was then being played, and which Gussy was\u000agoing in dutifully with her partner to dance.
p13925
aVAny other girl whom he had\u000aasked would have done that, and how could Janet refuse?
p13926
aVBut there was no\u000adoubt that she felt a pang as Gussy, in her pale dress which did not\u000abecome her, and with a look in her eyes dimly divined by this little\u000ainterloper, passed into the bright room beyond to perform her duty\u000adance.
p13927
aVJanet went on with her revelations after this episode.
p13928
aVShe had seen\u000aVicars crossing the hall with a heavy tray covered with dainties very\u000alate one night, after everybody was in bed.
p13929
aVShe had seen the door in the\u000ahall, which was said to lead to the wing which was believed to be\u000apermanently shut up, open to him----\u000a\u000aAt these words Meredith started up.
p13930
aVThey were quite alone in their\u000acorner--nobody was about.
p13931
aVThe dance was going on gayly--the ball-room\u000acrowded, a little hedge of men standing round the door.
p13932
aV\u201cEverything is quiet,\u201d he said, hastily; \u201clet us go and see.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGo and see--what?\u201d\u000a\u000aHe drew her arm within his, with a smile upon her, which dazzled Janet\u000aand made her cast down her eyes.
p13933
aVShe was so startled that she was\u000ascarcely aware that he kept her hand in his as he led her along.
p13934
aV\u201cWe have five minutes,\u201d he said, \u201cand there is nobody here.
p13935
aVLet\u2019s go and\u000asee.\u201d It seemed half a schoolboy frolic, half a righteous mission.
p13936
aVHe\u000ahurried her into the hall, which was deserted, enveloping her so in his\u000ashadow that Janet felt as if she had no longer any will of her own.
p13937
aV\u201cWhich is it?\u201d he asked, bending over her so that she felt his breath on\u000aher neck.
p13938
aVThey spoke in whispers, and crowded together on their clandestine\u000aenterprise so that they seemed but one figure.
p13939
aVShe put out her hand,\u000atrembling, and touched the door.
p13940
aVJanet\u2019s heart had been beating loudly before.
p13941
aVIt jumped up now as if it\u000awould choke her when she felt the door move slightly under her hand.
p13942
aVWhen Meredith added quickly the pressure of his fingers it swung open.
p13943
aVHe drew her in, scarcely conscious of what he was doing.
p13944
aV\u201cOh-h!\u201d Janet\u000abreathed a low cry of excitement upon his shoulder.
p13945
aVWhatever the\u000adiscovery might be there was now no escape.
p13946
aVHe silenced her, pressing\u000aher against him.
p13947
aVThey were in a dark, narrow passage, which ended in\u000athick curtains closely drawn, and was lighted by the feeblest spark of\u000alight.
p13948
aV\u201cWe must follow it on now,\u201d he said, in her ear.
p13949
aV\u201cNot a word--not a\u000aword.\u201d\u000a\u000aInside the curtains was a door which opened outward, and admitted to a\u000asteep, straight staircase.
p13950
aVEverything was dark, muffled, breathless.
p13951
aVThey groped their way up this, and found before them another closed door\u000aat the top, which yielded also to pressure, moving noiselessly.
p13952
aVWithin\u000athis were curtains again, in which they both stumbled, unable at first\u000ato open or put them aside.
p13953
aVBut the circumstances were desperate, and\u000asomehow they made their way through.
p13954
aVThey found themselves then in a\u000aroom lighted only by the window, which was the very window, covered with\u000aivy, at which Janet had seen that old man\u2019s face.
p13955
aVBut the room was void\u000aand dark.
p13956
aVThey stood for a moment looking round, but, though they could\u000asee next to nothing, it was certain there was nobody there.
p13957
aVBy this time Meredith\u2019s excitement had so grown that he forgot Janet.
p13958
aVAt\u000aleast he dropped her arm involuntarily, and leaving her trembling,\u000ascarcely able to support herself, made a long step forward to where his\u000akeen eye had found out a crevice, through which came a faint ray of\u000alight.
p13959
aVOnce more he held back a curtain and pushed a door; then with a\u000asudden, quick movement, held out his hand to Janet.
p13960
aVHer eyes by this\u000atime had become accustomed to the gloom, and she perceived that he\u000acalled her.
p13961
aVHe caught her in his arm as she stole forward, and placed\u000aher before him.
p13962
aVTheir breaths came quick in the same suppressed cadence.
p13963
aVBoth were far too much excited for speech, even had they dared to speak.
p13964
aVThis was what Janet saw.
p13965
aVA room comfortably furnished, largely\u000acurtained, dark, heavy stuff, so far as she could see in her\u000ainstantaneous glance, covering the walls, a fire burning cheerfully, a\u000asmall, shaded light by the side of a large sofa, on which lay a man fast\u000aasleep--so fast asleep that the very air seemed slumbering over him.
p13966
aVShe\u000afell back upon her companion with what, had she dared to utter it, would\u000ahave been a cry.
p13967
aVThe pale old face, long and tragical, the crown of\u000awhite hair, the long white beard, half hid by the great red coverlet\u000awhich enveloped him, were the same which she had seen at the window.
p13968
aVIt\u000awas, then, no fancy, no trick of reflection.
p13969
aVJanet for a moment, in her\u000aagitation, was unconscious of all the circumstances round her.
p13970
aVShe\u000agasped dumbly, paralyzed, yet thrilling with wonder, terror, and dismay.
p13971
aVMeredith\u2019s face touched hers as he whispered \u201cCome away.\u201d He almost\u000acarried her through the anteroom, the dark staircase, the\u000afaintly-lighted passage, lingering at the door for a moment to see that\u000aall was quiet.
p13972
aVThey came out into the hall, anxious but safe.
p13973
aVThe crowd\u000awas still about the door of the dancing-room, but the music bore witness\u000athat the dance was just at its conclusion.
p13974
aVMeredith hurried Janet back\u000ato the sheltered corner which they had left for this quest.
p13975
aV\u201cOne moment; I must speak to you for one moment more,\u201d he whispered\u000abehind a bush of evergreens, which concealed them entirely.
p13976
aV\u201cYou don\u2019t\u000aknow how important this is--Janet, have you got those papers----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe copy-book?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t believe it was a copy-book.
p13977
aVTry to give them to me quietly the\u000anext time I am here, or send them--that would be the safest--United\u000aUniversities Club.
p13978
aVDearest, I can\u2019t say half I want to say to you\u000ato-night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo me there is nothing to say,\u201d said Janet, drawing away from him.
p13979
aV\u201cI\u000ahave forgotten myself in the excitement--but don\u2019t think, Mr.\u000aMeredith----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, I will think,\u201d he said.
p13980
aV\u201cDon\u2019t warn me off, for you can\u2019t do it.
p13981
aVI\u000ahave thought of you since the first moment I saw you.
p13982
aVIs it my fault if\u000athey take things into their heads, Janet?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI will not have you call me Janet,\u201d she said, with angry vehemence.
p13983
aV\u201cBut I must.
p13984
aVI never call you anything else--to myself--darling!
p13985
aVWe\u2019ll\u000ameet again before long, and be able to say everything to each other.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe let her go suddenly, and in a moment had joined the crowd of the\u000alookers-on, who had been awaiting the end of the Lancers, and now were\u000ascattering to permit the exit of the more dutiful couples who had been\u000aperforming that now somewhat despised dance.
p13986
aVJanet seized the opportunity to fly upstairs to the shelter of her own\u000aroom, which she reached breathless and agitated.
p13987
aVShe could scarcely\u000arealize what had passed in this strange evening so full of excitement.
p13988
aVMeredith\u2019s presumption--was it presumption?
p13989
aVhis unpardonable freedom of\u000aspeech--but was it unpardonable?
p13990
aVthe confidences into which he had\u000ahurried her; the extraordinary discovery they had made together; the way\u000ain which he had assumed her consent and acquiescence, taking possession\u000aof her as if she belonged to him.
p13991
aVJanet tried to be angry; she said to\u000aherself that it was detestable, unpardonable; that never more would she\u000aspeak to him again; that, if _that_ were true, then his behavior to\u000aGussy was villainous; and if it were false?
p13992
aVHer breath came hard; her\u000aveins swelled as if they would burst.
p13993
aVHow dared he speak to her--look at\u000aher--hold her so?
p13994
aVJanet saw herself in her glass, with eyes blazing,\u000alips quivering, nostrils dilating, and wondered at herself.
p13995
aVShe could\u000asee that she had never looked like that before--never so brilliant, so\u000amuch excited, or taken out of herself.
p13996
aVOh!
p13997
aVhow did he dare--he who was\u000aas good as engaged to Gussy Harwood?
p13998
aVIt was _that_ she thought of--not\u000aof the mysterious secret tenant of the wing.
p13999
aVThat strange habitation\u000awith its tenant had died out of her mind.
p14000
aVShe found herself thinking\u000aonly of Charley--of whom?
p14001
aVGood heavens!
p14002
aVwhat had she to do with his\u000aname--of Mr. Meredith and his impertinence and presumption.
p14003
aVHe had told\u000aher to tell Dolff (with a laugh) of Vicars\u2019 impertinence; but what was\u000athat of Vicars to his?
p14004
aVHe had taken possession of her against her will.
p14005
aVHe had made her a traitor to the people whose bread she was eating.
p14006
aVHe\u000ahad made her the instrument of humiliation to Gussy.
p14007
aVOh!
p14008
aVwould he go now\u000aand whisper to Gussy, and laugh with her at Dolff and the governess?
p14009
aVJanet clinched her hands and bit her lip till it almost bled.
p14010
aVWas this\u000awhat he would do?
p14011
aVTell Gussy perhaps that the governess was a silly\u000alittle thing, and believed everything that was said to her--or was it\u000aGussy that he would slight and scorn, after so long holding her in\u000asuspense?
p14012
aVJanet felt that she abhorred Charley.
p14013
aVOh!
p14014
aVto think that his\u000aname should come to her lips without any intention, when she had nothing\u000ato do with it!
p14015
aVand he had called her by hers--the insolent, the\u000ascoundrel, the deceiver!
p14016
aVJanet wrought herself up into a passion, and\u000araved at him within herself like a little fury: and then she suddenly\u000achanged her mood, and fell a-crying, soaking up the tears that would\u000acome with her handkerchief lest they should make her eyes red, and\u000asaying to herself \u201cPoor Charley!\u201d from the bottom of her heart.
p14017
aVCHAPTER XXVI.
p14018
aVMeanwhile, all was going on merrily below, dance succeeding dance.
p14019
aVThe\u000amusic was good, the floor was good.
p14020
aV\u201cDolff\u2019s men\u201d had fully made up the\u000anumber of partners necessary, and left a few over to support the doorway\u000alest it should fall.
p14021
aVDolff himself, in the midst of the gay crowd which\u000ahad been collected to give him pleasure, wandered about distractedly,\u000aseeking Janet, but unable to find her, and teasing Gussy, who had\u000acertainly enough to worry her without his constant questions, by demands\u000awhere Janet was.
p14022
aVGussy had plenty of her own affairs on hand.
p14023
aVThe hours were\u000apassing--those hours which she had felt to be so full of fate--and\u000anothing was happening; and her heart was sore with unfulfilled\u000aexpectations.
p14024
aVTo think that while her mind was thus torn asunder, while\u000ashe was almost unconsciously, but with the keenest anxiety, watching for\u000aone figure in the crowd, yet carrying on the necessary conversations,\u000alistening to what ever nonsense might be said to her, laughing at the\u000asmallest jokes, presenting generally the aspect to all around her of a\u000adisengaged and cheerful spirit, while suffering an endless torture of\u000asuspense--to think that then Dolff should assail her with his questions:\u000a\u000a\u201cWhere is Miss Summerhayes?
p14025
aVHave you seen Miss Summerhayes?
p14026
aVThis is our\u000adance.
p14027
aVWhere has she disappeared to?
p14028
aVWhat has become of her?
p14029
aVGussy, have\u000ayou seen Miss Summerhayes?\u201d\u000a\u000aGussy tried to push off her brother\u2019s inquiries with trifling answers,\u000abut finally found that this last straw of provocation was more than she\u000acould bear.
p14030
aV\u201cI am not Janet\u2019s keeper,\u201d she said, with angry impatience.
p14031
aV\u201cYou had\u000abetter attend to your guests, Dolff, and let Miss Summerhayes look after\u000aherself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBy Jove!\u201d said Dolff, who was almost as exasperated as she, \u201cI knew you\u000awere selfish, Gussy, but never so bad as that.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey glared at each other for a moment, both at the end of their\u000apatience, distracted, abandoned, left to themselves.
p14032
aVIt was a kind of\u000arelief thus to snarl at each other, to let out their offence and\u000atrouble, persuading themselves each that the intolerableness of the\u000aother was the cause.
p14033
aVBut Gussy\u2019s case was by far the harder of the two.
p14034
aVJanet had given Dolff no right to resent her absence--but the other--the\u000aother!
p14035
aVIt did poor Gussy good for a moment to be able to be angry with\u000aDolff.
p14036
aVWhen Meredith came to her for the third dance she had given him, the two\u000afirst of which he had danced conscientiously all through without a word\u000athat could not be breathed in the course of the twistings and whirling,\u000aGussy declared she was too tired to dance any more.
p14037
aV\u201cThen let us sit it out together,\u201d he said; \u201cthere is a nice corner I\u000aknow where we may be as private as if we were all alone, yet see\u000aeverybody--if you wish to see everybody.
p14038
aVI think it must have been\u000aarranged expressly for you and me there are two such comfortable\u000achairs.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have put that corner to use before,\u201d said Gussy.
p14039
aV\u201cSeveral times,\u201d he answered, promptly; \u201cone must do something with\u000aone\u2019s partner if, for example, she doesn\u2019t dance well, or there is any\u000aother drawback.
p14040
aVI have been conducting myself more or less like the son\u000aof the house to-night.
p14041
aVYou may think me presumptuous to say so, but I\u000athink, after Dolff, I have almost the best right to look after your\u000aguests, Gussy, and see that it goes off well.
p14042
aVDo you allow my claim?\u201d\u000a\u000aIn that dark corner which he had occupied a little before with Janet it\u000awas not possible to see the warm blush, like a fresh tide of life, which\u000acame over Gussy\u2019s face; but something of that warm, sweet flood of\u000aconsciousness could be made out in the melting of her voice.
p14043
aV\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said, with a happy tremor, \u201cyou have known us longer than\u000aany one here--almost all your life.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAll our lives,\u201d said Meredith, with a little emphasis on the pronoun.
p14044
aV\u201cI can\u2019t remember the time when we didn\u2019t know each other, can you,\u000aGussy?
p14045
aVThere is nothing else can come so near as that.
p14046
aVAnd I have been\u000ataking it upon me to entertain your guests as if they were my own.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThank you very much for that, Charley.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh no, you need not thank me.
p14047
aVYou will do as much or more for me when\u000athe time comes--when I shall have guests of my own.
p14048
aVBut I am not well\u000aenough off to think of that yet.
p14049
aVA little patience and then my turn will\u000acome.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI thought,\u201d said Gussy, \u201cyou were telling mamma the other night----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, that I have made a beginning.
p14050
aVYes, I have made a beginning; and you\u000amay be sure it will not be my fault if it does not go on: a year\u000aperhaps, or so, and I shall feel that I am justified--ah, Gussy, I wish\u000athat time was come.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou must not insist on too much,\u201d said Gussy, softly; \u201cto begin is the\u000agreat matter.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSo it is; but I must have the means to get a nice house and everything\u000asuitable before---- When it comes to having guests, you know, there must\u000abe something to give them, and--better things even than that.
p14051
aVAh, me!
p14052
aVwaiting is slow work.\u201d Gussy echoed the sigh from the bottom of her\u000aheart.
p14053
aV\u201cBut I hope there\u2019s a good time coming,\u201d continued Meredith, with\u000aa smile, putting his hand upon Gussy\u2019s, and giving it a warm pressure.
p14054
aVHe looked many things which he did not say, and poor Gussy sat in a sort\u000aof trance of mortified happiness, feeling herself put back, checked, as\u000aif it were she who was over-eager and impatient, yet so assured of his\u000atenderness, so moved by the high-mindedness of his determination to have\u000aeverything worthy of her before he should ask her to share his fate,\u000athat her heart melted within her in answering tenderness and consent.
p14055
aVNo, she would never, could never doubt him more.
p14056
aVHis hand laid upon her\u000ahand was not enough for the response she was so ready to give: but he\u000aknew and trusted her, as she felt she ought always to have known and\u000atrusted him.
p14057
aVAnd there was a moment\u2019s silence, to Gussy more eloquent\u000athan any words; a sort of noiseless betrothal, binding them to each\u000aother till the time for full disclosure and explanation should come.
p14058
aVHe\u000astooped down at last and kissed her hand as if his feelings were getting\u000atoo much for him, and then broke into remarks upon the dancers, who were\u000aonce more streaming out into the cooler space at the end of the waltz.
p14059
aVHe called her attention to two or three, and made her laugh.
p14060
aVShe felt no\u000alonger any difficulty in being amused.
p14061
aV\u201cBut I am afraid I must go soon,\u201d she said; \u201cI am engaged for the next\u000adance.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSit close,\u201d said Meredith, \u201cand the man will never find you.
p14062
aVDolff\u2019s\u000amen are all as blind as bats.
p14063
aVThey know nobody, and they go prowling\u000around trying to recognize some girl they have only seen for a moment.
p14064
aVThere is one who has begun his round already, peering at everybody.
p14065
aVI\u000ahope he is not your man?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPerhaps he is,\u201d said Gussy, drawing further back; \u201cI don\u2019t know him any\u000amore than he knows me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen you had far better stop with one who does know you, and--something\u000amore,\u201d said Meredith.
p14066
aV\u201cThere!
p14067
aVhe has passed and you are safe.
p14068
aVAh, so\u000ahere is old Vicars again!
p14069
aVWhere does he always appear from, whenever you\u000awant him, that old man?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe appears--from where he lives, Charley.
p14070
aVYou know mamma lets him have\u000athe coachman\u2019s room in the wing.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat wing has always seemed a most mysterious place to me.
p14071
aVHow do you\u000aget into it?
p14072
aVDo you strike upon a trap-door, and does he start up\u000athrough it like a jack-in-the-box?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNonsense,\u201d said Gussy.
p14073
aV\u201cThere is a door at the back, as I am sure you\u000amust have seen.\u201d\u000a\u000aHer tone was quite simple and unembarrassed, and Meredith for a moment\u000awas silent.
p14074
aVHe went on again, however, immediately.
p14075
aV\u201cThere must be some nice rooms up there.
p14076
aVI can\u2019t think why you never use\u000athem.
p14077
aVAlmost enough for a young _mnage_.
p14078
aVFor Dolff and his wife, for\u000ainstance, if he was to make a match with Miss Summerhayes, or even----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCharley, I wish you would not always make fun of those two.
p14079
aVThere is no\u000achance whatever of Dolff making a match with Miss Summerhayes.
p14080
aVMy mother\u000awould be furious; and it is really unkind to Janet, who, I am sure, has\u000anot the least idea----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, my dear Gussy, well, I\u2019ll say nothing more; but if Dolff is the\u000aperson that has the idea, so much the safer is it to come about.
p14081
aVYou\u000aknow your mother never denied him anything.
p14082
aVAnd the wing looks as if it\u000acould put up a pair of people famously.
p14083
aVIt is a great pity to leave it\u000awithout use.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMamma does make some use of it,\u201d said Gussy; \u201cbut,\u201d she added, after a\u000apause, \u201cthere is not so much room as you think.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI know what use I should put it to if it were mine.
p14084
aVI suppose Mrs.\u000aHarwood keeps the lumber in it.
p14085
aVI should clear away all that ivy, and\u000aopen the windows, and turn out the rubbish, and then---- Ah, well, I\u000amust put away all these dreams for the next year.\u201d\u000a\u000aGussy sat with one hand still in his, with her heart full of happiness,\u000ayet conscious of something wanting.
p14086
aVShe was melted beyond expression by\u000ahis tone, and by all that he said or inferred but did not say.
p14087
aVShe was\u000anot even aware at the moment of what it was that was wanting.
p14088
aVThe ache\u000awas calmed.
p14089
aVShe was subdued and charmed away into an enchanted land.
p14090
aVTo\u000ahave less than perfect faith in him would have been an offence against\u000aevery tradition of her heart, and yet----\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Dolff was rushing everywhere, winding his way among all the\u000agroups, seeking Janet.
p14091
aV\u201cMother, have you seen Miss Summerhayes?
p14092
aVWhere is Miss Summerhayes?
p14093
aVThe\u000anext is our dance\u201d (it was the second or third which he had thus\u000adescribed), \u201cand I can\u2019t find her anywhere.
p14094
aVJu, where is Miss\u000aSummerhayes?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe must have run up to her room.
p14095
aVPerhaps she tore her dress.
p14096
aVPerhaps\u000ashe is mending up somebody else\u2019s gown.
p14097
aVPerhaps she was tired.\u201d\u000a\u000aThese were the explanations that were rained upon him, till Dolff became\u000adesperate.
p14098
aVHe seized Julia by the arm, and conducted her perforce to the\u000afoot of the stairs.
p14099
aVJulia was enjoying herself very much, dancing every\u000adance, and determining in her own mind that no force should get her to\u000abed before everything was over.
p14100
aVShe was very indignant, and struggled as\u000aDolff rushed her through the room without the least regard for her\u000aopinion.
p14101
aV\u201cGo and fetch Miss Summerhayes.
p14102
aVTell her it\u2019s our dance, and I\u2019m\u000awaiting.
p14103
aVGo and fetch Miss Summerhayes, Ju.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut it\u2019s my dance as well as yours,\u201d said Julia.
p14104
aV\u201cI\u2019m going to dance\u000awith one of your men--the man with the red hair.
p14105
aVOh, it\u2019s a shame!
p14106
aVIf\u000aJanet went away it must have been because she was tired.
p14107
aVI won\u2019t go!
p14108
aVOh!
p14109
aVI won\u2019t go!\u201d\u000a\u000aBut there were some points on which Julia was constrained to yield.
p14110
aVDolff was very good-natured, but there were moments when nothing was to\u000abe done with him.
p14111
aVShe was finally compelled to obey, and flew like an\u000aarrow from the bow upstairs and to the locked door of Janet\u2019s room,\u000aagainst which she threw herself in her impatience.
p14112
aV\u201cJanet, you\u2019re to come directly,\u201d cried Julia.
p14113
aV\u201cDolff says it\u2019s his\u000adance.
p14114
aVYou\u2019re to come directly, or else I shall lose mine, for I daren\u2019t\u000ago back without you, and my partner will get some one else.
p14115
aVJanet,\u000aJanet, come away!\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter a minute the door opened, and Janet came out.
p14116
aVShe was wiping away\u000athe tears from her eyelashes, but, notwithstanding these tears, she\u000alooked so resplendent that Julia was dazzled.
p14117
aV\u201cWhat have you been doing to yourself?
p14118
aVCrying generally makes one\u2019s nose\u000ared, but you look as if you were all made of diamonds,\u201d said the girl.
p14119
aV\u201cCome along, come along.
p14120
aVI shall lose my dance, and it will be all\u000abecause of you.\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff was standing impatient at the foot of the stairs.
p14121
aV\u201cOh, here you are at last, Miss Summerhayes,\u201d he cried.
p14122
aVHe held out his\u000aarm for her hand, and led her away hurriedly.
p14123
aV\u201cYou have almost spoilt my\u000anight for me,\u201d he cried; \u201cwhere have you been?
p14124
aVI did not get up a dance,\u000aand rummage up men, and all that, for you to hide yourself upstairs.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut I did not want you either to give a dance or to rummage up men,\u201d\u000asaid Janet, with a laugh.
p14125
aV\u201cI know you don\u2019t care,\u201d he said.
p14126
aV\u201cIt is nothing to you that it\u2019s all as\u000adull as ditch water to me when you are away: and now we must dance when\u000aI wanted to talk.
p14127
aVI have a hundred thousand things to say, and I quite\u000acalculated upon to-night for that: for I can\u2019t talk to you at all most\u000adays.
p14128
aVLet\u2019s dance and get it over, and then we can go away somewhere and\u000atalk.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Janet did not want to be talked to by Dolff.
p14129
aVShe would not let him\u000aoff a single round, but danced till the very last bar.
p14130
aVAnd poor Dolff\u000agot out of breath easily, and could not talk while he was dancing.
p14131
aVHe\u000adid not dance very well.
p14132
aVHe was not very fond of it, he allowed, on\u000aordinary occasions, and he was most anxious to break off now.
p14133
aVWhen at\u000alast the waltz was over, he hurried her off to find a corner\u000asomewhere--one of those which he had himself arranged so carefully for\u000athe accommodation of stray pairs of wanderers, and in which he had\u000aimagined himself pouring out his heart to Janet.
p14134
aVBut, to his wrath and\u000adismay, Dolff found that every one was filled.
p14135
aVHe made a hurried round,\u000aholding Janet\u2019s hand tightly within his arm, to keep her from slipping\u000aaway.
p14136
aVBut wherever Dolff had placed a couple of chairs consecrated to\u000ahimself and the lady of his affections there were a frivolous pair\u000aestablished before him--the gentleman lolling with his legs crossed,\u000athe lady sitting prim beside him--the most uninteresting, the most\u000aprosaic of couples.
p14137
aVDolff set his teeth when he came to the end and\u000afound no place.
p14138
aV\u201cWill you come and have some tea?\u201d he said, dolefully, \u201cor an ice, or\u000asomething?
p14139
aVAs every nook is filled, it must be quiet there.
p14140
aVOh, Miss\u000aSummerhayes, this is not what I hoped: I have been looking forward to it\u000aso long, and there is not a spot where you can sit down.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cReally.
p14141
aVI don\u2019t want at all to sit down,\u201d said Janet; \u201clet us walk\u000aabout.
p14142
aVWe can talk just as well as if we were sitting down.
p14143
aVAnd I am not\u000atired.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, it is not all the same,\u201d said Dolff.
p14144
aV\u201cWe can talk, I suppose; but\u000anot about what I wanted, Miss Summerhayes--about the ladies in white and\u000athe ladies in blue, perhaps, and who is flirting and who is not, and the\u000aman with the red hair, and all that.
p14145
aVThat is what ladies talk about\u000abetween the dances; but that\u2019s not my style, Miss Summerhayes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIs it not?\u201d said Janet, \u201cit seems very innocent talk.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cInnocent enough--meaning nothing,\u201d said Dolff, with scorn; \u201clike what\u000awe talk about in the evenings, when we\u2019re all together, and you scarcely\u000asay anything at all.
p14146
aVI hoped we might have had a little real\u000aconversation to-night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am very sorry,\u201d said Janet.
p14147
aV\u201cI fear it was my fault, but I forgot.
p14148
aVI\u000aam very fond of dancing.
p14149
aVWho is that lady that looked at you so\u000asignificantly, Mr. Harwood?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh,\u201d said Dolff, with a groan, \u201cI am booked to her for the next dance.
p14150
aVAnd there are those infernal fellows--I beg your pardon, Miss\u000aSummerhayes--beginning to tune up!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER XXVII.
p14151
aVCharley Meredith walked home from St. John\u2019s Wood to his chambers, which\u000awere in one of the streets about Berkeley Square, between two and three\u000ao\u2019clock in the morning.
p14152
aVIt was in the week between Christmas and the New\u000aYear, when the fashionable parts of London were very quiet, but the\u000aother parts--the domestic quarters, so to speak, where people live all\u000athe year round--more lively than usual.
p14153
aVYet it is needless to say that\u000ahe had on the whole a quiet walk; and it was a long one--a capital\u000aopportunity for thinking, which is an exercise that often goes on best\u000awhen it is accompanied by physical movement, and the sensation of the\u000afresh air in one\u2019s face.
p14154
aVMeredith had spent an exciting night.
p14155
aVHad it been nothing but the two\u000ainterviews above recorded, he would not have been without something to\u000athink of, and the consideration of the fertile crop of embarrassments\u000aand conflicting questions which no doubt would spring from them might\u000ahave occupied him not unprofitably for an hour or two.
p14156
aVHe had gone\u000afurther in one way than he had ever done before, having deliberately\u000adeceived Gussy and given her to understand that within a definite period\u000ahe would present himself as an avowed suitor for--nay, claimant of her\u000ahand.
p14157
aVIn the passing thought he gave to this subject he said to himself\u000athat it was silly to have indicated a definite time.
p14158
aVYet, as nobody\u000acould prophesy what a year might bring forth, there was perhaps but\u000alittle harm, and a hundred things might happen in the meantime to blow\u000aall that nonsense away.
p14159
aVAnd he had also committed himself in respect to\u000aJanet, for whom he felt a real inclination as much resembling love as\u000aanything he knew of.
p14160
aVYes, if circumstances permitted, if it should turn\u000aout to be anything but the last folly to a man in his position, he felt\u000athat he should like to carry off that little girl, to marry her, and pet\u000aher, and be amused by her quick understanding and her piquant looks.
p14161
aVShe\u000awas not too rigid about duty and so forth, though she took upon her that\u000alittle schoolmistress\u2019s manner and reproved him for his levity.
p14162
aVIt was perhaps not quite the most appropriate thing she could have done\u000ato betray the secrets of the house, and help him to the means of\u000asatisfying a long-smouldering curiosity; but it was very clever of her\u000ato find out, and, very engaging as well as serviceable to choose him for\u000athe confidant of her discoveries.
p14163
aVPoor little thing!
p14164
aVHe felt that\u000ahenceforward his attentions to Gussy, which it would now less than ever\u000asuit him to break off, would plant thorns in the bosom of the governess,\u000awhich was a pity, for she was a nice little thing, far more tempting\u000athan---- But these thoughts were all disposed of before Mr. Charles\u000aMeredith got to the end of the street; or at least before he got to the\u000aboundaries of St. John\u2019s Wood: and a much more important matter filled\u000athe foreground of his thoughts.
p14165
aVTo enter into a history of the Harwood family at this period of our\u000astory would be too great a tax upon the reader, and it may be enough to\u000asay that this most respectable family had not been altogether so\u000aspotless as was supposed by the respectable inhabitants of St. John\u2019s\u000aWood.
p14166
aVThere was a break in the tradition, and that a very recent and\u000aimportant one.
p14167
aVThe husband of Mrs. Harwood and father of her children\u000ahad been one of those bold speculators who often ruin whole\u000acommunities.
p14168
aVWhen a number of bubbles burst which he had been\u000ainstrumental in blowing about the world it had been necessary for Mr.\u000aAdolphus Harwood to disappear; and he had done so, leaving but one\u000afeeling of pity for his wife and young children, and for his father--an\u000aold man, who was said to be bowed down to the dust by his son\u2019s\u000ainiquities.
p14169
aVAfter a while, though the interval was one of several years, information\u000awas received that he had died in Spain, and imperceptibly things mended\u000afor the family.
p14170
aVHis father being dead, Dolff became without any trouble\u000athe legitimate heir of the little entailed property upon which his\u000agrandfather lived, and the money matters of the house in general were\u000acleared up, though I cannot explain how, having small knowledge of such\u000asubjects.
p14171
aVIt was found that Mrs. Harwood was not so badly off as had\u000abeen supposed.
p14172
aVShe had some money of her own, which it was said formed\u000athe greater part of her living, and there were other resources of which\u000anobody knew any particulars except, it is to be hoped, her man of\u000abusiness.
p14173
aVShe had at once rejected any quixotic notion of giving up what\u000ashe had for herself and her children to satisfy the creditors of her\u000ahusband.
p14174
aVIt would not have been enough to give them a pittance all\u000around, and in the meantime she and her son and the girls would be added\u000ato the army of the destitute without doing anybody good.
p14175
aVSome people\u000athink differently on such matters, but Mrs. Harwood had never wavered in\u000aher determination, and in general her conduct was at least not\u000adisapproved by her friends, who thought her an excellent woman of\u000abusiness and as full of integrity and steadiness as her husband had been\u000athe reverse.
p14176
aVThese things had happened when the children were very young, and they\u000awere now forgotten, save in the tenacious memories of a few who had\u000asuffered through the failure of Mr. Adolphus Harwood, and who did not\u000afail to bear a certain grudge against his family.
p14177
aVIt had all taken place\u000aat a distance, in Liverpool, where his business was, and where failures\u000aand ruin are commonplace matters such as occur every day; and their home\u000awhere old Mr. Harwood lived was in North Wales, far away from any\u000acommunication with St. John\u2019s Wood.
p14178
aVMrs. Harwood had never lived in that house, which had been let from the\u000aperiod of her father-in-law\u2019s death, and was not known much in the\u000aneighborhood.
p14179
aVShe had been nearly fifteen years in St. John\u2019s Wood,\u000awhere she had soon become known as a liberal supporter of the parish\u000acharities and an acquisition to the neighborhood in every sense of the\u000aword; and where nobody inquired into the family history of an agreeable\u000awidow, very well off, and with nice children.
p14180
aVNow the description of the\u000ahousehold was changed--nice young people with an agreeable mother was\u000ahow they now presented themselves to the knowledge of the world; and any\u000alittle episodes that had happened in Liverpool or in the wilds of North\u000aWales were totally unknown.
p14181
aVMeredith, however, was an exception to this ignorance.
p14182
aVHe was a\u000aWelshman.
p14183
aVHe had known them all his life, and he knew everything about\u000athem.
p14184
aVIt had been at first unpleasant to Mrs. Harwood to acknowledge his\u000aclaims, for she preferred to ignore altogether their previous\u000acircumstances.
p14185
aVBut, seeing that it was impossible to shake him off, she\u000ahad taken the part of making the best of him and speaking freely to him\u000aof relations and connections like a woman who had nothing to conceal.
p14186
aVMeredith had friends who were well off, if he was not, for the present,\u000avery well off himself; and when it became apparent that there was a\u000amutual inclination between him and Gussy, Mrs. Harwood was glad of it,\u000apartly because his father had been one of the sufferers by her husband\u2019s\u000afailure, and might thus be partially recouped for his losses, and partly\u000abecause Meredith\u2019s mouth would thus be effectually stopped, and no\u000arevelations need be apprehended from him--though, as she sensibly\u000aremarked, \u201cWhat does any scandal matter after fifteen years?\u201d\u000a\u000aMeredith\u2019s motives were perhaps more difficult to read.
p14187
aVThey had indeed\u000abeen easy enough at first, for he had really liked Gussy, and had felt\u000aher to be as good a match as he could aspire to.
p14188
aVLatterly, however,\u000aseveral circumstances had struck him as strange in the house with which\u000ahe was so familiar.
p14189
aVThey had been scarcely of note enough to call for\u000aany consideration singly; but put together they had awakened a\u000asuspiciousness not unnatural in a mind trained to the complexities of\u000athe law.
p14190
aVHad he been ignorant of the history of the Harwoods; had he been\u000aaltogether without the tradition of animosity which lingers in the mind\u000aof a man who has a hereditary injury in his thoughts, it is probable he\u000awould not have remarked these little incidents.
p14191
aVThe chief of them was\u000aVicars, whose countenance seemed one of evil omen to the young man.
p14192
aVHe\u000ahad come by degrees to the belief that there was something in the house\u000ato be found out.
p14193
aVNothing, however, had prepared him for Janet\u2019s extraordinary revelations\u000aand for the discovery more extraordinary still which he had himself\u000amade.
p14194
aVIt was this which he turned over in his mind, viewing it from\u000aevery side, considering it in every possible light, as he walked\u000abriskly along the long line of silent streets.
p14195
aVIt seemed a thing almost\u000aincredible that an unsuspecting family could have a man hidden in their\u000ahouse with such elaborate precautions, shut up in rooms which were given\u000aout to be uninhabitable, yet surrounded with comforts, kept from all air\u000aand vision yet manifestly cared for--a mystery in the midst of the\u000acommonest matter-of-fact details of life.
p14196
aVThe face which he had seen, though but for a moment, communicated no\u000aidea to Meredith\u2019s mind.
p14197
aVIt was not like anyone whom he had ever seen\u000abefore.
p14198
aVThe long white hair, the long pallid countenance, was more like\u000athose of a hermit in the desert than of a dweller in an ordinary English\u000ahouse.
p14199
aVThe eagerness with which the young man had followed up the mystery had\u000afallen somewhat blank when he got to the climax and saw the cause of\u000aall.
p14200
aVThe thread which he had seemed to hold in his hand broke off short.
p14201
aVHe had not known or been able to imagine to what it might lead, yet had\u000aassociated it somehow with the story of the family, and expected it to\u000athrow some light upon that.
p14202
aVBut the light he had been hoping for seemed\u000asuddenly to go out as he gazed through the curtains at this strange old\u000aman.
p14203
aVWho was he?
p14204
aVWhat connection could he have with the family in whose\u000ahouse he was hidden?
p14205
aVWas it Vicars who was responsible--Vicars, who was\u000athe representative of mystery in the house--the old servant who was no\u000alonger a servant?
p14206
aVCould this be some private undertaking of his own of\u000awhich not even Mrs. Harwood was aware?
p14207
aVBut when Meredith thought of the curtains, the softly-moving noiseless\u000aspring doors, all left, no doubt, that Vicars at a moment\u2019s warning\u000amight rush back to his patient, or his prisoner, or his victim--which\u000awas it?
p14208
aVhe was again stopped suddenly as by a blank wall of\u000aimpossibility.
p14209
aVVicars could not have fitted up the rooms with all those\u000aelaborate precautions.
p14210
aVHe could not without Mrs. Harwood\u2019s knowledge\u000ahave arranged everything for secrecy and at the same time for comfort in\u000athat way.
p14211
aVWas it then some one whom Mrs. Harwood was hiding?
p14212
aVBut whom?
p14213
aVBut whom?
p14214
aVGussy and Janet and all the embarrassments connected with them died away\u000afrom Meredith\u2019s mind as this problem presented itself to his\u000aintelligence.
p14215
aVWho was it?
p14216
aVThat curious curtained room--it suddenly\u000aflashed upon his mind that it might be a padded room prepared for a\u000alunatic: and this seemed for a moment to throw an illusive light upon\u000athe problem, but only for a moment: for he could not think that Mrs.\u000aHarwood would permit Vicars to harbor a lunatic in her house, in the\u000anear neighborhood of her children; and who could it be whom she could\u000ashut up like that in lawless disregard of all rules?
p14217
aVNobody.
p14218
aVThere was\u000anot a madman in the family that he had ever heard of.
p14219
aVThis last idea, however, seized upon Meredith with greater force as he\u000aconsidered.
p14220
aVHe remembered the cry which he himself had heard more than\u000aonce, and which had been put aside with careless explanations as\u000asomething which was to be heard from time to time from a neighboring\u000ahouse, or from the streets, or a shriek from the railway, or the effect\u000aof the wind when it blew in certain directions.
p14221
aVHe remembered even to\u000ahave asked, \u201cIs there any private asylum near?\u201d and how it had been\u000asuggested by some one that there was somebody out of his mind next door.
p14222
aVHe had said that in that case he hoped the people next door were aware\u000athat it was unlawful to keep a maniac capable of uttering cries like\u000athat in an unauthorized house.
p14223
aVThis forgotten conversation suddenly surged up before him as if it had\u000abeen laid up in his memory for future use.
p14224
aVWas the man mad?
p14225
aVWas it\u000aVicars who had him in charge, backed up by his mistress, injudiciously\u000akind, or was it she who was the prime mover and Vicars only the\u000ainstrument?
p14226
aVHe puzzled about this insolvable question, turning it a long\u000atime over and over in his brain, until at last he came back to the fact\u000athat even were this matter solved to his full satisfaction it would\u000aleave him as much in the dark as before.
p14227
aVFor who was the man?
p14228
aVThis,\u000aafter all, was the only thing that it was of any importance to know.
p14229
aVMeredith made a long excursion as he walked along into all the\u000aconnections of the Harwood family of whom he had ever heard.
p14230
aVHe was\u000asomething of a genealogist, and he had the excellent memory of a\u000acountry-bred individual for all the cousins, and brothers-in-law, and\u000aconnections generally of people near home.
p14231
aVNo; he could think of nobody\u000arelated to the family on either side who had been mad or who had\u000adisappeared or failed to be accounted for.
p14232
aVThere was nobody.
p14233
aVIt could\u000anot be a mere connection, a far-off friend, who was thus cared for.
p14234
aVIt\u000amust be some one whose life was of importance, for whom secrecy was\u000anecessary; whose madness was either to be concealed under a pretence of\u000aabsence, or who was so near in love that to retain his custody the law\u000awas transgressed and defied.
p14235
aVBut there was no such person, none.
p14236
aVEverybody that had to do with the\u000aHarwoods was respectable, known, above suspicion, except the scoundrel\u000aof a husband who had died so many years ago.
p14237
aVCould it be that the widow,\u000aalready in middle age when her husband died, had loved some other man,\u000aand perhaps secretly married, or at least taken him into her house when\u000aattacked by the dreadful malady?
p14238
aVMeredith was in a very silent bit of the way when he came to this\u000ahypothesis, and its effect upon him was such that he stopped short and\u000alaughed aloud.
p14239
aVMrs. Harwood, the most irreproachable of women and\u000amothers, more than middle-aged, never moving out of her wheeled chair!
p14240
aVThat she should have a postscriptal romance--a love-affair in her\u000afifties: and that the man should go mad--of love probably--and be\u000aguarded thus as the apple of her eye!
p14241
aVShe seemed to rise before him in\u000aall her comfortable ease and motherliness--poor lady!
p14242
aVnot able to\u000awalk--to rebuke the wild imagination.
p14243
aVHe laughed, but then all at once\u000abecame grave again: for that same easy-minded woman, the respectable\u000amother, the elderly mistress of so correct a household, must be in the\u000amystery one way or another.
p14244
aVShe it must be who had settled and arranged\u000athe whole elaborate business.
p14245
aVIt could not be Vicars, who was a\u000aman-servant in no way above the level of his class.
p14246
aVHe could not have\u000adone it; could not have the means to do it, or the knowledge.
p14247
aVThe\u000amistress of the house must be involved.
p14248
aVHer purse and her brain must be\u000ain it, whoever the mysterious patient or prisoner was.
p14249
aVWho was the man?
p14250
aVBeyond that question Meredith, with all his acuteness, could not go.
p14251
aVWhat a strange sight it was, looking in at him through the curtains!
p14252
aVMeredith said to himself that the man must have been drugged to lie in\u000asuch a deep stupor of sleep.
p14253
aVSomething must have been given to him to\u000akeep him quiet, to make it possible to fill a house in which such an\u000ainmate was, with music and the sound of the dancers\u2019 feet and the hum of\u000aa lively crowd.
p14254
aVAnd the incredible rashness, temerity, of doing so--of\u000acarrying on all the gayeties of life in a house occupied by such a\u000aspectre, on the other side of the wall only from the unconscious\u000amerrymakers!
p14255
aVIt was like a woman to do that, with a regardlessness of\u000aall consequences, a want of natural logic which belonged only to women:\u000afor everybody surely must see that one time or other such a thing must\u000abe found out.
p14256
aVNothing in the whole matter was so certain as that--that\u000aone time or other it was bound to be found out.
p14257
aVIt was like a woman to\u000ado it: but even a woman, one would have thought, possessing such a\u000asecret would shut her house up and keep society at least at arm\u2019s\u000alength.
p14258
aVBut no; on the contrary, all sorts of pleasant things went on in\u000athe house.
p14259
aVIt was open to all the friends of the young people, who\u000avisited it, stayed in it, came there as freely as to the most\u000acommonplace of houses.
p14260
aVAnd all the time that man shut up in the wing!
p14261
aVAny one of them might have pushed open the door at some careless moment\u000aas Janet and he had done, and found his or her way upstairs.
p14262
aVAny one of\u000athem might have seen the spectre, so notable as he was in appearance;\u000anot a face to forget.
p14263
aVAnd what then?
p14264
aVBut Mrs. Harwood, with the incredible inconsequence of a woman, had\u000aignored all that.
p14265
aVNo doubt Vicars, to spare himself trouble, had got\u000ainto a way of leaving the door unfastened, the spring uncaught, to save\u000ahimself trouble.
p14266
aVAnd they thought they never would be found out.
p14267
aVThey\u000agave dinners and dances and asked all sorts of people to come and pass\u000awithin sound of the maniac.
p14268
aVThey might drug him, but they could not drug\u000athe spectators, who, one time or other, as sure as Nemesis, must have\u000afound out--as Charley had done.
p14269
aVBut who was the man?
p14270
aVCHAPTER XXVIII.
p14271
aVJanet had been so quickly summoned downstairs after her strange\u000aadventure that she had no leisure to think it over, until, about the\u000atime when Mr. Meredith set out on his walk, she escaped upstairs.
p14272
aVMeredith had been the very last to go away, he had stayed for the little\u000afamily supper which the house-party had made after the guests were gone.
p14273
aVHe was evidently regarded, in short, entirely as one of the family, and\u000ain that capacity claimed Mrs. Harwood\u2019s applause for his exertions in\u000amaking everything \u201cgo off.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have danced with all the plainest women,\u201d he said, \u201cand taken at\u000aleast three dowagers in to supper.
p14274
aVI ought to be very much petted now to\u000amake up.\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Harwood looked from him to Gussy uncertain what to reply.
p14275
aVBut Gussy\u000adid not meet her mother\u2019s eyes, as she most certainly would have done\u000ahad there been anything to tell.
p14276
aV\u201cOh, yes, you have been of great use,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u000ashould have done without you.
p14277
aVBut I don\u2019t believe in such magnanimity as\u000athat.
p14278
aVAnd you ought to be more civil about the dowagers when you are\u000atalking to me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are not a dowager--you are the head of the house,\u201d Meredith said,\u000abending over her affectionately to say good-night.
p14279
aVIt was not possible that Janet could be otherwise than on the watch,\u000aconsidering her own share of his attentions during the evening.
p14280
aVHe had\u000acast a laughing glance at her when he spoke of the plain women, and when\u000ahe turned to leave the house he shot another look of leave-taking,\u000atender yet laughing too, over the head of Julia, who was still at\u000asupper, consuming as many forbidden dainties as was possible in the\u000ashort space of time that remained.
p14281
aVMeredith put his hand on Julia\u2019s\u000ashoulder, which she flung off with a rapid twist, and said good-night to\u000aJanet with his eyes, so that nobody could see; and then he turned round\u000awith a laugh, complaining that all his civilities to Ju were without\u000aeffect.
p14282
aVGussy, who was pleased by this supposed attempt to conciliate\u000aher young sister, accompanied him with Dolff to the floor.
p14283
aVAnd Janet\u000acould not but wonder what kind of farewell would take place there, with\u000asomething between mirth and misery in her heart.
p14284
aVOh, he was not true.
p14285
aVIt was certain that he was not true; but we do not\u000asomehow condemn the man who cheats another on our account, as we\u000adenounce him when he deceives us on account of another.
p14286
aVThe two things\u000aare different.
p14287
aVHe should not perhaps have pretended to be affectionate\u000ato Julia in order to be at liberty to look love at Janet; but the\u000aexpedient prompted Janet to laugh.
p14288
aVThere is always something that tempts\u000athe lookers-on to laugh in a lover\u2019s wiles.
p14289
aVAnd the person who is\u000apreferred is apt to pardon and take such deceits lightly.
p14290
aVHow could he\u000aotherwise have found it possible to give her that parting look?
p14291
aVAnd\u000aJulia\u2019s wrench of her shoulder made Janet laugh in spite of herself.
p14292
aVHow\u000aridiculous of the girl to suppose that it was for her he did that!
p14293
aVAnd, to tell the truth, Janet could not think of the leading incident of\u000athe night for the shadow of these other things which pushed in front as\u000aif they were more important.
p14294
aVWhat he had said to her--what he had\u000alooked, which was more than what he had said, the touch of his hand, the\u000acurious union that had been formed between them by their mutual\u000adiscovery, that discovery which was owing to Janet, and which her\u000aobservations had alone made possible--all these things were in her mind\u000arather than the discovery itself.
p14295
aVWhen she tried to think of it she\u000afound herself thinking of him, and going over and over his words and his\u000alooks, and every particular of that so confidential and lover-like talk\u000awhich had taken place under the shadow of the evergreens.
p14296
aVWhat would\u000aGussy have said if she had seen them sitting there?
p14297
aVWhat would she have\u000athought if she had heard them?
p14298
aVIt gave Janet a keen prick of pleasure, of gratification, and trouble\u000ato think that the governess should be placed so much above the young\u000alady of the house.
p14299
aVJanet did not know what would come of it, or if\u000aanything would come of it, or if she were to blame or not.
p14300
aVBut, in the\u000ameantime, she could not help enjoying the triumph.
p14301
aVIt was not Gussy he\u000acared about, who was so much better off, but her, little Janet the\u000agoverness.
p14302
aVShe forgave him his falseness--was not everything to be\u000aforgiven to a sudden love springing up in a man\u2019s heart when hitherto he\u000ahad been giving himself up to consideration of what was best to be done\u000ain the way of a respectable marriage?
p14303
aVShe could not get these incidents\u000aout of her mind.
p14304
aVWhen she tried to think of the other matter, the thing which Meredith\u000awas studying so intently on his way home, her mind eluded that subject\u000aand came back and back to the other, the more interesting, the subject\u000awhich made her youthful heart beat.
p14305
aVShe had been much excited once by\u000aher own discoveries, by the face at the window, and indeed by the scraps\u000aof paper, until she had discovered as she thought that they were only\u000afrom a copy-book; and it was inconceivable how little she cared now for\u000athis far more important discovery.
p14306
aVBut then there were things more\u000aimportant, events more exciting to Janet\u2019s little self, which came in\u000athe way.
p14307
aVHer heart had suddenly been roused within her, a new life had\u000aopened before her.
p14308
aVIt was not noble, nor did it come with that elevating\u000aand purifying effect which a first love so often exercises, making all\u000abeautiful and excellent things congenial to the awakening spirit in the\u000afirst fervor of that new emotion.
p14309
aVJanet felt guilty, she had a breathless sense of something secret,\u000aforbidden, in her excitement and happiness.
p14310
aVThe best she could feel was\u000athe mischievous clandestine pleasure of a child in balking some little\u000arival, and triumphing over some one who had been elevated above her.
p14311
aVShe\u000adid not dare to think of Gussy, save in a ludicrous sense, as being so\u000asilly as to be taken in.
p14312
aVOh, how silly she was not to see that his\u000alooks, his secret inclinations, were not for her, that ever since Janet\u000aappeared upon the scene it was towards her that his thoughts had turned!
p14313
aVShe thought of Gussy only in this way, scorning her for being deceived;\u000aand there was nothing softening, ameliorating, or ennobling in Janet\u2019s\u000a_vita nuova_.
p14314
aVIt was made up of clandestine communications, secret\u000alooks, communings in dark corners.
p14315
aVThere had been only one of these, and\u000ayet she felt as if it had been going on for years.
p14316
aVAnd she did not know\u000awhat would come of it, or if anything could come of it.
p14317
aVHe had stepped\u000ainto a lover\u2019s place without, in so many words, telling her that he\u000aloved her; without that proposal of marriage which is the inevitable\u000aformula of love to an English girl.
p14318
aVHe had said nothing about all that.
p14319
aVJanet did not know what he intended, or if he intended anything; but\u000athis only made her heart beat all the more.
p14320
aVThus two young women in that seemingly tranquil house retired to their\u000arooms with hearts high-beating, moved to their inmost depths by Charley\u000aMeredith, who was not in the least worthy of the agitation of either,\u000anot even of Janet\u2019s half-guilty agitated excitement which she thought\u000alove, and certainly not of the emotion which made Gussy Harwood hide her\u000aface in her hands, in humiliation and misery which all the sweetness of\u000atheir recent interview could not overcome.
p14321
aVIt was sweet: and his implied\u000aassurance of the cause that kept him silent, and certainty of a definite\u000aterm to the suspense, had flooded her being with happiness for the\u000amoment; but by the time she had gained the privacy of her own room, and\u000athe excitement was over, Gussy\u2019s heart once more had sunk into the\u000adepths.
p14322
aVTo wait in this humiliating way till he should signify his\u000apleasure, to be dependent upon him for something like life itself, to\u000aattend like a handmaiden on his leisure and his choice of a time and\u000amanner of signifying his will--all this filled Gussy with humiliation\u000aand shame, still more deeply felt in that her consciousness was pervaded\u000aby it, and she felt, even while she revolted, that her happiness was in\u000ahis hands, and that she could not escape.
p14323
aVHe was not a man of great\u000aqualities, there was nothing in him to make him worthy of being the\u000aarbiter of a life.
p14324
aVAnd yet, so he was.
p14325
aVJanet went to bed, but she found that, with all these fumes of\u000aexcitement hanging about her, she could not sleep.
p14326
aVIf she dozed for a\u000afew minutes she was again with Meredith, walking along wonderful dark\u000apassages, peering through half-opened doors, seeing dreadful\u000avisions--sometimes of coffins and dead people, sometimes of threatening\u000afaces looking out upon her.
p14327
aVIn the end Janet jumped out of bed again and lighted a candle.
p14328
aVShe had\u000asuddenly thought she heard some one touch the handle of her door, and a\u000asudden vision--the face of the old man with his white beard seemed to\u000aspring out of the darkness before her.
p14329
aVAfter all, there were but a few\u000adoors between them, doors which were sometimes left unsecured.
p14330
aVWhat if,\u000awaking like herself in the middle of the night, the prisoner should find\u000aa practicable way as she had done, and come out and pass through her\u000adoor as she had done through his?
p14331
aVThe impression of some one standing\u000abeside her bed was so strong upon her in the dark, that Janet made but\u000aone spring to the opposite side, and trembling, managed, though with\u000adifficulty, to strike a match.
p14332
aVThe light relieved her from that sickening spasm of terror.
p14333
aVThere was\u000anobody there--of course she knew there could be nobody there: but it was\u000aimpossible to think of going to sleep again, thrice impossible to return\u000ato the darkness and once more imagine stealthy steps about the room and\u000athe pallid face bending over her.
p14334
aVShe put on a dressing-gown, and,\u000ataking out the scraps of paper, began with more leisure and real pains\u000ato put them together.
p14335
aVNow that she knew it was not Dolff\u2019s name that was\u000awritten at the bottom of the page, the sense of mystery returned to her\u000amind.
p14336
aVIt seemed impossible that his father\u2019s copy-books should be still\u000ain being, or that it could be of any importance who saw them.
p14337
aVJanet shivered with cold, but it was better than lying trembling in the\u000adark, thinking that the old man of the wing was walking about the room.
p14338
aVAnd she had promised to send the bits of paper to Meredith.
p14339
aVShe put them\u000aall together, piecing them as well as she could.
p14340
aVSometimes she could\u000aonly join a triangular or oblong scrap to a square one.
p14341
aVSometimes there\u000awas an absolute break which in no way could be filled out.
p14342
aVShe succeeded\u000ain making out something like this:\u000a\u000a\u201cI can\u2019t get---- I want to get out.
p14343
aVI can\u2019t get out.
p14344
aVI can\u2019t g--get out:\u000acould pay--could p----can\u2019t get----can\u2019t get--out, out, out----Money,\u000aplenty money.
p14345
aVCould pay, could p----but can\u2019t, can\u2019t, can\u2019t get out.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was mere gibberish Janet thought.
p14346
aVShe knew no meaning in it.
p14347
aVAfter\u000ashe had worked for an hour at it, she had almost thrown it away again,\u000afeeling that it was mere nonsense; whether written by the prisoner,\u000awhether, as was more likely, some childish repetitions out of a\u000acopybook, she could not tell; but at all events nonsense, throwing no\u000alight upon anything, doing no one any good.
p14348
aVShe fixed the scraps on a\u000asheet of paper, however, as well as she could piece them together, and\u000aespecially the sprawling, childish signature \u201cAdol----Char--es\u000aHar--w----.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe was very cold, very tired, and sleepy by the time this task was\u000adone.
p14349
aVShe would put it in an envelope since _he_ had asked her to do so.
p14350
aVIt would make him none the wiser, still it should be done, because he\u000ahad desired it.
p14351
aVShe forgot altogether the central incident of the night\u000aas she went back to bed with little, cold feet, shivering and sleepy.
p14352
aVThe foolishness of the words she had been so carefully picking out and\u000apasting together somehow emancipated her from her terror, they were so\u000asilly and without meaning.
p14353
aVShe did not believe, after all, they could\u000ahave any connection with the mystery in the wing.
p14354
aVBut as she thought of\u000athe address, and that she must take it herself to the post lest any one\u000ashould see it and think it a communication of a different kind, a thrill\u000aran through her, and she could not help thinking of perhaps a time to\u000acome when there might be other communications that would not be so\u000acolorless.
p14355
aVJanet\u2019s heart felt the lifting tide of a secret happiness.
p14356
aVShe fell into a delicious drowsiness, in which all his words and looks\u000aand movements came back upon her in a maze of pleasant confusion: and\u000athen, with the privilege of her age, she fell fast asleep.
p14357
aVJanet posted her letter next day, glad to be rid of it; for she could\u000anot, all the morning, get over the terror in her mind lest she should\u000apull the letter out of her pocket with her pocket-handkerchief, or\u000asomehow expose it to be looked at, and so call forth the comment which\u000ashe felt already ringing in her ears, as if any one she met in the\u000astreet might come up and call it out to her:\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, are you in correspondence with Charley Meredith?\u201d \u201cWhat have you to\u000asay to Charley Meredith?\u201d\u000a\u000aShe thought she could see Gussy\u2019s look if that dreadful contingency\u000ashould come to pass.
p14358
aVIt would not be she that would make that\u000aexclamation--wonder would be the sentiment in her face, wonder and a\u000asort of mild haughtiness which Miss Harwood knew how to put on.
p14359
aVShe\u000awould take no notice.
p14360
aVBut she would never forget; she would go on\u000awondering, perhaps divining at last: proudly and entirely ignoring that\u000astrange incident--but she would not forget it.
p14361
aVHenceforward her eyes\u000awould have another aspect towards Janet, and even perhaps towards her\u000alover.
p14362
aVJanet breathed more freely when it was safely out of her pocket and in\u000athe post-office box.
p14363
aVNobody could see it now; she was safe, at least for\u000athe time.
p14364
aVIt is needless to say that she added not a word, explanatory\u000aor otherwise, to that curious piece of paper.
p14365
aVShe wrote the address with\u000athe greatest care in her neatest hand.
p14366
aVShe was so girlish as to think\u000athat her pretty handwriting, the fresh glossy envelope which she\u000aselected so carefully, rejecting one which had a small speck upon it,\u000aand which was a little brown at one corner--would go to his heart, and\u000athat he would remark those signs of her care to please him.
p14367
aVPoor little\u000aJanet!
p14368
aVShe was not a girl of lofty sentiments, nor a very loyal soul;\u000abut she was very young, and had a world of foolish expectation still in\u000aher inexperienced heart.
p14369
aVThus her former terror about the mystery which she had discovered so\u000aclose to her was quieted in her mind almost entirely by the coming in of\u000asomething more powerful.
p14370
aVSometimes a vague thrill of terror would pass\u000athrough her when she looked at the door so hermetically closed, the door\u000awhich had once trembled and given way under her slight fingers.
p14371
aVIn the\u000amiddle of the night she sometimes woke with a start thinking she heard\u000asome one at her door, afraid to open her eyes lest she should see the\u000awhiteness in her room of the white beard and pallid face.
p14372
aVShe took to locking her door from that time, a practice for which she\u000awas much scoffed at by Julia, who discovered it at once and wished to\u000aknow, satirically, what she was afraid of?
p14373
aVWas it robbers, and did Janet\u000athink they would come up all the way to the second floor for her,\u000ainstead of going at once to the pantry for the plate?
p14374
aVJanet could not\u000amake an answer to this assault, but she continued to lock her door and\u000ato look carefully around her room every night to make sure that no one\u000awas there.
p14375
aVThis, however, was the only effect that the vision in the wing had upon\u000aher.
p14376
aVAnother matter, far closer and more urgent, was introduced into her\u000athoughts.
p14377
aVThere were now two people whose whole attention was bent on\u000athe sounds outside in the still evenings when they sat over their\u000aneedlework, listening intently for a step, for the sound of the bell.
p14378
aVTo\u000ameet him and Gussy within the same four walls, to see his eyes turn to\u000aher, and know that Miss Harwood looked on, this was far more difficult\u000athan any mystery for Janet to bear.
p14379
aVCHAPTER XXIX.
p14380
aVGussy Harwood awoke next morning with a sense of exhilaration in her\u000amind, as if, during the night, some burden had rolled off her shoulders.
p14381
aVHad any burden been rolled off?
p14382
aVThe first sensation in the morning of\u000apain or pleasure is not always a true one, but there is none so poignant\u000aor which leaves so much impression on the mind.
p14383
aVA year--she said to herself--what was a year?
p14384
aVIf it were two years, what\u000awould it matter so long as all doubts were removed and she was assured\u000athat as she thought of him so he thought of her?
p14385
aVHow much better would\u000ait have been, in that point of view, if he had opened his heart to her\u000aat once!--not waiting for business or wealth or the means of setting up\u000aa house which he could ask her to share.
p14386
aVAll these were secondary\u000amatters.
p14387
aVThe thing she desired to know was his heart and what was in it.
p14388
aVIf he really loved her, as she sometimes believed he did, yet sometimes\u000adoubted, how happy it would be to watch the growth of the practice, the\u000acoming of the time when prudence and good sense would permit them to set\u000aup a new household together!
p14389
aVGussy did not desire in the least to forestall that moment, to reject\u000athe guidance of prudence.
p14390
aVFar from that.
p14391
aVHer own actions were always\u000aregulated by that rule.
p14392
aVAll that she wanted was the full understanding,\u000athe power to believe that she knew his heart as he knew hers.
p14393
aVBut she\u000asaid to herself, with a sigh,\u000a\u000a\u201cMen do not understand this.
p14394
aVThey think it not honorable to engage a\u000awoman before they are able to carry their engagement out, not knowing,\u000anot guessing, how very different is the woman\u2019s view--how that what she\u000awants is the understanding, the link between heart and heart, the\u000aprivilege of sharing their thoughts and being bound to them.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe sighed, and there was impatience and weariness in her sigh.
p14395
aVHow was\u000ait that they would not understand--that he would not understand?
p14396
aVShe\u000awould wait for him for years if it were necessary, so long as there was\u000ano doubt left upon the mutual sentiment, so long as the bond was made\u000awhich he thought it more honorable not to make till it could be quickly\u000afulfilled.
p14397
aVAnd this feeling went on growing stronger every hour of the day.
p14398
aVThe\u000afirst exhilaration departed, and the weariness came back.
p14399
aVA year!
p14400
aVAnd\u000awho could tell that in a year there might not be some new drawback, some\u000afurther suspense necessary.
p14401
aVIf men would but understand that it is not\u000ato be married that the woman wants, but to know the lover\u2019s heart, to be\u000aassured of his love!
p14402
aVWhen Molire made his _Prcieuses_ contemn the vulgar haste with which\u000atheir suitors would have jumped to the last accomplished fact of\u000amarriage, he had (perhaps) touched a secret of the feminine heart which\u000afew men divine.
p14403
aVGussy, who was not poetical, still less _prcieuse_, who was indeed a\u000avery matter-of-fact and most sensible person, would have been like the\u000afoolish Cathon and Madelon, quite pleased with the _pays du tendre_, so\u000along as her lover had led her with a faithful hand into that enchanted\u000acountry.
p14404
aVShe did not insist upon the new establishment, the immediate\u000aconclusion.
p14405
aVShe only wanted him to say frankly half-a-dozen words, and\u000aso to bind them together forever.
p14406
aVIt was half an injury to her that he\u000ashould feel it necessary to wait for such a practical reason.
p14407
aVDid he\u000athink that her love was a less thing than her word, and that so long as\u000ashe had not audibly pledged that, she was free?
p14408
aVDid he think himself\u000afree because he had not said to her, \u201cBe my wife!\u201d\u000a\u000aThese questions flitted through Gussy\u2019s mind, drifting across the sky\u000alike clouds, throughout the day.
p14409
aVShe shook her head at the vanity and\u000ashortsightedness of the thought.
p14410
aVShe free, when she loved him!
p14411
aVWould a\u000amere promise bind her more than the devotion of her whole being?
p14412
aVAnd\u000athen there came a cold shiver over Gussy\u2019s heart.
p14413
aVDid he think perhaps\u000athat _he_ was free so long as he had made no promise--that all the\u000asilent fascination which bound them together and the link that had been\u000agrowing for years, and which he had woven by so many tender words and\u000alooks and fond regards, was nothing, so long as no pledge had been given\u000aor received?
p14414
aVGussy would not allow herself to think this.
p14415
aVShe shook her head over the\u000adefects in men, the absence of a finer feeling, the want of that\u000aintuition which everybody said women possessed in a higher degree.
p14416
aVHe\u000acould not see that there was a more delicate honor in avowal than in\u000asilence.
p14417
aVIt was strange, but she was obliged to conclude that this was\u000ahow men felt, and that they did not understand.
p14418
aVGussy was also a little cast down, ashamed, almost humbled, by the\u000athought that he was in no such doubt of her sentiments as she was of\u000ahis.
p14419
aVBut, then, she asked herself--for such a problem awakens\u000ametaphysical tendencies in the most simple mind--whether perhaps her\u000adoubt of him was not as much the weakness of the woman\u2019s point of view\u000aas his reticence was of the man\u2019s?
p14420
aVPerhaps it had never entered into his\u000amind that she could doubt him after all that had come and gone.
p14421
aVPerhaps\u000ahe felt the bond between them to be so assured and true that no\u000adeclaration could make it stronger.
p14422
aVPerhaps, just as he did not\u000aunderstand her, she did not understand him, and exemplified the woman\u2019s\u000adeficiency just as he exemplified the man\u2019s.
p14423
aVThis thought sufficed to\u000aclear Gussy\u2019s brow for the whole afternoon.
p14424
aVShe told her mother, who was very eager for news, and had also expected\u000amuch from the dance, that Charley had been talking about his profession,\u000aand that he was now really getting on, and felt, he believed, the ball\u000aat his feet.
p14425
aV\u201cHe thinks that in another year or so he will be able to think of a\u000ahouse of his own,\u201d said Gussy.
p14426
aV\u201cOh!\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, with somewhat blank looks, \u201cin a year or so!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, mamma; did you expect him to jump to the heights of his profession\u000ain a moment?
p14427
aVA silk gown in six months and the woolsack perhaps in----\u201d\u000a\u000aGussy broke off with a laugh.
p14428
aVShe had replied to her mother with a look\u000aequally blank, incapable of understanding (as it seemed) what could be\u000alooked for more.
p14429
aV\u201cI am not so silly as that,\u201d said the mother.
p14430
aV\u201cI know it is very slow\u000awork getting on at the Bar.
p14431
aVStill, I thought----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat did you think?\u201d asked Gussy, with a certain scorn in the corners\u000aof her mouth.
p14432
aV\u201cMy dear, if you take that tone I shall say nothing more.
p14433
aVI had thought\u000anothing that was not quite reasonable, whatever you may think; but I\u000ashall say no more about it.
p14434
aVYou young people have your own ways of\u000amanaging matters.
p14435
aVI don\u2019t think much of them, but that, I suppose, is\u000abecause I am old-fashioned and can\u2019t understand anything so superfine as\u000ayour modes of action.
p14436
aVYou are a great deal too superior for me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI notice,\u201d said Gussy, \u201cthat whenever people are arguing, and don\u2019t\u000aknow what to say, they call those who think differently superfine and\u000asuperior.
p14437
aVIt is as good an argument as another, I suppose.\u201d\u000a\u000aThus Gussy punished her mother for putting into words the troubled\u000aintuition of her own heart.
p14438
aVIt was enough, however, to put a stop to the\u000adiscussion, which was what she desired most.
p14439
aVMrs. Harwood was so much\u000amoved that, wanting an outlet somewhere, she was driven to confiding in\u000aJanet, who came down to the drawing-room earlier than usual.
p14440
aVGussy had\u000agone out somewhere to tea.
p14441
aV\u201cI don\u2019t seem to understand the simplest questions nowadays,\u201d she said,\u000afretfully; \u201cthey all think me so old-fashioned that I am not worth\u000aconsidering.
p14442
aVDo you think it an honorable thing, Janet, or right, or\u000awise for a man to flutter for years about a girl, always coming after\u000aher, never letting her alone, so that everybody has remarked it, and yet\u000anever saying a word that could compromise him, though he has quite\u000acompromised her?
p14443
aVDo you think there is any sense in which that could be\u000acalled right?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo,\u201d said Janet, in a very low tone, smitten by sudden compunction.
p14444
aVShe had her back to Mrs. Harwood, pouring out the tea.
p14445
aV\u201cWhat do you say?
p14446
aVOh, I suppose you are just like the rest, and don\u2019t\u000asee any harm in it.
p14447
aVBut I assure you I do.
p14448
aVIf anyone haunted you like\u000athat, my dear, under my roof, I should certainly think it my duty to\u000ainterfere.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, I hope not, Mrs Harwood; isn\u2019t that surely the very worst thing\u000athat can be done--to interfere----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cInterfere!\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, indignantly; \u201cI should soon interfere.
p14449
aVI\u000ashould not let anything like that go on, I promise you.
p14450
aVThe worst is,\u201d\u000ashe went on, with a troubled countenance, \u201cthat with one\u2019s own----\u201d\u000a\u000aShe stopped here, finding further revelation, perhaps, injudicious; but\u000aapparently the mere suggestion of interference in one case showed the\u000apossibility of doing so in another.
p14451
aVShe had taken the cup of tea from\u000aJanet\u2019s hand, who sat down opposite her, in a way which was very\u000afamiliar and home-like, and Mrs. Harwood\u2019s mouth was opened.
p14452
aVAfter a\u000apause she began, with a little laugh,\u000a\u000a\u201cMy son is not of that kind.
p14453
aVI wonder, by the way, what has become of\u000ahim that he is not in for tea?
p14454
aVHe is rather the other way.
p14455
aVHe goes a\u000agreat deal too fast.
p14456
aVIf ever he thinks he is in love he will blurt out\u000aeverything at once, and perhaps find himself bound for life to some one\u000awhom he has only known for a few days.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is even more dangerous than the other way,\u201d said Janet, with\u000aexceeding demureness, in the half light.
p14457
aV\u201cWorse for the man, but not for the woman, who gets everything she\u000awants.
p14458
aVThe other is a great deal better for the man, who holds off until\u000ahe is quite sure----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOne would think, then, that you rather approve of that last way, though\u000aI thought you had condemned it; but perhaps it is only for your son you\u000awould like it, and not for other people----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t approve it at all,\u201d cried Mrs. Harwood, hotly.
p14459
aV\u201cA girl\u2019s best\u000ayears may be wasted like that--always waiting and waiting--and perhaps\u000asome other cut her out in the end.
p14460
aVYou can\u2019t think I should approve of\u000athat, my dear.
p14461
aVI only say that Dolff, poor boy, is all the other way,\u000aand will most likely fling himself at the head of the first girl he\u000afancies, which would be a pity for the girl too, for Dolff will not be\u000avery well off.
p14462
aVHe has got his grandfather\u2019s little property in Wales,\u000awhich is entailed on him, but he has in reality nothing more: though\u000aperhaps people might think otherwise, seeing him always treated as if he\u000awere the master of the house.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet made no answer for a minute or two, and then, with a not unnatural\u000ainstinct of combativeness, it occurred to her to carry the war into the\u000aenemy\u2019s country.
p14463
aVShe asked: \u201cHave you been very long in this house, Mrs. Harwood?\u201d in her\u000amost childlike voice.
p14464
aV\u201cEh?
p14465
aVOh!
p14466
aVin this house?
p14467
aVWe came about fifteen years ago when Julia was a\u000ababy,\u201d she answered, briefly.
p14468
aV\u201cYou must have done a great deal to it to make it so pretty.
p14469
aVAnd have\u000ayou really never used the wing?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe wing?\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Harwood, in the first impulse of astonishment, raised her eyes and\u000astared at Janet, but said no more.
p14470
aV\u201cIt looks,\u201d said Janet, \u201cas if it must be such a nice, well-shaped\u000aroom--or perhaps there is more than one room?
p14471
aVMany people would be so\u000aglad to have that little additional space.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou seem to know a great deal about it,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, \u201cthough I\u000adon\u2019t quite know how, for it has been shut up for years, and none of the\u000aservants even have ever been in.
p14472
aVIt is full of old furniture from my\u000ahome in Wales--and other lumber.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo be sure,\u201d said Janet, \u201ca nice lumber-room where you can put\u000aeverything is of great use.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, it is of great use; and, as it happens it would be of no\u000aparticular use in any other way; for we have as many rooms as we want,\u000aand two or three for visitors--which is as much as anybody could desire\u000ain London.
p14473
aVOf course it is a different thing in a country house.
p14474
aVHow is\u000ait that you have formed such a very clear idea of the wing, Janet?
p14475
aVMany\u000apeople never find it out.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI suppose,\u201d said Janet, \u201cbecause I have been walking so much in the\u000agarden lately, and one goes all the round of the house, and one\u000aspeculates----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOn what, I should like to know?\u201d cried Mrs. Harwood, sitting bolt\u000aupright in her chair.
p14476
aV\u201cOh, nothing; only on the shape of the house, and what a nice corner it\u000aseems, and so much sun.
p14477
aVPerhaps I was so bold as to think it would make\u000aa nice school-room,\u201d said Janet, with a little laugh, \u201cand so shut off\u000afrom the rest of the house.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, if that is all!\u201d said Mrs. Harwood.
p14478
aVShe resumed, after a moment, \u201cI\u000awould not advise it for that use.
p14479
aVOf course I don\u2019t myself believe in\u000aanything of the kind, but there are curious stories about it, about\u000athings that have been heard--and seen too, I believe.
p14480
aVThe last people\u000awho lived here were very queer people.
p14481
aVI can\u2019t tell you all that was\u000asaid of them.
p14482
aVThe door of communication used to be open, but the\u000aservants in a body begged that it might be shut up.
p14483
aVYou have noticed,\u000aperhaps, that it is quite done away with.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIs it built up?\u201d asked Janet, with great innocence.
p14484
aV\u201cBuilt up?
p14485
aVoh, no, that\u2019s a strong step to take.
p14486
aVAfter us there might\u000acome somebody who would want to use it, and building up is a strong\u000astep.
p14487
aVBut it\u2019s almost the same--it is fastened up very effectually, so\u000athat no one can either come or go--not even,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, with\u000aan abrupt laugh, \u201ca ghost.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut Vicars,\u201d said Janet, pursuing the investigation, \u201ccan go out and\u000ain, I suppose?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cVicars?\u201d cried Mrs. Harwood.
p14488
aV\u201cWhat do you suppose he has to do with it?
p14489
aVOh, I know now.
p14490
aVYou have heard that he lives on the ground-floor.
p14491
aVSo he\u000adoes; but his rooms open from outside, as you may have seen.
p14492
aVYou must\u000akeep your eyes very well about you, Janet, to have found out all that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo,\u201d said Janet; \u201cI only can\u2019t help seeing things--that is, some\u000athings.
p14493
aVAnd, to tell the truth, I have heard once or twice a curious\u000anoise which has frightened me very much.
p14494
aVAnd I never had heard any of\u000athe stories, so it was all the more strange.\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Harwood looked at her for a few moments with a fixed look; veiling\u000aher face, however, by means of the cup of tea which she had raised to\u000aher lips.
p14495
aVThen she relapsed again into a laugh.
p14496
aV\u201cYou must not take such foolish fancies into your head, my dear.
p14497
aV_I_\u000adon\u2019t believe in anything of the kind.
p14498
aVYou may be sure there is some\u000aquite simple explanation of it--the wind in a chimney, or some other\u000atrick of acoustics, as they call it.
p14499
aVYou are far too sensible to believe\u000ain ghosts or mysterious noises.
p14500
aVThere is Dolff, I think, at the door.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope the tea is strong enough for him.
p14501
aVHe likes it strong,\u201d said\u000aJanet.
p14502
aV\u201cOh, I am sure it will do very well.
p14503
aVJanet!
p14504
aVbe careful how you mention\u000asuch a thing to Dolff.
p14505
aVHe is very imaginative and impressionable.
p14506
aVI\u000adon\u2019t want his mind to be disturbed about the house.
p14507
aVPay a little\u000aattention to me, my dear; I am quite in earnest in what I say.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI shall certainly pay attention to whatever you tell me, Mrs. Harwood.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI know you will.
p14508
aVI know you will!
p14509
aVNot another word about it, as he is\u000ajust coming in--nor to anyone, if you please, my dear.
p14510
aVThe servants get\u000ahold of such things, and make a story out of them, however small the\u000aincident may be; and there is a continual fuss, with their frights and\u000atheir imaginations.
p14511
aVYou may mention it to Gussy if you like, but to no\u000aone else.
p14512
aVWell, Dolff, we were just wondering what kept you so late for\u000atea.
p14513
aVGussy and Ju have gone out to a tea-party, but I always calculate\u000aupon you to hand me my piece of cake.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have got Miss Summerhayes, mother,\u201d said Dolff, as if that was all\u000athat anyone could require.

aVJanet withdrew as quickly as she could from the drawing-room when she\u000ahad given Dolff the tea which he now took so regularly, and which his\u000afamily considered such a sign of mental and moral reformation.
p14516
aVThere was\u000aindeed no chance of being left alone with him, which was the thing of\u000aall others she most wished to avoid, for Mrs. Harwood could not go away,\u000aand was always present when she had once been wheeled into the room; but\u000aJanet knew that Dolff would ask her to come to the piano, and take\u000aadvantage of the withdrawal there to say things to her which made it\u000avery difficult to keep him at arm\u2019s length as she wished.
p14517
aVShe turned\u000aaway while he was talking to his mother, stealing out of the room,\u000aknowing that her absence would be felt by both, but longing to escape,\u000afeeling the agitation and excitement more than she could bear.
p14518
aVAnd there\u000acould be no doubt that to-night that agitation would be stronger than\u000aever, for Meredith was sure to come to talk over the dance, as was\u000aalmost necessary considering his intimacy in the house; and her heart\u000abeat wildly when she thought of meeting him again in the presence of\u000athem all, Gussy and Dolff, and the mother whose secret they had\u000adiscovered.
p14519
aVAll of the three were more or less wronged in that secret\u000aalliance which had been formed between Meredith and Janet; an alliance,\u000awas it, or a conspiracy?
p14520
aVThe girl shrank into herself for a moment when\u000ashe thought of this, and of the unsuspecting family who knew nothing of\u000ait, and would receive Meredith with such warm kindness, and was so good\u000ato herself.
p14521
aVShe shrank--but then forgot everything else in the\u000aconsciousness that she should meet him to-night--that once more they\u000awould be in the same room, and that with his eyes at least he would say\u000ato her many wonderful agitating things.
p14522
aVPerhaps this secrecy, and the absorbing excitement there was in meeting\u000ahim under the eyes of those who were so deceived, who were so little\u000aaware of what was going on beneath, held Janet\u2019s interest more than\u000aanything else.
p14523
aVA conspiracy has always a strange fascination in it, and\u000ato carry on secret communications in the face of every scrutiny, and\u000abalk suspicion, and baffle watchfulness, has, especially to the very\u000ayoung, a piquancy which legitimate intercourse often does not have.
p14524
aVJanet could not escape the sense of guilt, but the interest, the\u000adramatic combinations that would be gone through in the evening, her own\u000aposition as the heroine of the situation, a place which Gussy thought\u000awas hers, but which was not hers, was too strong, or Janet\u2019s conscience\u000atoo weak to conquer.
p14525
aVEverything yielded to the thought of what he would\u000asay.
p14526
aVHow he would manage all the conflicting elements, whether he would\u000abe able to say a word to her to tell her if he had received her letter.
p14527
aVIt was far more engrossing, far more absorbing than any play.
p14528
aVAnd it may be imagined what a party it was that sat awaiting Meredith in\u000athe bright room where Mrs. Harwood sat, with the dimmer one beyond,\u000awhere all the light centred in the white keys of the piano.
p14529
aVGussy was\u000afull of an expectation, not quite serene indeed, but calmer than might\u000ahave been supposed; for, now that she knew all immediate change to be\u000aimpossible, she had schooled herself to think that what had been said\u000aabout a year was in itself a sort of decision upon which, since better\u000acould not be, her position for the future might be founded.
p14530
aVShe awaited\u000ahis coming, accordingly, with more composure than usual, with a sort of\u000asecret assurance, as almost her betrothed--kept from being so only by\u000athat exaggerated sense of honor which made her impatient sometimes, yet\u000awas nevertheless, in its way, in the mistaken way of men, a high\u000aquality.
p14531
aVTo be able to think highly of the man she loves, although she\u000amay think him mistaken, or even wrong--to believe that he is wrong in\u000awhat is, according to his lights, a chivalrous and high-minded way, is\u000aalways delightful to a woman.
p14532
aVShe had reasoned herself into this view of\u000athe matter, and she sat accordingly in what poor Gussy thought was her\u000amost becoming dress, with a countenance full of light and a heart full\u000aof trembling comfort, awaiting her lover.
p14533
aVDolff was a little sulky: he was disappointed and troubled that Janet\u000ahad run away from him after tea, just when they might have had, he said\u000ato himself, a quiet hour, undisturbed by anyone, either for music or\u000atalk.
p14534
aVNow that fellow Meredith would come and take possession of the\u000apiano, and make an exhibition of himself and his singing all\u000anight--keeping everybody else out in the cold.
p14535
aVDolff thought that it was\u000anot fair.
p14536
aVHe ought to be the first to be considered in the house; not a\u000afellow who has not even the pluck to speak out, who was dangling on\u000aforever without coming to anything.
p14537
aVThat would never be Dolff\u2019s case.
p14538
aVDifficulty in making up his mind was not a fault of his.
p14539
aVHe knew what he\u000awanted, and, by Jove, he would have it, too, whatever his mother might\u000asay.
p14540
aVThey would want him to marry somebody with money, he knew; but\u000athere was only one woman in the world whom he would ever marry, and what\u000adid it matter to him whether they gave their consent or not?
p14541
aVThus he mused, sitting as near as he could to Janet, talking to her\u000aabout the music.
p14542
aVTalking about music threw dust in the eyes of his\u000amother and sister, and stopped any interference on their part--and _she_\u000aunderstood well enough what he meant.
p14543
aVShe was so quick--at the first\u000aword, almost before you were aware yourself, she knew what you meant.
p14544
aVShe was the most wonderful creature that had ever been born; there was\u000anone like her, none.
p14545
aVI wonder if Mrs. Harwood, sitting by the side of the fire, had any idea\u000awhat was going on in the minds of the young people who surrounded her,\u000aand who were ready to start, at a word from her, to do anything she\u000awanted.
p14546
aVThey all thought she had not.
p14547
aVGussy believed that her mother,\u000asave for the momentary surprise she had expressed, was entirely\u000asatisfied with Meredith, and calmly considered him as one of the family.
p14548
aVDolff thought that his rising passion for Janet would burst upon his\u000amother as a great discovery, calling forth her wrath and (ineffectual)\u000aresistance when he should announce it to her.
p14549
aVAnd Janet?
p14550
aVJanet was the\u000aonly one who was not so sure.
p14551
aVShe was quicker in perception than either\u000aof them; and there were looks in Mrs. Harwood\u2019s eyes sometimes which did\u000anot consist with the quiescence of her _rle_ as a mere good-natured\u000amother of a family, living only to humor her children.
p14552
aVBesides, Janet\u000awas aware of the secret in this genial woman\u2019s life.
p14553
aVShe knew that there\u000amust have been something deeper, something more tragical in it than\u000aanybody suspected.
p14554
aVMrs. Harwood, motionless in her chair, taking every accident with such\u000aperfect good-humor, smoothing everybody down, no doubt observing\u000aeverything, was the one in the party of whom Janet was afraid.
p14555
aVBut her\u000achildren were so well accustomed to her, so dutifully, habitually\u000adisregardful of her, taking her for granted, as children do, that they\u000amade little account of her watchfulness and knowledge.
p14556
aV\u201cMamma takes no\u000anotice,\u201d they said and thought.
p14557
aV\u201cI wish you\u2019d just try over this thing with me, Miss Summerhayes.
p14558
aVI want\u000ato have it perfect,\u201d said Dolff.
p14559
aV\u201cOh, please do give us a little respite, Dolff--we know all your songs\u000aby heart.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI did not ask you,\u201d said Dolff, with fraternal rudeness.
p14560
aV\u201cSo do I know\u000aall your songs by heart--and Meredith\u2019s--and I don\u2019t think much of them.
p14561
aVBesides, this is none of my old songs,\u201d he said, with a little shyness.
p14562
aV\u201cIt\u2019s one Miss Summerhayes looked up for me, and I know you\u2019ll like it,\u000amother--something old and nice--not classical, which is not in my\u000away----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI should think not, indeed,\u201d said Gussy, with scorn.
p14563
aV\u201cOr the other, which I used to like: but I don\u2019t care for them now.
p14564
aVMiss\u000aSummerhayes--oh,\u201d he continued, rudely, \u201chere\u2019s that fellow; I suppose\u000awe shall have to give it up for to-night?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is no reason why you should give up, Dolff.
p14565
aVYou speak as if\u000aCharley--who has far more sense--would ever interfere with you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, I know!\u201d said Dolff, digging his hands into his pockets.
p14566
aVHe brought\u000athe song he had intended to sing to Janet, and standing behind her chair\u000ashowed her how he had marked it in consonance with her teachings.
p14567
aV\u201cYou\u000asaid this was to be very _piano_\u201d said Dolff, \u201cit\u2019s not how the stupid\u000aprinters have done it, but I am sure you know best.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis appeal to her, though she felt it almost intolerable, carried Janet\u000athrough the moment of Meredith\u2019s entrance.
p14568
aVGussy rose to meet him, going\u000aforward a step involuntarily with the instinctive air of being the\u000aperson most concerned.
p14569
aVHe shook hands with Janet as with the rest,\u000apressing her hand as she hoped he did not press the others, till she had\u000anearly cried out, and giving her a look under his eyebrows, which she\u000afelt to mean that he had received her communication.
p14570
aVAnd then he sat\u000adown, and Dolff retreated, giving up to the superior influence.
p14571
aVMeredith\u000abrought in with him a changed atmosphere altogether.
p14572
aVThe humdrum family\u000aroutine, with all its little subdued oppositions and disagreements, but\u000adull surface of unity, quickened into interest.
p14573
aVHe divided his smiling\u000alooks, his little flattering bantering speeches, among them all.
p14574
aV\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201clet\u2019s talk of last night.
p14575
aVI suppose that\u2019s still\u000auppermost in all our minds.
p14576
aVI hope that you are all quite convinced that\u000ait was the greatest possible success.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou know,\u201d said Gussy, \u201cwe are not very sanguine people in this family.
p14577
aVWe are always seized with secret doubts afterwards whether all our\u000afriends were not making believe to enjoy themselves.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI cannot say that is my frame of mind,\u201d said her mother; \u201cyes, I\u000athought it went off very well.
p14578
aVEverybody looked pleased; they ate a very\u000agood supper, and there was no getting them out of the house.
p14579
aVI don\u2019t at\u000aall think they were making believe.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh, mamma, but you\u2019re not quite a Harwood, as I often tell you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are the best judge, Mrs. Harwood,\u201d said Meredith, \u201cfor you look on\u000aand see the game.
p14580
aVWe are all so much engaged in thinking of our own\u000aparts that we never take in the whole.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI see, perhaps, more that I am supposed to see; but I don\u2019t pretend to\u000abe omniscient, Charley, as you give me credit for.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWith an eye for everything,\u201d he said, laughing--\u201cfor our vagaries, all\u000aand sundry, and for the supper, and for Vicars and who knows how many\u000aprivate matters besides.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cVicars,\u201d said Gussy; \u201che is the least of mamma\u2019s cares, I should think.
p14581
aVHe is the most invaluable person for such a party as we had last night.
p14582
aVHe is the best servant I ever saw, though one might think, as he does so\u000alittle household work, that he would get out of the way.
p14583
aVBut he doesn\u2019t.
p14584
aVHe never forgets anything----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, that\u2019s a great deal to say,\u201d said Meredith, again with a laugh.
p14585
aV\u201cI\u000athink I\u2019ve seen occasions on which he has been caught out.\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Harwood took no notice of this, though her attention quickened.
p14586
aV\u201cVicars,\u201d she said, tranquilly, \u201cis a very old servant; but I think you\u000amay give me some credit, for I superintended everything last night.\u201d\u000a\u000aMeredith gave Janet a look.
p14587
aVDid anybody see it, could anyone notice it,\u000abut herself?
p14588
aVThe secret that they both knew seemed to burn between them\u000alike a link of fire.
p14589
aV\u201cEverything,\u201d he said, \u201cis a big word.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe laugh with which he accompanied this seemed to Janet full of\u000asuggestion, and as if he intended his hearers to understand that there\u000awas something beneath; but this was probably only her excited\u000aconsciousness, for he began at once to plunge into details of how Miss\u000aRobinson danced all the evening with Mr. Green, and the hard ado he\u000ahimself had to prevent two rival mothers from coming to blows.
p14590
aV\u201cFor I hope you all saw how I devoted myself to supper and the old\u000aladies,\u201d he said.
p14591
aV\u201cYou did not dance very much, I perceived,\u201d said Gussy.
p14592
aV\u201cNo; and chiefly with the plain people, the people who had no partners.\u201d\u000aHe sent a laughing glance towards Janet.
p14593
aV\u201cIndeed, I think I may give\u000amyself credit for having quite fulfilled my _rle_ of the next\u000afriend--the next after the son of the house.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDolff does not understand his duties in that way,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood.
p14594
aV\u201cHe dances with all the prettiest people, and never goes near the\u000adowagers; but Charley, I think, is taking too much credit to himself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou seem to me,\u201d said Dolff, returning from the outer room still with\u000ahis hands in his pockets, \u201cto be making a great deal of talk about\u000anothing.
p14595
aVI didn\u2019t see that it required such dreadful exertions to make\u000athe dance go off.
p14596
aVIt went off of itself, as dances usually do, so far as\u000aI can see.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDolff settles the matter like a Daniel come to judgment.
p14597
aVWell, I can\u000aonly say for myself that last night is one that I shall remember all my\u000alife.
p14598
aVFor finding out more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of\u000ain anyone\u2019s philosophy, commend me to a dance.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFinding out?\u201d said Gussy, with a look of surprise.
p14599
aV\u201cOh, yes; the hearts are uncovered like the shoulders, and all the\u000acorners of the house open.
p14600
aVDon\u2019t you agree with me, Miss Summerhayes?\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet fell a thrill of terror come over her.
p14601
aVWhat did he mean?
p14602
aVWas he\u000agoing to disclose their discovery, to demand explanations?
p14603
aV\u201cI don\u2019t think,\u201d she said, faltering, \u201cthat I--wanted to find out\u000aanything.
p14604
aVIt was a very nice dance.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s what I say,\u201d, said Dolff.
p14605
aV\u201cI don\u2019t understand metaphysics.
p14606
aVBut\u000ait was not quite such a nice dance as I hoped,\u201d he said once more,\u000astooping over Janet\u2019s chair.
p14607
aVIt is probable that this last little speech was not intended to be\u000aheard, but there was a pause at this moment, and as a matter of fact it\u000awas audible enough.
p14608
aVMrs. Harwood and Gussy both looked towards the\u000aspeaker, whose boyish face was a little flushed as he looked down upon\u000athe governess.
p14609
aVIt diverted their attention from the fact that there was\u000asomething strange, not quite comprehensible, in what Meredith had said.
p14610
aVThey were not susceptible about the discoveries that could be made in\u000atheir house; perhaps, Gussy thought, though his language was a little\u000astrange, that all he said was directed to herself, to impress upon her\u000athe communications of last night, and to make it more and more evident\u000ato her that, little as had been said then, he considered the evening a\u000aturning-point in his life.
p14611
aVShe was very willing to adopt this view.
p14612
aVIt\u000aflattered all her feelings, and confirmed her wishes.
p14613
aVHe was wrong, oh,\u000avery wrong, in that point of honor of his; but he was very anxious.
p14614
aVAnd\u000athat, notwithstanding the visionary necessity that sealed his lips, she\u000ashould fully understand him she threw herself into the discussion and\u000aled him on to the gossip of which he was a master, and which amused Mrs.\u000aHarwood.
p14615
aVThey took all the ladies and their toilets to pieces, and\u000aMeredith had various stories, funny and otherwise, to tell of the men.
p14616
aVIn society of every kind the characters of the absent are often torn to\u000apieces with no particular motive, or one which is half good, to divert\u000athe minds of the audience from more important things.
p14617
aVThe friends of the\u000aHarwoods suffered in this way, because the situation had become, nobody\u000aknew how, somewhat strained, and the conversation, no one could\u000aunderstand wherefore, uncomfortably significant--and this holocaust was\u000aoffered up with the usual advantageous results.
p14618
aVCHAPTER XXXI.
p14619
aVIt was certainly impossible that any communication could take place in\u000awords between Janet and Meredith on the evening above recorded.
p14620
aVHe\u000asqueezed her hand significantly indeed, and looked volumes at her from\u000aunder his eyebrows--but looks, though they may express volumes of\u000atenderness and sentiment, are not much to be relied upon as regards\u000afacts, and explanations cannot be given in them nor appointments made.
p14621
aVJanet was accordingly more tantalized and excited than satisfied by\u000athese glances; and she found that when Meredith drew Gussy as usual to\u000athe piano, and the ordinary duet began, it was with feelings\u000aconsiderably changed that she regarded this pair, who the last time they\u000aperformed together she had watched with a half-comic, satirical sense\u000athat the woman was much more deeply moved than the man, and a\u000amischievous half pleasure in perceiving how he played with her.
p14622
aVBut now Janet was conscious of other feelings; not all the confidential\u000aglances he could bestow upon her could keep her from feeling a keen pang\u000aas she watched the two together, the close approach of his head to hers,\u000athe caressing gesture with which he would bend over Gussy.
p14623
aVShe had\u000asmiled at all that before with a kittenish amusement, half guilty yet\u000aundisturbed by any pain, thinking if Gussy only knew what her lover\u2019s\u000alooks said to the looker-on!
p14624
aVBut now Janet had ceased to be a looker-on.
p14625
aVShe was one of the players in the drama, the one secretly preferred, to\u000awhom all those sweetnesses were due.
p14626
aVShe felt a silent pang rise in her\u000ainstead of the amusement.
p14627
aVShe was very angry, not sorry, for Gussy, the\u000adeluded, and angry beyond words with him.
p14628
aVHow did he dare to do it?
p14629
aVWhat\u000awas his motive?
p14630
aVIf it was she, Janet, whom he loved, what was the use\u000aof keeping up this pretence and flattering Gussy with the vain\u000aimagination that she was the object of his thoughts?
p14631
aVIt was a great change to have been made in a single night, and it\u000aaltered Janet\u2019s views of many things.
p14632
aVShe had no longer the feeling of\u000asuperiority which her spectator position gave her, and from which she\u000ahad despised Gussy for her easy subjugation and delusion, as well as\u000apitied her.
p14633
aVNow Gussy had become her enemy, stealing what belonged to\u000aher, since she could talk to him freely, go away with him into the\u000abackground, where they were comparatively alone, and could say what they\u000apleased to each other.
p14634
aVThus the evening was full of torture to Janet.
p14635
aVShe began to pay the\u000apenalty.
p14636
aVShe could not endure Dolff, who came to her perpetually with\u000asome little remark or reference, and whom she repulsed with an\u000aimpatience which took him entirely by surprise; nor Julia, whose\u000aretirement from the scene necessitated also the withdrawal of the\u000agoverness.
p14637
aVJulia was very tired after the dissipations of the previous\u000anight.
p14638
aVShe yawned \u201cher head off,\u201d as Dolff eloquently said; her eyes\u000awould not keep open.
p14639
aV\u201cYou had better go to bed, Ju,\u201d said her mother; \u201cyou were up so late\u000alast night.\u201d\u000a\u000aJulia, after the inevitable resistance which every child, even of\u000afifteen, and however sleepy, offers to that suggestion, rose at last to\u000aobey it.
p14640
aV\u201cAre you coming, Janet?\u201d she said; \u201cyou must be tired too.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet rose after a struggle with herself.
p14641
aVShe had the greatest mind to\u000arebel, to break the bondage of custom, to ask whether she might not\u000astay.
p14642
aVBut what was the use?
p14643
aVonly to have another look perhaps, or\u000asqueeze of the hand, as he went away, more exasperating than\u000aconsolatory.
p14644
aVAs she followed Julia out of the room she gave a glance, at\u000athe pair and saw that Meredith was stooping over Gussy\u2019s chair, saying\u000asomething in her ear, at which she, leaning back almost upon his\u000ashoulder, smiled with her face half turned towards the door.
p14645
aVWas he\u000acarrying it so far, false and cruel as he was, as to make a jest at\u000aJanet\u2019s expense after all that had happened?
p14646
aVJanet felt herself stung to\u000athe heart.
p14647
aVShe ran upstairs with a burning sensation in her breast, as\u000aif a knife had gone through her, and flung herself upon her bed in a\u000aparoxysm of anger and misery.
p14648
aVTo make confidences to her on the subject\u000aof Gussy was one thing--it made her laugh, though no doubt it was bad of\u000ahim (yet humorous) to do it, but to make confidences to Gussy about\u000aher--this idea fired Janet with anguish and rage beyond words.
p14649
aVIt was the custom in the Harwood family, as in many other virtuous\u000ahouses, that the letters should be placed by the side of the plates at\u000abreakfast, each member of the family finding his or her correspondence\u000awhen he or she appeared--a custom which has its inconveniences if any\u000aindividual of the family has anything to conceal.
p14650
aVIt had never occurred\u000ato Janet before to receive any letter which had not the Clover postmark,\u000aor at least came from some one in that old home; and it was an object of\u000acuriosity to Julia to see a litter of letters lying by the governess\u2019s\u000aplate.
p14651
aV\u201cOh, what a lot of letters Janet has to-day,\u201d she said.
p14652
aVDolff, who sat on Janet\u2019s side of the table, cast an involuntary look at\u000athem as he passed.
p14653
aVShe was herself a little late that morning, not yet\u000adownstairs, and it gave the foolish boy pleasure even to read her name.
p14654
aVBut as he glanced a look of consternation came upon Dolff\u2019s face.
p14655
aVHe\u000auttered a suppressed exclamation, and looked again, then flushed\u000acrimson, an effect which was not so pretty on his boyish bearded face as\u000ait is on a girl\u2019s.
p14656
aV\u201cWhat is the matter, Dolff?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat a cad I am!
p14657
aVI am looking at Miss Summerhayes\u2019 letters,\u201d he said.
p14658
aV\u201cI daresay,\u201d said Gussy, \u201cyou won\u2019t do much harm.
p14659
aVShe has no letters but\u000afrom the vicarage and her old friends where she came from.\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff did not say anything more, but he was very watchful till Janet\u000aappeared, which she did immediately after, with many apologies.
p14660
aVHe saw\u000aher, too, look at the address on the envelope that was uppermost with a\u000astart, and then she put her letters hastily away in her pocket.
p14661
aV\u201cYou know we all read our letters, Janet,\u201d said Gussy, \u201cand stand on no\u000aceremony.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI know, thanks; but it does not matter.
p14662
aVMy Clover news will keep: it is\u000amuch diluted generally, and I am so late this morning.
p14663
aVI cannot think\u000awhat has made me so late.\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff was very silent at that morning meal.
p14664
aVHe scarcely spoke to anyone.
p14665
aVHe had none of the remarks to make which he was generally so anxious to\u000aexpend upon Miss Summerhayes.
p14666
aVIf anybody had been specially interested\u000ain Dolff it would have been seen that he watched every movement Janet\u000amade--not as he usually did, but with a suspicious, anxious inspection.
p14667
aVBut his sisters were indifferent, and Janet herself too much excited to\u000apay any attention to him.
p14668
aVShe did not know that he had seen her letter.
p14669
aVWhen she saw it, she cast a quick glance at the other side of the table\u000ato see if by any chance Julia or Gussy had noted a handwriting which\u000amust have been familiar.
p14670
aVBut they were both entirely unconscious, at\u000atheir ease; and she never thought of Dolff.
p14671
aVIt was unlikely that a man\u000ashould have looked at her letters, but one of the girls might have done\u000ait with that more lively curiosity which girls have about little things.
p14672
aVJulia might have done it \u201cfor fun;\u201d but Janet did not think of Dolff.
p14673
aVShe was, therefore, quite at ease so far as they were concerned, though\u000athe letter burned her pocket, demanding to be read.
p14674
aVAs soon as she had\u000aan excuse to rise from the table she did so, still unaware of the\u000aspectator, full of heavy thoughts, who said to himself, \u201cNow she is\u000agoing to read it.
p14675
aVShe will not trust herself to read it before any of\u000aus.\u201d He did not know that there was any special reason why Meredith\u000ashould write to Janet.
p14676
aVHad it been Julia who had seen it she would have\u000asaid so, and Janet would doubtless have found an explanation.
p14677
aVBut Dolff\u000asaid nothing.
p14678
aVA letter in Meredith\u2019s hand--Meredith, who was, or should\u000abe, his sister\u2019s pledged and affianced lover--who could have nothing to\u000ado with Janet that was not clandestine and guilty.
p14679
aVDolff\u2019s colorless\u000acountenance--with its light hair and light mustache, a face which was\u000amore foolish than comic, a half-innocent, half-jovial countenance--was\u000astern as that of a judge.
p14680
aVWhat had she to do with Meredith?
p14681
aVWhat did she\u000aknow of him, save as Gussy\u2019s lover?
p14682
aVWas she so far ignorant of honor and\u000avirtue that she should allow another woman\u2019s lover to write to her?
p14683
aVand\u000awhat to Janet could Meredith have to say?
p14684
aVIt was at once less, and more guilty than Dolff imagined--for it was\u000atouching the papers she had sent him that Meredith wrote--but the manner\u000aof the writing was not exactly that of a business communication.
p14685
aVMeredith wrote as follows:--\u000a\u000a     \u201cMY DEAREST--\u000a\u000a     \u201cDo you know you have set me on the right track, as I believe, by\u000a     your mad scraps of paper?
p14686
aVThey are mad, but there\u2019s method in them.
p14687
aVI am coming to your house to-night, but I shan\u2019t dare, you know, to\u000a     speak to you.
p14688
aVCome to the library, where we have met before, at\u000a     about four o\u2019clock.
p14689
aVYou can make an excuse to change books or match\u000a     worsted or something--any pretext you like, but come.
p14690
aVIt will be\u000a     dark, and I can walk with you part of the way home.
p14691
aVThere is no\u000a     telling what may come out of those papers of yours--freedom, I\u000a     think, in the first place, and the power to decide upon my own\u000a     life.
p14692
aVCome, my little Janet, my sweet little girl, at four, to your\u000a     devoted--C.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile Janet read this her heart beat and thumped upon her bosom, and\u000atook away her breath.
p14693
aVHe had no right to write to her like that.
p14694
aVIt was\u000aabominable of him, a great liberty--\u201cMy dearest!\u201d She was not his\u000adearest, she was only an acquaintance whom he had known about two\u000amonths.
p14695
aVAnd to bid her come \u201cwhere they had met before,\u201d as if she had\u000abeen in the habit of meeting him before--as if it had not been merely an\u000aaccidental or chance meeting.
p14696
aVJanet was very angry, and shed hot and\u000abitter tears.
p14697
aVBut yet to be called his dearest, though it was false, was\u000asomehow sweet.
p14698
aV\u201cHis little Janet!\u201d She was not his little Janet; he had\u000anothing to do with her.
p14699
aVHow dared he?--how dared he?
p14700
aVJanet went with scarlet cheeks to the school-room, when she heard Julia\u000amoving about there; and with her soul as much disturbed as her face.
p14701
aVHow\u000adifficult it is to attend to verbs and spelling when your heart is rent\u000abetween two things--the good which you can barely see, and are doubtful\u000aof, and which as so painful; and the evil, which has everything to\u000arecommend it except that it is evil.
p14702
aVJanet tried to put that conflict\u000aaside while she attended to Julia\u2019s lessons, thinking all the time how\u000atrifling was the one in consideration of the other, what loss of time to\u000aworry concerning the way in which she spelt disappointed.
p14703
aVIt was just as\u000amiserable a word if you spelt it one way or the other; diss-apointed\u000adoes not look so well, but Julia knew no difference.
p14704
aVPoor little girl!
p14705
aVit is perhaps as vain writing down the tale of Janet\u2019s little troubles,\u000awhile the narrator perhaps has a heart filled with things that hurt and\u000awound a great deal more.
p14706
aVBut Julia could not fail to remark those\u000ascarlet cheeks.
p14707
aV\u201cWhy are you so red?\u201d she said; \u201cyou look as if you had been scorching\u000ayour cheeks, as mamma says I do, reading over the fire.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is nothing,\u201d said Janet; \u201chave you got out all the books?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd your eyes look as if you had been crying,\u201d said Julia.
p14708
aVHow the lessons were got through it would have been difficult for Janet\u000ato tell.
p14709
aVAs it happened, in the afternoon things arranged themselves for\u000aher in the most wonderful way so as to leave her free.
p14710
aVJulia went out\u000awith Gussy to another tea-party, which was a thing she detested, and an\u000aold friend of Mrs. Harwood\u2019s came to call.
p14711
aVThe old lady liked to be left\u000aalone with her visitor when it was an old friend, so that Janet had\u000aperfect command of her time.
p14712
aVIt seemed done on purpose, she thought, by\u000asome spirit opposed to good resolutions, for she had thought that she\u000acould not, must not go.
p14713
aVShe would not, it was treachery to her present\u000ahome, it was undignified on her own part, obeying a call which was\u000areally a careless command, which was given as if it would be beyond her\u000apower to resist it.
p14714
aVShe would not go!
p14715
aVBut then came the other side of the question.
p14716
aVIt might, he had said, be\u000avery important to him to get the clue, and he had found it.
p14717
aVHe would\u000await for her, and be terribly disappointed when she did not come.
p14718
aVHe\u000amight have some other important question to ask her, something in which\u000ashe could give him real help.
p14719
aVThe woman who deliberates is lost.
p14720
aVAfter a\u000agreat deal of self-discussion, Janet put on her hat hastily, as if by\u000astealth, and went out.
p14721
aVIt was half dark already, though it was not four\u000ao\u2019clock.
p14722
aVIt occurred to her vaguely that it was a happiness she could\u000ascarcely have anticipated not to have Dolff on her hands, who was almost\u000aalways waiting for the opportunity of falling upon her.
p14723
aVBut she had\u000ascarcely seen Dolff all day.
p14724
aVIf ever man spent a miserable day it was Dolff upon this occasion, when\u000aall his faculties were roused to watch the girl whom he had thought so\u000aperfect.
p14725
aVPoor boy, his mind was full of the most dolorous conflict.
p14726
aVHe\u000awas angry, jealous, wretched, longing to go down on his knees to ask her\u000awhat the letter meant, to implore her to tell him that it was all right\u000aand there was no harm in it, yet not daring to betray that he knew\u000aanything at all, or that he had any suspicions, and all the time\u000adeclaring to himself that he was a brute to suspect her that could do no\u000awrong.
p14727
aVIf she was wronging anyone it was not him, to whom she had never\u000agiven any hearing, but Gussy.
p14728
aVAnd Dolff\u2019s mind waxed fierce at the\u000athought of the other, the man who was Gussy\u2019s lover, yet had dared to\u000awrite to Janet.
p14729
aVSometimes it gleamed upon him that there might be\u000anothing wrong in Meredith\u2019s letter to Janet, that it might be some\u000aquestion, something of no importance: but it was very hard for him to\u000abelieve that there was nothing in it, and the desire in Dolff\u2019s heart\u000awas to take the fellow by the throat, to knock him down, to kick him, to\u000aannihilate him.
p14730
aVIt was his fault.
p14731
aVIf Janet was in the wrong, it was he\u000athat had beguiled her and led her away.
p14732
aV\u201cLet me but get my hands on the fellow!\u201d Dolff said.
p14733
aVHe kept up a very rigorous watch all day, and when in the afternoon he\u000asaw Janet steal forth alone, Dolff followed in the growing darkness,\u000adetermined to see where she went.
p14734
aVHe kept her in sight along the line\u000aof garden walls to the little shop, such an innocent, feminine shop, and\u000ahis heart was relieved at the sight of it.
p14735
aVSurely there could be no harm\u000athere!
p14736
aVDolff thought at first of following her in, his heart swelling with\u000asudden relief.
p14737
aVHe would go in and ask leave to walk home with her, and\u000aforget all his evil thoughts.
p14738
aVBut as he passed the pretty shop-window,\u000awith all its Christmas cards laid out, and paused to look in for the\u000apleasure of seeing her trim little figure with the big boa, looking, as\u000ahe thought, like no one else he had ever seen before, distinguishable\u000aanywhere at any distance, something else struck his eye--a black coat,\u000aan uncovered head, a greeting, even the sound of the voices coming to\u000ahim, recognizable, though he did not hear what they said.
p14739
aVIt was to\u000aarrange a meeting that the letter had come.
p14740
aVDolff\u2019s heart swelled as if\u000ait would burst from his breast; the veins in his temple began to beat.
p14741
aVThe traitor!
p14742
aVThe false wretch--false to Gussy, false to everybody,\u000adisgracing and betraying the house in which he had been received!
p14743
aVDolff\u2019s passion ran in his veins like wine.
p14744
aVHe was drunk with the\u000aimpulse of vengeance that came upon him.
p14745
aVIf he could but seize the\u000afellow by the throat, dash out his brains against the stones, he thought\u000ahe would be happy.
p14746
aVHe could not have spoken; he could scarcely breathe.
p14747
aVPoor Gussy betrayed!
p14748
aVAnd this--this little deceiver---- He stopped\u000ahimself with a gasp in his throat.
p14749
aVIt could not be her fault--it was the\u000avillain\u2019s fault--the intolerable wretch who deserved no mercy.
p14750
aV_She_ was\u000ahis victim, too.
p14751
aVDolff stood with eyes of fire gazing at them through\u000athe trumpery little veil of painted papers, the Christmas cards and\u000apictures that were stuck all over the window, taking hold of himself, so\u000ato speak, with both hands to keep his fury down.
p14752
aVAfter all, it occurred\u000ato him, almost with a sense of disappointment, this might, it was\u000apossible, be a chance meeting.
p14753
aVHe must do nothing rashly.
p14754
aVHe must not\u000astrike till he knew.
p14755
aVHe stood and watched the conversation; how he\u000asmiled and advanced, and Janet looked up shyly with at first reluctant\u000alooks, withdrawing a little.
p14756
aVNo, she was unwilling, she drew back.
p14757
aVGod\u000abless her!
p14758
aVShe did not, indeed, look up at all at first, only after a\u000atime, when he had flattered and cajoled her, the villain.
p14759
aVNo, she had\u000anot meant it, poor darling, he had been lying in wait for her.
p14760
aVIt was\u000anot she, not she, that was to blame!
p14761
aVDolff followed every movement with blazing eyes; he pulled up the collar\u000aof his coat, and held his hat down over his brows, that they might not\u000aby any chance see and recognize him.
p14762
aVNow they were coming out together.
p14763
aVHe turned half away with his shoulder to the pair, but his ears\u000adrinking in every sound, and Meredith did not seem afraid of being\u000aheard.
p14764
aV\u201cYou were a little angel to come,\u201d he said, as he came down the steps.
p14765
aV\u201cI half fancied you would take fright.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was a settled thing; an arranged meeting.
p14766
aVDolff was almost glad,\u000athough with a sense of anguish in his heart.
p14767
aVHe had his arm thrown out\u000ato strike, when with the impulse of rage and jealousy which prefers to\u000afeed its flame, to hear a little more of the depravity it means to\u000apunish, he restrained himself once more and followed.
p14768
aVHow it was they\u000adid not hear him following almost in their footsteps close behind them\u000ahe could never tell.
p14769
aVThey were entirely absorbed in each other.
p14770
aVMeredith\u000atook that hand which Dolff scarcely dared to touch, and drew it\u000afamiliarly within his arm.
p14771
aV\u201cIt is dark, nobody will see us,\u201d said the well-known voice.
p14772
aV\u201cJust for\u000athis once.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat did he mean by his \u201cjust for this once,\u201d the shameless villain?
p14773
aVIf\u000ait was for once, should it not be forever?
p14774
aVDolff strode on behind close\u000aas their shadow; it was quite dark, and the few lamps in St. John\u2019s Wood\u000agave a very moderate light.
p14775
aVThey did not see him, they were too much\u000aabsorbed in each other.
p14776
aVBut he could no longer make out what they said.
p14777
aVMeredith was discoursing upon something which Janet did not seem to\u000aunderstand any more than Dolff did; but when he stooped down over her,\u000aholding the hand which was upon his arm in his, and said, \u201cMy little\u000aJanet,\u201d both Janet and Dolff, with his supernatural hearing, understood\u000avery well.
p14778
aVThus they came in their temerity, trusting to the darkness\u000aand to the loneliness of the deserted, silent streets, close to Mrs.\u000aHarwood\u2019s door.
p14779
aVCHAPTER XXXII.
p14780
aVDolff blotted himself out against the wall, under the tree which bent\u000aover the wall of his own garden, and threw a rugged shadow on the\u000apavement.
p14781
aVHe was invisible in the gloom of the wintry night.
p14782
aVThey went\u000aup in their boldness almost to the very door, and stood there\u000awhispering, yet starting at every noise.
p14783
aVDolff could scarcely hear\u000aJanet\u2019s hesitating little voice, but he drank in every sound of\u000aMeredith\u2019s.
p14784
aV\u201cNo, no; there will be nobody out at this hour.
p14785
aVDon\u2019t be afraid.
p14786
aVAh!
p14787
aVthere might be Dolff.
p14788
aVNo; Dolff\u2019s waiting for you to come in to teach\u000ahim his new song, Janet.
p14789
aVLittle daring!
p14790
aVto train a lout like that.
p14791
aVWell, you\u2019ll keep your eyes open, and if you hear or see anything\u000afurther, report to me at once.
p14792
aVIt\u2019s very important.
p14793
aVWhat do you say?
p14794
aVDon\u2019t be in such a fright, dearest; nobody will see us.\u201d\u000a\u000aThen there came a murmur from Janet, too low to be heard.
p14795
aV\u201cYes, there you\u2019re right.
p14796
aVThere might be Vicars, the everlasting Vicars\u000awhose occupation will be gone, and who will have to return to be a\u000abutler, like the others.
p14797
aVOh, no, I\u2019ve no pity for Vicars.
p14798
aVI daresay it\u000awas he who put his mistress up to it.
p14799
aVMind you keep a good look-out.
p14800
aVYou\u000adon\u2019t know how important it may be for me.
p14801
aVYes, I know I must go.
p14802
aVIt\u000awill be droll after this, won\u2019t it, to meet solemnly, as if we had not\u000aseen each other for ages, and didn\u2019t care if we never met again?
p14803
aVEh?
p14804
aVTo\u000abe sure, I\u2019m going to dinner, and you are never seen on those occasions.
p14805
aVPoor little Janet, eating her morsel up in the nursery, like a naughty\u000achild, and knowing there\u2019s some one downstairs.
p14806
aVNever mind, I shall only\u000athink of you the more.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd make fun of me with her?\u201d said Janet, in a sharper, more audible\u000atone.
p14807
aV\u201cWith Gussy, bless her!
p14808
aVNo, she never lets me make fun.
p14809
aVShe don\u2019t\u000aunderstand it.
p14810
aVYou needn\u2019t be jealous, little one, though I avow it\u2019s\u000adroll enough, the position altogether: to keep her in good humor--and\u000athen you, you little spitfire.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet was not audible but in the movement of her figure, the twist of\u000aher shoulders, the poise of her head, there was a question and\u000aremonstrance as clear as words.
p14811
aV\u201cWhy do I do it?
p14812
aVOh, it\u2019s all very complicated, very difficult to\u000aunderstand.
p14813
aVI couldn\u2019t explain unless I had time.
p14814
aVUnfair!
p14815
aVno; there\u2019s\u000anothing unfair, don\u2019t you know, in love or in war.
p14816
aVDon\u2019t be afraid;\u000ashe\u2019s of the careless kind, it will do her no harm.
p14817
aVI ought not?
p14818
aVWell,\u000aperhaps not, strictly speaking.
p14819
aVBut when does one do everything one\u000aought?
p14820
aVThis is not right--perhaps not; but it\u2019s all the more sweet, eh,\u000alittle one?
p14821
aVAnd as for Gussy!\u201d he laughed, that triumphant laugh which,\u000aeven to Janet\u2019s bewildered ears, was not without offence, \u201cfor\u000aGussy----\u201d with a gurgle of mirth in the words.
p14822
aVJanet could never understand how that horrible moment went, nor how it\u000aall happened.
p14823
aVSomething seemed suddenly to hurtle through the air, a\u000adark, swift, rapid thing, like a thunderbolt.
p14824
aVShe had scarcely felt the\u000asensation of being pushed away when she was conscious of Meredith lying\u000aat her feet, his white face upturned to the faint light, and of that\u000adark thing over him seizing him, dashing his head against the pavement.
p14825
aVJanet uttered a cry, but it was not her cry that brought flying feet\u000aalong the road in both directions, and evoked a little tumult round the\u000ainsensible figure.
p14826
aVShe mingled with it instinctively; she could not tell\u000awhy, keeping silent, partly that she was struck dumb with terror, partly\u000awith an instinct of self-preservation, which seized her in this strange,\u000asudden, awful emergency.
p14827
aVWhen the door was opened--and her senses were\u000aso acute that she saw it was Vicars who had rushed to see what the\u000acommotion was--she managed to steal in unseen, to fly upstairs, and\u000ashelter herself in her room.
p14828
aVWhat did it matter where she went?
p14829
aVHe had\u000abeen killed before her eyes, with the laugh on his lips.
p14830
aVKilled--struck\u000adead at a blow!
p14831
aVAnd she had seen it done, and knew who had done it, and\u000awas all mixed up and involved in the horrible, horrible catastrophe.
p14832
aVIt\u000amay seem cruel that this was Janet\u2019s first thought, but she was so\u000ayoung.
p14833
aVShe had done her share of all this wrong so carelessly, with no\u000aparticular meaning, thinking not much harm.
p14834
aV\u201cNot much harm,\u201d she said to herself, piteously.
p14835
aVNo harm, no harm--only to amuse herself; and lo!
p14836
aVit had come to murder,\u000ato sudden, swift fate.
p14837
aVShe was all one throb from head to foot, of\u000ahorror and panic and wild excitement.
p14838
aVHad any one seen her?
p14839
aVWould she be\u000amixed up in it?
p14840
aVWould she have to stand forward and avow it all before\u000athe world in the light of day!
p14841
aVOh, what could Janet do?
p14842
aVWhere could she\u000afly?
p14843
aVHow escape the dreadful revelation, the story which would be spread\u000aover all the world, the horrible fact of being mixed up in a murder?
p14844
aVFor\u000athe second time, when he seized Meredith by the shoulders, and dashed\u000ahis head against the stones, she had recognized Dolff\u2019s face, distorted,\u000aalmost beyond recognition, by passion.
p14845
aVWhat could be more dreadful than\u000ato be the witness of it all, the only one who could tell--mixed up in it\u000aas no one else in the world could be?
p14846
aVBy and by she heard sounds of men tramping, and a great commotion below.
p14847
aVThey were bringing him in here--him--it--the body.
p14848
aVJanet\u2019s head went\u000around, she was on the verge of fainting, but called back her senses by a\u000asupreme effort, saying to herself that if she were found fainting she\u000awould be betrayed, and that nothing but her own self-possession and\u000acourage could now save her.
p14849
aVShe dipped her head into a basin of water,\u000aput off her outdoor things, even her shoes, on which there were signs of\u000aher walk, and stole out to the gallery to look over the banisters.
p14850
aVShe\u000awas pale, and there was horror in her face, but that was no more than\u000athe circumstances called forth.
p14851
aVHe was lying on a couch which had been wheeled into the hall, and round\u000ahim there was a little crowd, a doctor, who seemed to have sprung out of\u000athe earth, as everybody did, and who stood over the prostrate figure\u000aexamining it.
p14852
aVWhat was the use?
p14853
aVJanet could scarcely keep herself from\u000acrying out, when she had seen him killed.
p14854
aVKilled!
p14855
aVOh, what was the use?
p14856
aVGussy, very pale, but with all her wits about her, stood at the foot of\u000athe sofa.
p14857
aVThere was a policeman in the hall, and an eager crowd filling\u000aup the doorway with a ring of staring heads.
p14858
aVAnd there he lay killed,\u000akilled!
p14859
aVAnd Janet, horror-stricken, speechless, mixed up in it!
p14860
aVthe only\u000awitness of what had been done.
p14861
aVThat dreadful instinct of\u000aself-preservation presently impelled her to further steps; that and the\u000aanxiety she felt to know everything, to know especially how far it was\u000aknown that she was mixed up in it.
p14862
aV\u201cWhat is it?
p14863
aVwhat is it?\u201d she whispered to Gussy, feeling herself by\u000aMiss Harwood\u2019s side; \u201cis it an accident?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe can\u2019t tell what it is: it is Mr. Meredith,\u201d said Gussy, in a low,\u000astern tone.
p14864
aVJanet uttered a cry--what more natural?--and, stealing one glance at the\u000awhite upturned face, hid her own in her hands.
p14865
aVIt was only what an\u000ainexperienced girl would naturally do brought suddenly into such a\u000apresence.
p14866
aVNobody noticed her or thought of her.
p14867
aVIn the dark she had\u000aescaped entirely unseen.
p14868
aVThen there stole a little balm into her despairing soul.
p14869
aVThe doctor,\u000aafter a hurried examination, turned round to say that the man was still\u000aalive, and begged that a well-known surgeon in the neighborhood should\u000abe immediately sent for.
p14870
aVGussy, who was very pale but perfectly calm,\u000aand complete mistress of the situation, herself superintended the\u000aremoval of the couch into the dining-room, which was spacious and well\u000aaired, and had everything removed which was out of place.
p14871
aVThe table was already spread for the dinner at which Meredith was to\u000ahave been one of the chief guests and Dolff to have occupied the place\u000aof master of the house.
p14872
aVFortunately Gussy did not as yet know the double\u000amisery involved.
p14873
aVIt was dreadful enough to have this calamity fall so\u000asuddenly without warning upon the domestic happiness and calm.
p14874
aVThe\u000adinner-table, with all its pretty arrangements of flowers and shining\u000acrystal and plate, was such a mockery of the sudden, unexplained,\u000aincomprehensible catastrophe, that this touch of the familiar and\u000acommonplace almost broke down Gussy\u2019s composure.
p14875
aVShe dismantled it\u000anoiselessly with her own hands, assisted eagerly, as she remembered\u000aafterwards with compunction and gratitude, by Janet, who clung closely\u000ato her like her shadow, following where she went with an anxious\u000aendeavor to be of use, which went to Gussy\u2019s heart.
p14876
aVThey removed the\u000aincongruous ornaments in less time than half-a-dozen housemaids would\u000ahave done, and pushed the table aside.
p14877
aVWhen the surgeon arrived, Janet was ready to be sent on any errand, and\u000adid everything with noiseless rapidity, looking not at the figure on the\u000asofa, which she seemed incapable of regarding, but at Gussy for her\u000aorders.
p14878
aVShe was like an obedient, docile slave.
p14879
aVWhen the ladies were\u000asent out of the room she still clung to Miss Harwood like her shadow,\u000amoving only when she moved.
p14880
aVIn the hall the policeman still held his\u000aplace, with several of the people who had surged in after him and who\u000awere giving their several accounts of the transaction.
p14881
aV\u201cI see it all,\u201d said one.
p14882
aV\u201cI was on the other side of the road, and I\u000asee it all.
p14883
aVThere was a woman with the poor gentleman.
p14884
aVI can\u2019t tell you\u000awhat kind of a woman; not much good, I shouldn\u2019t think--or perhaps she\u000awas a-begging.
p14885
aVThere wasn\u2019t light enough to see.
p14886
aVAnd all in a moment\u000asome one made a spring upon him.
p14887
aVI don\u2019t know where he came from,\u000aofficer.
p14888
aVI see him dash on the gentleman as if he had fallen out of the\u000asky.
p14889
aVAnd down he went like a nine-pin, and afore I could get across the\u000aroad the other lifts him up again and down with his head upon the\u000aground.\u201d\u000a\u000aGussy was standing by, listening intently, and Janet behind, half-hidden\u000ain her shadow, listening too, with such wild yet paralyzing sensation,\u000awondering would he know her if he saw her--this man who had seen it\u000aall--shrinking behind her protectress faint and sick with the unreality,\u000athe fact and falsehood mingled in which her feet were caught.
p14890
aVGussy\u2019s voice so close to her even made her start, \u201cHave they got the\u000aman?
p14891
aVIs he known?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe witness turned to her with an instinctive transfer of his attention.
p14892
aV\u201cHe just disappeared, mum, as he came.
p14893
aVAfore I could come up to them he\u000awas gone.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI saw a man running round the corner,\u201d said another, \u201cbut I took no\u000anotice, for I didn\u2019t know then what was up.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, miss,\u201d said another, \u201cthe fellow\u2019s in your garden\u000aif he\u2019s anywhere.
p14894
aVI see some one dart in when your man-servant came out.
p14895
aVI\u2019ll take my oath he did.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn our garden!
p14896
aVHas there been any search?
p14897
aVHave you done anything to\u000asecure the man?
p14898
aVCan anyone identify him?
p14899
aVWhat are you standing there\u000afor,\u201d cried Gussy, \u201cdoing nothing, if that wretch is within reach?
p14900
aVPoliceman----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m a-looking after the murdered man, miss,\u201d said the policeman.
p14901
aV\u201cI did\u000asound my rattle, and there\u2019s two of my mates about.
p14902
aVI shouldn\u2019t say but\u000ait might be a good chance to search the garden, unless they\u2019ve got him\u000aoutside.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGo then, go, for heaven\u2019s sake, and do it,\u201d cried Gussy.
p14903
aV\u201cHe may have\u000aescaped by this time.
p14904
aVMr. Meredith\u2019s friends will give a reward.
p14905
aVI\u000amyself--\u201d she suddenly faltered and grew pale, leaning back upon Janet\u000afor support.
p14906
aV\u201cGo, go,\u201d she cried, faintly, \u201cgo and find the murderer.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet had to put her arms round her to support her.
p14907
aVOh, what things were\u000abeating in the breast that afforded that support.
p14908
aVThe murderer!
p14909
aVwas not\u000ashe too the murderer?
p14910
aVshe, whom no one would recognize, who would never\u000abe punished, save by the consciousness which would be her inheritance\u000aforever.
p14911
aVHorror and trouble, and the dreadful fear of betraying herself,\u000aof being mixed up in it, kept Janet upright as if in a frame of iron.
p14912
aVThe murderer!
p14913
aVOh, heaven!
p14914
aVif they should find him, and if he should\u000apoint her out and let all the world know how deeply she was mixed up in\u000ait!
p14915
aVShe supported Gussy, yet clung to her, looking with eyes of anguish\u000aat the policeman who got out his lantern and prepared to go.
p14916
aV\u201cI think Mr. Harwood is in the garden,\u201d she said, \u201che was--walking\u000athere--a little while ago.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDolff!\u201d said Gussy, recovering herself; then she added, \u201cI hear my\u000abrother is in the garden; he will help you.
p14917
aVOh, do not lose any more\u000atime; go!
p14918
aVgo!\u201d\u000a\u000aWas it to save Dolff that Janet said this, or to betray him?
p14919
aVOh, not to\u000abetray him certainly, for that would be to betray herself.
p14920
aVIt seemed to\u000aher that the sight of him would kill her; yet could she but warn him by\u000aa word--only a word!
p14921
aVIf he had the presence of mind to be calm, to make\u000athat rabble understand that he was the son of the house.
p14922
aVHer heart sank within her as they trooped out into the dark garden; the\u000apoliceman with his lantern, a few of the boldest of the men following\u000ahim, the rest hanging about in the front of the house talking over this\u000awonderful adventure, which was so terrible, an unthinking, unoffending\u000aman struck down in a moment; but a godsend to all the idle loiterers who\u000aspring out of the earth whenever such an excitement is to be had.
p14923
aVThe hall was cleared of all the intruders that pushed into it; the\u000aservants who had been hanging about retired; Gussy went into the\u000adrawing-room to carry the dreadful news to her mother: and Janet, who\u000acould not rest, to whom some outlet for her overwhelming excitement was\u000anecessary, went out into the porch, and, raising her voice, told the\u000aspectators to go away.
p14924
aV\u201cDon\u2019t you see that the noise you make will do harm?\u201d she cried.
p14925
aV\u201cIt may\u000ahurt the--the poor gentleman who is--so ill.
p14926
aVIt will warn the--the man\u000awho did it if he should be here.
p14927
aVOh, go away, go away, for God\u2019s sake.
p14928
aVWhat do you want here?
p14929
aVGo away!
p14930
aVoh, go away!\u201d\u000a\u000aShe went out in her excitement, moving them towards the garden door,\u000awhich still stood open, haunted by some mere lookers-on to whom the news\u000ahad been carried by the extraordinary rapidity of rumor, which would\u000acall forth a crowd in the midst of a desert.
p14931
aVThough she was so slight\u000aand young, so little able to influence them, yet they yielded before\u000aher, moving out, indistinguishable in the darkness, obeying the natural\u000aright of a member of the household to clear its precincts, though with a\u000alittle grumbling and remonstrance.
p14932
aV\u201cWe want to get hold on the murderer.\u201d \u201cWe want to see as he doesn\u2019t\u000aescape.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s far enough off by this,\u201d cried a sceptic.
p14933
aV\u201cThe police get\u000ahold on a fellow like that!
p14934
aVnot as I ever heard tell on.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, go away, go away,\u201d cried Janet, following them to the door.
p14935
aVShe pushed it close after them, shutting it with a sharp snap, comforted\u000aa little to have got rid of so many at least; but not, it seemed of all.
p14936
aVAs she turned back some one caught her by the arm.
p14937
aVAll Janet\u2019s\u000acomposure, her courage, her over-mastering resolution not to betray\u000aherself, could not withstand this new shock.
p14938
aVShe gave a cry.
p14939
aVIt seemed\u000ato her in her dreadful agitation as if the next thing would be that some\u000aone would thunder, \u201cYou are the woman who was with him\u201d in her ear.
p14940
aVIt seemed almost tame to her that the tragic whisper she heard, hoarse\u000aand miserable, emphasized by another crushing pressure of her arm, was\u000a\u201cIs he dead?
p14941
aVIs he dead?\u201d and no more.
p14942
aVCHAPTER XXXIII.
p14943
aVThere is nothing in the world that so suddenly sobers wild excitement\u000aand passion as to carry out its practical suggestions.
p14944
aVA blow brings\u000adown the pulses of wrath as nothing else can do.
p14945
aVIt is a dangerous\u000aremedy, but it is a sure one.
p14946
aVDolff was like a devil incarnate as he swooped down upon his victim and\u000abeat his head against the stones.
p14947
aVThe moment he had done it--the moment\u000ahe had done it, he became a horrified, miserable, remorseful boy,\u000amiserable beyond any words to describe.
p14948
aVAs soon as he heard that dull\u000athud on the pavement, and saw the white face turn unconscious in a\u000ablank which he never doubted to be that of death, his own being came\u000aback to him.
p14949
aVHis passion ended like the blowing out of a candle.
p14950
aVWhat\u000ahad he done?
p14951
aVWhat had he done?
p14952
aVInstinctively he sprang back under the\u000ashadow of the tree and the wall; but he had no thought of escape, or of\u000aanything but the dreadful thing he had done.
p14953
aVAfter a minute, when other\u000apeople crowded round the prostrate figure, he stole among the crowd and\u000aentered with them, pushing like the rest through the narrow doorway, as\u000aif he, too, were a spectator, to know all that happened.
p14954
aVAfter the first\u000aawful sobering and coming to himself, there came over him a passion of\u000aeagerness and curiosity--a desire to know which for the moment made him\u000afeel himself a spectator, too.
p14955
aVHe even asked the other lads who crowded\u000ain along with him what it was, what had happened, and heard half-a-dozen\u000aversions of his own deed as he shouldered his way on to get a place near\u000athe door, with a strange feeling of being cut off from the house and all\u000ain it, of being but a wretched spectator and inquirer, though with that\u000amisery in his veins like molten fire.
p14956
aVWhat was to hinder him pushing his\u000away among them, going in boldly, he whom nobody could suspect, the son\u000aof the house, to see what was the matter?
p14957
aVBut Dolff could not do it.
p14958
aVJanet had been stronger of mind than he.
p14959
aVShe had managed to disengage\u000aherself at once from the tumult, to steal in while attention was\u000adiverted from her, to escape in the darkness and confusion.
p14960
aVAnd so might\u000ahe have done: but he was incapable of thinking of himself or his own\u000asafety, though instinct made him herd among the intruders, concealing\u000ahimself in the crowd.
p14961
aVWhat he wanted to see was what had happened,\u000awhether it was real, and the man killed, or if it were only, as he\u000aalmost hoped, a dreadful dream.
p14962
aVHe heard it said that the gentleman was\u000anot dead, but it conveyed no impression to his mind, and he pushed\u000aforward, peering over the shoulders of the others who crowded and gazed\u000aat the unknown interior, with a horrible sense of familiarity yet\u000adistance.
p14963
aVThere was the couch wheeled out of the library, the couch on\u000awhich he had himself lounged so often; there was Gussy, clasping her\u000ahands together as if to keep herself up, standing as pale as death by\u000athe foot of the couch; there was--heaven!
p14964
aVwas it Janet standing behind,\u000ahalf concealing herself in the other\u2019s shadow?
p14965
aVIt was not Janet then, he\u000asaid in his dull brain--not Janet that was the cause of it all, only\u000asome horrible delusion to tempt him to his fate.
p14966
aVThere had been nothing\u000awrong except in him.
p14967
aVHe it was alone who had been to blame.
p14968
aVShe could\u000anot have been there at all, since, she was here, horrified, full of\u000apity, helping, when he had killed.
p14969
aVOh, God!
p14970
aVwhat had he done?
p14971
aVHe had\u000akilled a man in some horrible mistake.
p14972
aVPerhaps it was not Meredith at\u000aall; if it was, it was his friend, Gussy\u2019s betrothed, the friend of the\u000afamily.
p14973
aVHe had killed him--for what, for what?
p14974
aVFor nothing.
p14975
aVHis rage had\u000adied off like fever.
p14976
aVHe was quite calm now, like one fallen from some\u000ahorrible height, shaking with the shock, and as miserable as if all the\u000amiseries of earth had gathered on his head.
p14977
aVIt did not seem to him\u000aunnatural that he should stand there among the crowd, struggling to get\u000aa glimpse of what was going on in his own home, within his mother\u2019s open\u000adoor.
p14978
aVHe did not, however, follow the others when Janet drove them away.
p14979
aVThough it had filled him with consternation to see her there, and the\u000adull, dreadful thought that there had been no provocation, nothing but\u000adelusion and mistake--it was yet with a kind of stupid fury and\u000arepugnance that he saw her taking upon her to send away the crowd, to\u000aact as if the house was hers.
p14980
aVHe hung behind in the dark, and seized her\u000aarm with a wild feeling that he would like to crush her too to make her\u000afeel, though apparently she had done no wrong.
p14981
aVBut these gave way to the\u000aother anxiety, the deeper interest.
p14982
aVAfter all there was but one thing\u000athat it was, or would be, now or ever, of the slightest importance to\u000aknow--was he dead?
p14983
aVJanet gave no direct answer to his question.
p14984
aVShe said quickly,\u000a\u000a\u201cCome in now, take your place, and nobody will ever suspect.
p14985
aVIt is all\u000ain your own hands.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe did not understand what she meant.
p14986
aVSuspect?
p14987
aVWhat did it matter?
p14988
aVThere\u000awas only one thing of consequence--was he dead?
p14989
aV\u201cNo,\u201d said Janet.
p14990
aV\u201cNo, no, no; do you understand!
p14991
aVGo in, and say you\u000awere in the garden.
p14992
aVOh, do you hear me?
p14993
aVThe men are coming round again.
p14994
aVCome in, and look as if--as if you were yourself.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs if he were himself!
p14995
aVHe did not understand.
p14996
aVHe was not himself.
p14997
aVHe did\u000anot know who he was.
p14998
aVHe had nothing to do in that house.
p14999
aVHe stood and\u000astared blankly at her, not knowing what she meant.
p15000
aVBut Janet was as keen\u000aas he was dull.
p15001
aVA passion of energy, of life, and purpose was in her.
p15002
aVHis hand had dropped from her arm, but she seized him with both hers,\u000aand dragged him into the house.
p15003
aVShe flew at him as if she meant to\u000aassault him, putting down the collar of his coat, pulling off his cap,\u000athrusting a hat into his hand--a few hours since how those touches, this\u000afamiliarity, would have moved them both.
p15004
aVShe did it all now like a\u000anurse dressing a child, while he stood stupid, not resisting.
p15005
aV\u201cSay you have just come in, and ask what has happened.
p15006
aVFor God\u2019s sake\u000adon\u2019t mix them all up in it, and kill your mother.
p15007
aVNobody will ever\u000asuspect--ah!\u201d Janet saw through the open door the advancing gleam of the\u000apoliceman\u2019s lantern.
p15008
aVShe left him with a little shake to rouse him to\u000aenergy, and ran forward to meet the constable.
p15009
aV\u201cHave you found the man?
p15010
aVHave you found anyone?
p15011
aVOh, here is Mr. Harwood, just come in; you can\u000aspeak to him.
p15012
aVHe doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happened.
p15013
aVI was trying to tell him.
p15014
aVCome in,\u201d she said, \u201cpoliceman; but don\u2019t let all those people come in.
p15015
aVCome in and talk to Mr. Harwood; but shut the door.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe policeman came in heavily, putting down his lantern on the floor.
p15016
aV\u201cWe\u2019ve found nothing, miss, and I didn\u2019t expect as we should.
p15017
aVIt was my\u000amate\u2019s business to see as no one escaped while I saw after the\u000agentleman; but he\u2019s got clear off, as they always do, along of men not\u000aminding their own business.
p15018
aVEvening, sir.
p15019
aVIt\u2019s a dreadful business, this\u000ais, to happen just at a gentleman\u2019s door, and a friend of the family, as\u000athey tell me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have just come in,\u201d said Dolff, saying his lesson stupidly.
p15020
aVAnd then\u000ahe added the only question that had any interest for him: \u201cHe\u2019s not\u000adead?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot at present,\u201d said the policeman; \u201cbut the doctors say as they can\u2019t\u000atell what an hour or two may bring forth.\u201d He spoke hopefully, as of a\u000afavorable turn the case might take.
p15021
aV\u201cIt\u2019s a deal of trouble for you,\u000asir, and the ladies, to have such a thing as this happen, as I was\u000aa-saying, at your very door.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s very well, though,\u201d said Janet, \u201cfor the poor gentleman to be so\u000anear a friend\u2019s house.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet felt that the safety of this house, which she had perhaps betrayed\u000aotherwise, but in which her own safety now lay, demanded all her\u000aexertions.
p15022
aVDespair had given her force.
p15023
aVShe was beginning to recover her\u000acolor in the stimulation of this dreadful emergency.
p15024
aV\u201cThat\u2019s one way of looking at it, miss,\u201d said the policeman.
p15025
aV\u201cMy mates\u000athey are busy a-hearing all the nonsense that them fellows can tell\u000athem.
p15026
aVI don\u2019t believe they knows anything about it, for my part.
p15027
aVI\u2019ll\u000ajust wait here, sir, if I may, with leave, till I hears the doctor\u2019s\u000alast report.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMr.
p15028
aVHarwood is just going in, and he\u2019ll bring it to you,\u201d said Janet.
p15029
aVShe dared not say any more, but she pointed towards the dining-room door\u000awith an imperative movement.
p15030
aVIt was fortunate for Dolff that, at this\u000amoment, his sister appeared.
p15031
aVShe came quickly into the hall, with an\u000aexclamation of satisfaction.
p15032
aV\u201cOh, Dolff, you are here!
p15033
aVI am thankful you are here.
p15034
aVHave they got the\u000aman?
p15035
aVI have told them there will be a reward----\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff could say nothing to his sister.
p15036
aVHis tongue clave to the roof of\u000ahis mouth.
p15037
aVHe repeated as he had done before, with a dull reiteration.
p15038
aV\u201cIs he dead?
p15039
aVHe is not dead?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, no, no, no, God be praised!
p15040
aVThat\u2019s the chief thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u000a\u000aGussy went up to her brother and twined her arm within his and, leaning\u000aupon his shoulder, cried a little, with faint sobs.
p15041
aVShe was not a\u000ademonstrative person, and the movement took him entirely by surprise.
p15042
aVHe\u000astood with his hands in his pockets, dully supporting her, saying\u000anothing, his mouth open and jaw dropped.
p15043
aVThere was no power of tragic\u000aexpression in Dolff\u2019s commonplace countenance; but there was a dumb sort\u000aof quiescent misery in it.
p15044
aVHe was capable of nothing, not even of a word\u000ato shield himself.
p15045
aVBut then there was no one there who suspected\u000ahim--only Janet, who knew, and whose interest it was to protect him--to\u000asilence all possibility of suspicion.
p15046
aVShe stood looking on, conscious of\u000athe respectful sympathy of the policeman with the brother and sister,\u000aand feeling a new and fierce impulse of hatred rising in her heart\u000atowards the young man whom she was exerting herself so strenuously to\u000asave.
p15047
aVIn the midst of these efforts there came into her mind so strong an\u000aimpulse to denounce him that Janet was afraid of herself.
p15048
aVEven while she\u000awas scheming how best to divert all suspicion the voice seemed to\u000astruggle up in her almost audibly--\u201cTake him!
p15049
aVtake him.
p15050
aVThat is the\u000aman!\u201d How could she be sure that she would not yield to it at some\u000amoment when the sight of him had driven her frantic with indignation and\u000aimpatience?
p15051
aVThat Gussy should seek his sympathy; that everybody should\u000alook to Dolff to direct the search; that the very constable--and all the\u000atime he was the man--he was the man!
p15052
aVA spasmodic shiver ran through Janet; she could hardly keep silent, and\u000ayet her mind was busy inventing devices to protect him.
p15053
aVShe stood there\u000alonging to fly from them all--to be alone, and able to relax her\u000aself-bondage.
p15054
aVBut Janet felt that she dared not go away.
p15055
aVHe might betray\u000ahimself--or worse, and more likely still--he might betray her.
p15056
aVHe might\u000atell Gussy what share she had in the matter.
p15057
aVIt was what men did--to\u000apunish a woman, regardless what trouble might fall upon themselves.
p15058
aVShe\u000astood with her hands firmly clasped, like a sentinel on guard.
p15059
aVThis dreadful evening, however, came to an end, as all evenings do.
p15060
aVThe\u000acrowd was made to pass on, to leave the house in quiet, though there\u000awere still an unusual number of passengers and people loitering about\u000atill far on in the night, notwithstanding the policeman who was on duty\u000anear to keep them unmolested.
p15061
aVAnd within all became quiet, except in so\u000afar as dangerous illness in a house disturbs its habitual repose.
p15062
aVA\u000anurse had been installed in the room in which Meredith lay, and Gussy\u000acame and went throughout the night, holding occasional whispered\u000aconferences in the hall with the doctor, who remained too.
p15063
aVThe patient still lay insensible, entirely unconscious of what had\u000ahappened to him, with that utterly mournful and pathetic look which a\u000aface that is unconscious takes.
p15064
aVHe had concussion of the brain, as well\u000aas external injuries of a serious description, but it was as yet\u000aimpossible to pronounce whether he would die, or if he might yet\u000arecover.
p15065
aVTwo of the servants were up in case anything might be wanted\u000aduring the night, a quite unnecessary precaution--one of the results of\u000athe great and unusual excitement which had convulsed the house--but\u000aexcept these women, who appeared now and then at the end of the passage\u000awhich led to the kitchen, very sleepy and with an air of conscious\u000aself-sacrifice on their faces, no one else was suffered to be about.
p15066
aVJanet had asked to stay to be of use, but had been dismissed by Miss\u000aHarwood--not unkindly.
p15067
aV\u201cIt\u2019s not that I am not grateful, Janet.
p15068
aVYou stood by me this evening in\u000aa way which I shall not forget; but you\u2019re too young,\u201d said Gussy, with\u000aa sigh, \u201cto sit up, unless it was a case in which your heart was\u000aconcerned.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis speech of his sister\u2019s for the first time roused Dolff a little.
p15069
aVHe\u000ahad been sitting all the evening with a stupefied air, saying nothing,\u000acalling forth much sympathy and admiration from his mother, who\u000awhispered to Janet how tender-hearted he was, how much he felt it.
p15070
aVBut\u000aGussy\u2019s words roused him.
p15071
aVHe glanced at Janet, as Janet had glanced at\u000ahim with the same impulse, to say, \u201cShe\u2019s the cause of it all,\u201d as she\u000ahad felt to say, \u201cThat is the man.\u201d\u000a\u000aTheir eyes met, and they both read what was in the other\u2019s looks; a\u000acertain fear, yet defiance, awoke between them.
p15072
aVThey were in each\u000aother\u2019s power.
p15073
aVJanet had Dolff\u2019s life in her hands, and he had her\u000areputation in his.
p15074
aVThey were both liable to all the risks of a sudden\u000aimpulse, to let the truth slip in a moment of provocation.
p15075
aVJanet watched the hardening and darkening of the face which had once\u000aexpressed only devotion and admiration, with a sinking of her heart.
p15076
aVHe\u000awas more dangerous to her than she was to him.
p15077
aVIt was evident that to\u000asee his sister\u2019s trust in her was more than he could bear.
p15078
aVAfter this,\u000ahowever, they withdrew into their rooms with their different burdens.
p15079
aVDolff sat smoking and dozing in his, not knowing what he was to do, or\u000ahow to meet the morrow.
p15080
aVHe was still stupid with misery, unable to use\u000ahis faculties, or to think for himself, as, poor fellow, he was but\u000alittle used to do at any time.
p15081
aVHe could not think, but only sit\u000amiserable, feeling the night to be a century long, yet without any\u000adesire for the morning.
p15082
aVAs for sleep, it was impossible, and yet, though\u000ait was so impossible, he slept the greater part of the night.
p15083
aVAs for Janet, there was no rest at all for her; the shock of the\u000aterrible events which she had witnessed, which she knew she was the\u000acause of, had affected her nerves, and more than she was aware of: but\u000ashe had been obliged to thrust it aside from her, to control herself\u000awith a hand of iron, to act with an independence and energy which she\u000adid not know she possessed, which she had never had occasion to employ\u000abefore.
p15084
aVHow could she have had occasion to display them?
p15085
aVcould such a\u000ahorrible emergency ever occur twice?
p15086
aVcould it be possible that ever\u000aagain she should be placed in such a situation?
p15087
aVEven now, when alone and\u000afree from all immediate alarm, it was a continual struggle to keep from\u000agiving vent to hysterical sounds, crying, or screaming aloud; or\u000aconvulsive sobbing, which runs into horrible pretence of laughter.
p15088
aVShe was not a girl who had ever been humiliated by any such mastery of\u000aher nerves over her will and mind.
p15089
aVBut a hundred frantic impulses seized\u000aher during this terrible night.
p15090
aVSometimes she felt as if she must\u000aprecipitate herself from the window and escape for ever and ever into\u000athe darkness; sometimes she felt disposed to tear everything about her,\u000aeven herself, in wild rage and excitement.
p15091
aVSometimes she walked\u000aabout--walked, run, flew, from one end of her room to another--unable to\u000acalm herself down.
p15092
aVAnd in calmer intervals she stole out of her room and\u000astood looking over the banisters, seeing Gussy come out of the room\u000awhere she was keeping watch, holding whispered conferences with the\u000adoctor at the door, passing in for a moment to the other room where the\u000apatient lay, from which the white-capped nurse, with her large apron\u000acreating a high light in the partial darkness we aid out to get\u000asomething that was wanted.
p15093
aVAll these noiseless movements of the watchers Janet looked upon from\u000aabove as if they were the incidents of a dream.
p15094
aVIt was all going on\u000abefore her in dumb show--an awful little dream, significant in its\u000asilence.
p15095
aVAnd the strange thing was that she felt no interest in the\u000apatient round whose unseen bed these watchers were coming and going.
p15096
aVAll\u000athe facts stood out before her.
p15097
aVThe horrors of the attempt, the touch as\u000ashe thought of sudden death, the panic of all that might follow, the\u000adreadful fear of being mixed up in it and exposed in her _rle_ of\u000atraitor to all the world, to the people at Clover who were fond of\u000aher--but any other sentiment was wholly wanting.
p15098
aVShe had brought all this upon herself and Meredith and Dolff, through\u000asomething which she had supposed to be love.
p15099
aVIt was all love, jealousy,\u000adouble dealing, the stratagems and deceits which are supposed to be\u000alegitimate in love as in war.
p15100
aVAnd yet it did not occur to Janet to care\u000awhether Meredith lived or died.
p15101
aVThe others thought that the chief thing,\u000abut she did not.
p15102
aVWhat she would have liked most would have been that he\u000ashould disappear out of her consciousness altogether, and never be more\u000aseen or heard of.
p15103
aVShe was almost impatient of the watchers and of all\u000athe anxiety there was about him, as if it mattered what became of him!
p15104
aVShe had felt as if she could almost strike at Dolff in her impatience\u000awhen, instead of attending to the precautions she prescribed to him to\u000asave his owe life, he asked, \u201cIs he dead?\u201d For herself, if an earthquake\u000acould have taken him away, buried him in the earth, so that his very\u000aname should be extinguished, that was what Janet would have liked:\u000abut----\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER XXXIV.
p15105
aVA week flew over the house in St. John\u2019s Wood like a dream.
p15106
aVYet nothing\u000acould be more erroneous than to say that it flew the days went on feet\u000aof lead, not on wings--every hour was as long as a day.
p15107
aVThe room which\u000ahad been devoted to Meredith became the centre of the house.
p15108
aVThe nurse,\u000awith her white cap and white apron, was now a recognized member of the\u000afamily.
p15109
aVShe came and went when the doctor was with the patient, or when\u000aGussy took her place, cheerful, though she had not very much that was\u000aencouraging to say.
p15110
aVShe told everybody who asked that the poor gentleman\u000awas very much the same, but her own opinion was that he was going on\u000awell.
p15111
aVHow he could be going on well while he remained unconscious she\u000acould not indeed say.
p15112
aVGussy spent a great deal of her time by that melancholy sick-bed.
p15113
aVThere\u000ais no such melancholy sick-bed.
p15114
aVThe breathing form from which the soul\u000aseems to have departed is a terrible sight to have before one\u2019s eyes day\u000aby day.
p15115
aVGussy had not the use and wont of nursing, and Meredith lying thus\u000ahelpless before her, rapt from the world and all its ways, with pathetic\u000aeyes that saw nothing, acquired the new power of utter and saddest\u000ahelplessness over the woman who loved him.
p15116
aVShe would have taken the\u000anurse\u2019s place permanently had she been permitted.
p15117
aVShe was never weary,\u000aor would never, at least, acknowledge it, but she grew thinner and\u000apaler, disinclined to say anything, sitting silent at the meals over\u000awhich she still dutifully presided, and doing everything she had been in\u000athe habit of doing with a sort of solemnity, as if that sick-bed,\u000adeath-bed--which was it?--had made the rest of the world unreal to her.
p15118
aVDolff had become silent, too.
p15119
aVHe came to no resolution, did nothing;\u000afell back into a sort of sullen use and wont.
p15120
aVBut all the gayety which\u000ahe had brought to the house in the days of the music-hall songs, all the\u000aattempts to please which had gratified his family during the time when\u000aJanet was the light of his eyes, had departed.
p15121
aVHe no longer spoke to\u000aJanet or cared for her society, though he would sit and gaze at her\u000asometimes with the strange, stern expression which was altogether unlike\u000aDolff.
p15122
aVThat this change should have been caused by Mr. Meredith\u2019s accident was\u000avery bewildering to Mrs. Harwood, who, to tell the truth, soon became\u000avery weary of Meredith\u2019s accident, and longed for his recovery chiefly\u000aas a means of getting him away.
p15123
aVShe did not for a moment believe that it\u000awas the effect of this which had changed Dolff.
p15124
aVShe believed that there\u000amust have been some quarrel with Janet--a premature proposal, perhaps,\u000awhich the governess had rejected.
p15125
aVA pretty thing indeed, Mrs. Harwood\u000acould not but reflect angrily, that a little governess should reject\u000a_her_ son!
p15126
aVbut yet no doubt the best thing that could have happened.
p15127
aVThis she felt was what it must have been, and she was glad of it, on the\u000awhole, though angry with Janet for having treated Dolff as she wished\u000ahim to be treated.
p15128
aVShe would have been much more angry had Janet\u000aaccepted his boyish proposal.
p15129
aVAs it was, all would no doubt turn out for\u000athe best; but she resented her boy\u2019s changed looks, and could not but\u000afeel a grudge against Janet for causing them.
p15130
aVTo tell the truth, in the blank of that anxious week, when everybody was\u000aabsorbed in Meredith\u2019s condition, and the house was exceedingly dull and\u000athe days very long, Janet would not have objected to resume her friendly\u000arelations with Dolff.
p15131
aVHer mind had got over the horror of the position,\u000aand somebody to talk to would have been pleasant to her.
p15132
aVBut Dolff was\u000anot disposed to listen to the voice of the charmer.
p15133
aVHe gazed at her for\u000along times together without saying a word, but it was the stare of anger\u000ahe directed upon her, and not that of love.
p15134
aVIn the meantime the police were coming and going about the house,\u000abringing reports which Dolff had been deputed to hear and examine.
p15135
aVGussy\u000aherself for a day or two had insisted upon doing this herself, but\u000apresently, as she became more and more engrossed in the sick-room, it\u000abecame impracticable.
p15136
aVShe had offered a reward for the ruffian who had\u000aso desperately assaulted her lover, and the list of men who had been\u000ataken up in succession, examined, and dismissed as having no evidence\u000aagainst them, seemed endless; though no one would seem to have been more\u000alikely than another.
p15137
aVDolff was made after a great struggle to take this\u000aduty upon him, and stolidly heard the stories which were brought to him,\u000amaking no remark.
p15138
aVScarcely a day passed in which a detective did not\u000aappear with the account of a failure; all of which Dolff listened to in\u000aa grave, dazed manner, as if he but partially understood.
p15139
aVAs it happened, however, there were some who admired this manner as\u000ajudicial; and even Gussy in her trouble approved with a smile her\u000abrother\u2019s action for her, and said in her grave, but gentle voice that\u000ait was a good thing he was showing himself so well adapted for his\u000afuture profession.
p15140
aVThe sight of these officials arriving almost daily gave Janet always a\u000apang.
p15141
aVShe was never sure that things might not some day become\u000aintolerable to Dolff--that he might not cast off this dreadful bondage\u000athat was eating into his soul, and startle everybody by saying that the\u000aman was found, that he was here ready to give himself up, and that it\u000awas Janet that was the cause.
p15142
aVThus she was never at rest--she had no\u000acertainty of him, no confidence.
p15143
aVIt seemed to her that the question\u000astood always open, that there was no telling when it might burst forth\u000aas fresh as at first, and become a story which would be edifying to all\u000athe world.
p15144
aVDolff, however, had no intention of this kind, nor had he any fear.
p15145
aVHe\u000aknew she would not betray him, and he did not care whether she did so or\u000anot.
p15146
aVHe went on dully, as it was his nature to do, taking no\u000ainitiative.
p15147
aVHe was not one who would ever have taken the grave step of\u000agiving himself up: but had anyone said to him, \u201cThou art the man\u201d--had\u000aanyone asked him, \u201cDid you do it?\u201d he would not have denied it.
p15148
aVAnd\u000aperhaps to be found out was the least miserable thing which could have\u000ahappened to this unfortunate boy.
p15149
aVThey were all sitting in the drawing-room dully enough, after the first\u000aweek was over.
p15150
aVJulia, perhaps, was happiest, who was left quite to\u000aherself, and who lay on the rug all the evening with a succession of\u000anovels, with her selection of which nobody attempted to interfere.
p15151
aVShe\u000agot them from the library herself, neither her mother nor anyone else\u000aattempting to control her.
p15152
aVMrs. Harwood, too, with a piece of white\u000afleecy knitting on her knees, perhaps, was not more dull than usual.
p15153
aVShe\u000aregretted much not to hear Dolff\u2019s cheerful voice; but then, of course,\u000asinging was impossible, and he had never been a great talker; and if\u000athere had been an unfortunate explanation between him and Janet it was\u000aall very comprehensible, poor boy.
p15154
aVNo doubt he would get over it.
p15155
aVYoung\u000amen always did get over these things; but the good mother began to turn\u000aover in her mind the desirability of getting rid of Janet--not in any\u000ahasty way, of course, but quietly, during the next term, so that Dolff\u000amight not be made uncomfortable again by the too close vicinity of the\u000agirl who had been so silly as to refuse him.
p15156
aVShe thought this over while\u000aJanet wound her wool for her, and while she called the girl \u201cMy dear,\u201d\u000aand was quite affectionate to her; but these are things which occur\u000acontinually in domestic life.
p15157
aVDolff was seated at a little distance,\u000awith a book open before him; but he did not make any pretence at\u000areading.
p15158
aVHis eyes were often intent upon Janet from behind the page, and\u000ashe was conscious of the look, but asked herself why?
p15159
aVfor there was no\u000alove now in Dolff\u2019s sullen eyes.
p15160
aVThis silent party, enlivened chiefly by Mrs. Harwood\u2019s occasional\u000aadvices or directions to Janet about the winding of the wool, had been\u000apassing the evening together, as they often did, with scarcely a change\u000aof attitude; and when the door opened suddenly they all looked up with\u000aexpectation, hoping at least for a break in the monotony somehow.
p15161
aVIt was\u000aGussy who stood in the doorway, her eyes shining with moisture and joy,\u000aand a little flush of color on her face.
p15162
aV\u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201che has spoken, he has come to himself!\u201d She came round\u000aquickly to Mrs. Harwood, and, throwing her arms round her mother, sank\u000adown upon her knees by the side of the chair.
p15163
aV\u201cOh, mamma,\u201d she said, \u201che\u000ahas come to himself: all in a moment, when we were looking for nothing\u000abut another miserable night.\u201d She knelt there, facing them all with\u000athat sudden revelation of happiness in her face.
p15164
aV\u201cHe knew me,\u201d she said.
p15165
aV\u201cI went and kissed him, I was so happy.
p15166
aVI thought it might help him to\u000awake up and throw the stupor off--but chiefly because I could not help\u000ait, because I was so happy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy darling!\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, taking her into her arms.
p15167
aVDolff and Janet, who were the spectators of this scene, unconsciously\u000aand involuntarily looked at each other, as poor Gussy made her\u000aconfession.
p15168
aVTheir eyes had never willingly met before, but something,\u000aneither could tell what, compelled them to this involuntary, more than\u000ainvoluntary, unwilling confidence.
p15169
aVThey looked at each other, the\u000asharers of a secret which neither dared reveal.
p15170
aVJanet\u2019s pale face was\u000asuddenly suffused with burning color--and Dolff looked at her with a\u000adull flame in his eyes.
p15171
aVThe thought flashed through both their minds\u000awith one impulse.
p15172
aVPoor Gussy, betraying herself in the rapture of her gladness over her\u000afalse lover\u2019s recovery, had not the faintest conception of this dark\u000asecret: but to hear of that sacred kiss of joy aroused something of the\u000aold fury in Dolff\u2019s mind.
p15173
aVHe could not bear that Gussy should disclose\u000aher weakness, and in presence of the other, the woman for whom this man\u000ahad nearly died.
p15174
aVTo sit composedly in the same room, as if they knew no\u000abetter, to hear these innocent words, to see the full faith of the\u000adeceived but happy woman, who had thus her betrothed given back to her\u000afrom the gates of death, was to Dolff unbearable.
p15175
aVHe sprang up from his\u000aseat, casting a look at Janet of rage and reproach unspeakable, and\u000ahurried to the door.
p15176
aV\u201cOh, Dolff!\u201d said Gussy, springing up and hurrying after him, \u201cyou must\u000anot, you must not!
p15177
aVThe nurse says we cannot be too careful; to look at\u000ahim even might be too much--even I must not go back to-night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI was not going near--the fellow,\u201d said Dolff, sullenly.
p15178
aV\u201cOh, I know what your impulse was!
p15179
aVDear Dolff, you have been so kind, so\u000asympathetic, never saying anything.
p15180
aVAnd perhaps you thought I didn\u2019t see\u000ait: but I have been very greatful to you--very grateful, all the time.
p15181
aVNow I can speak,\u201d Gussy cried.
p15182
aV\u201cOh, what a time it has been!
p15183
aVI was\u000abeginning to despair.
p15184
aVIt looks like a year since that dreadful night.
p15185
aVOh, thank you all, you have been so good to me--Janet, too.
p15186
aVAnd now at\u000alast I dare to hope.
p15187
aVBut you must not go near him, nobody must go.\u201d\u000aGussy loosed her hands from her brother\u2019s arm, and sat down on the chair\u000ahe had left.
p15188
aV\u201cI can have the pleasure of a cry now,\u201d she said, smiling\u000apathetically upon them all.
p15189
aV\u201cWe\u2019re not crying people in the family, are we, mamma?
p15190
aVbut it is a great\u000arelief when you have been down to the very gates of the grave and come\u000aback.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope now you will let them bring you something to eat,\u201d said Mrs.\u000aHarwood; \u201cyou have not had a proper meal for a week.
p15191
aVTell Priscilla to\u000abring a tray, Ju, and some champagne.
p15192
aVShe must have a little support\u000abefore the reaction sets in.
p15193
aVI know what it is,\u201d said the mother,\u000ashaking her head; \u201cnow that her mind is solaced she will find out that\u000ashe is as weak as water.
p15194
aVAnd, my dear, you\u2019ll not be able to nurse him\u000awhen nursing will be a real pleasure, when you will see him come round\u000aevery day--if you don\u2019t take care.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, whatever you please, mamma,\u201d said Gussy, in the docility of her\u000ahappiness.
p15195
aVShe added, \u201cTell Dolff not to go.
p15196
aVHe must not--not for any\u000areason--be disturbed to-night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI going--to disturb him?
p15197
aVI wouldn\u2019t--not for a fortune; but I can\u2019t\u000astand this any longer.
p15198
aVGussy crying, and all the rest--I am going away.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot out?\u201d said his mother, anxiously.
p15199
aVTo think there should never be a\u000agood thing without the ugly shadow of a trouble after it!
p15200
aVHe had\u000aquarrelled with Janet, and now there was nothing to keep him indoors, to\u000amake home agreeable to him.
p15201
aV\u201cIt is quite late, my dear,\u201d she said.
p15202
aV\u201cI\u000awas just going to bed.
p15203
aVDon\u2019t, oh!
p15204
aVdon\u2019t go out to-night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t, Dolff: somebody might be wanted to run for the doctor.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDid I say that I was going out?
p15205
aVI am going to my room.
p15206
aVI am going to do\u000asome work.
p15207
aVEverything here is swallowed up in Meredith, I know; no one\u000athinks of my comfort.
p15208
aVBut, after all, I\u2019m something more than a man kept\u000aon the premises to run for a doctor.
p15209
aVI am going to my room to do some\u000awork.
p15210
aVGood-night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGood-night, dear boy,\u201d said his mother, holding out her hand to him.
p15211
aV\u201cYes, go and do a little work--that\u2019s always good for you.
p15212
aVDon\u2019t take\u000ahim at his word, Gussy.
p15213
aVHe is as glad as any of us; but that\u2019s a boy\u2019s\u000away.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI know, mamma,\u201d said Gussy, with a serene smile.
p15214
aVShe beamed upon her\u000asullen brother as if his very ill-humor were something to thank him for.
p15215
aV\u201cThey will never let one see what they feel,\u201d she said.
p15216
aVHad she but known!
p15217
aVDolff went to his room with a surging of blood to his\u000ahead and trouble in his heart.
p15218
aVIt was partly relief--for no doubt to be\u000afree of the horror of blood-guiltiness was much: and his heart was\u000aunspeakably lightened by the thought that Meredith had recovered, that\u000ahis own hasty fury, the boiling rage into which he had been driven, was\u000anot to have fatal consequences.
p15219
aVThere was to be no stigma on his soul.
p15220
aVHe need not now spend all his life with blood upon his head, never\u000aknowing when he might be found out and hunted down.
p15221
aVBut this very relief opened the doors of his mind to the sentiments\u000awhich had been repressed under the influence of that horror and fear.
p15222
aVThat Gussy should believe in the man whom he had heard and seen so\u000afalse--so false!
p15223
aVwho had jeered and laughed at her devotion and talked\u000aof her to another woman, another traitor!
p15224
aVthat she should hang over his\u000abed and kiss him when he came back to himself!
p15225
aVDolff ground his teeth\u000aand muttered an oath of fury.
p15226
aVThe last thing in the fellow\u2019s\u000aconsciousness must be that lingering talk with Janet, holding her hands,\u000amaking love to her--and the next would be Gussy\u2019s kiss!
p15227
aVDolff felt that\u000ahe could not bear it--the villain, the rascal, the cad!
p15228
aVAnd now he would be courted and petted back to life, he would be\u000asurrounded continually by the tenderest care and attention, he would be\u000acaressed, and flattered, and consoled, while he, Dolff was desired to be\u000ain the house solely that he might, if necessary, run for the doctor!
p15229
aVIt\u000awas too much.
p15230
aVDolff set his teeth, and the thought flashed through his\u000amind that if he had such a deceiver in his hands, nobody near!
p15231
aVBut if it\u000ahad not been for the relief of knowing that he had failed that time he\u000awould not have dared to think such a thought now.
p15232
aVCHAPTER XXXV.
p15233
aVJanet was not moved either by Gussy\u2019s rapture or Dolff\u2019s rage.
p15234
aVTo say\u000athat she was not relieved would be untrue, for it was, no doubt, a great\u000arelief to know that she was not in any way responsible for a man\u2019s\u000adeath.
p15235
aVBut beyond this her strongest feeling was annoyance, a painful\u000asense that she was not quit of the consequences, that he was still there\u000ato be reckoned with, more near than ever, under the same roof.
p15236
aVWould he\u000abe changed as she was by the catastrophe which had nearly cut off his\u000alife?
p15237
aVor would he, returning to life from his unconsciousness, and\u000aprobably knowing much less about it than any of those round him, take up\u000aeverything from the moment the thread had dropped from his hands and\u000aexpect her to do the same?
p15238
aVJanet had got a tremendous lesson, such a lesson as not one foolish girl\u000ain a million is ever exposed to: and all her lighter feelings--the\u000amischievous pleasure of taking another woman\u2019s lover from her, which is\u000aso often merely a piece of fun to an unthinking girl; the excitement of\u000abeing made love to; the fascination of contact with the first man who\u000ahad ventured to seize upon her attention, to take her interest for\u000agranted, to draw her, as it were, into the current of his own being--all\u000athese sensations had died in the horror with which that sudden murderous\u000aassault had filled her, and the double horror of being mixed up in it,\u000aheld up before the world as the cause, with a stigma upon her forever.
p15239
aVJanet had liked to amuse herself all her life, and it was irresistible\u000ato triumph over the composed and self-confident Gussy, to take her lover\u000afrom her, and watch sarcastically behind backs the self-exposure of the\u000avictim, and laugh internally, though never without a half shame, at the\u000a\u201csilliness,\u201d which wounded Julia\u2019s sharp perception, in her sister.
p15240
aVJulia saw it as well as Janet, though she did not know the cause.
p15241
aVAnd\u000ashe had liked the bold love-making, the wicked looks aside which had at\u000aonce placed her on a platform above Gussy; those confidences which\u000aMeredith had begun to make to her from the first, and which had at once\u000aestablished a secret link between them.
p15242
aVHe had been the interest and\u000aamusement of the dull life which Janet had never had time to get tired\u000aof, so interesting was the drama he had played for her and made her\u000aplay; and she had liked to be made love to in that bold, presumptuous\u000away.
p15243
aVThere was something piquant in it, especially in contrast with the\u000aclumsy devotion of Dolff.
p15244
aVIt had carried her at last a little out of her\u000aown control, in the hurrying sensations of the night of the ball: and\u000athe touch of jealousy after, and the complication of the events of that\u000anight--of the discovery of the papers which she was compelled to send\u000ahim, and the meeting she was compelled to grant him for the sake of\u000aclearing up that mystery--had all added an impetus to the downward\u000astream upon which Janet was going.
p15245
aVHad it not been interrupted so abruptly, it is probable that she might\u000ahave been floated on beyond her own control, carried to depths beyond\u000aher anticipation, and become Meredith\u2019s slave and victim, if not his\u000awife.
p15246
aVBut it had scarcely got beyond the stage of amusement to Janet\u000awhen it was thus cut in a moment, the link which was twisting round her\u000asevered at a blow.
p15247
aVAnd now how glad she would have been to be done with\u000ait, to hear of him no more, to wipe it entirely out of her life!
p15248
aVIt had\u000aoccurred to her, indeed, that she might do that by leaving the Harwoods;\u000abut she was too young, although so independent and self-sustaining, to\u000amake up her mind easily to such a trenchant proceeding.
p15249
aVShe would have\u000ato explain to her friends at Clover why, after all her praises of the\u000aHarwoods, she left them so soon.
p15250
aVShe would have to take a great deal of\u000atrouble, probably to sacrifice much of her comfort--for Janet was not so\u000aentirely inexperienced as not to know that few governesses were treated\u000aso well as she was.
p15251
aVTherefore, she rejected the idea of going away, or\u000arather, it but flew through her mind as a suggestion which was much too\u000adecided and important to be adopted on her own responsibility.
p15252
aVBut to hear of Meredith\u2019s progress towards recovery troubled Janet\u000aextremely.
p15253
aVIt was like thrusting him upon her again, recommencing a\u000abusiness which she had been glad to believe concluded.
p15254
aVShe was annoyed\u000aand impatient--scornful of Gussy\u2019s rapture, indisposed to hear anything\u000afurther of the matter.
p15255
aVWhen she left the room with her pupil, leaving\u000athe mother and daughter going over and over the minutest details--of how\u000athe patient had opened his eyes; how he had looked around with a\u000abewildered glance; how his face had lighted up at the sight of Gussy,\u000aetc., Janet was almost angry at the fuss they were making, and provoked\u000abeyond description by their delight and endless anticipations.
p15256
aV\u201cAfter this he\u2019ll make progress every day,\u201d Mrs. Harwood said.
p15257
aV\u201cAnd oh, mamma, to think he is himself again--to think that he\u000arecognized me!\u201d cried Gussy.
p15258
aVOh, cried Janet to herself, if they but knew!
p15259
aVShe thought, like Dolff,\u000aof the last scene that had been present to his consciousness before that\u000aawakening, and Gussy\u2019s kiss; of how he had stood laughing, holding her\u000ahands, not letting her go, making fun of Gussy; and the next thing he\u000awas aware of--a dim sick-room, a nurse in a white cap, and Gussy, who\u000akissed him in her joy!
p15260
aVIt was all Janet could do not to burst out with\u000asomething contradictory, something that would express all the\u000acontrariety of her feelings.
p15261
aVIt was a good thing to get out of the room,\u000ato be out of temptation.
p15262
aVShe did not remark Julia\u2019s keen inspection of\u000aher in the vehemence of the perturbation in her own mind.
p15263
aV\u201cWell,\u201d said Julia as they went upstairs; \u201cit\u2019s a good thing he is\u000abetter, though I wish Gussy would not be always so silly about him.
p15264
aVAren\u2019t you glad he is better, Janet?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDid you think,\u201d said Janet, \u201cthat I wished him to be worse?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh!
p15265
aVI don\u2019t know.
p15266
aVI used to think you liked Charley Meredith; but I\u2019m\u000aalmost sure you don\u2019t now.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOne may not care for a man, and yet one may be glad he is better.
p15267
aVI am\u000asick,\u201d cried Janet, unable to control herself, \u201cof hearing his name.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, so am I!\u201d cried Julia.
p15268
aV\u201cIsn\u2019t it enough to make one ill?
p15269
aVAnd now\u000athere will be more of it than ever.
p15270
aVWe shall all be wanted to rejoice\u000aover him.
p15271
aVI wish he had gone to his own chambers to be killed, and not\u000ahere.\u201d\u000a\u000aBy this time they had reached the school-room, which was their common\u000aproperty, and where no one could interfere with their talk.
p15272
aVJulia threw\u000aherself into a chair before the fire and pursued her inquiries.
p15273
aV\u201cDid you ever think to yourself,\u201d she said, \u201cJanet, how it was that\u000aCharley should have been assaulted like that?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThink!\u201d said Janet, faltering.
p15274
aV\u201cI don\u2019t know what good thinking would\u000ado.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat may be,\u201d said Julia, \u201cbut one can\u2019t help thinking, though it may\u000ado no good.
p15275
aVI hate him so much myself that I understand it better than\u000ayou can, who used to like him.
p15276
aVIt must have been some one who hated\u000ahim--even more than me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t talk so about a--a crime, Julia: and don\u2019t say me instead of I,\u201d\u000aJanet cried, hoping to stop this embarrassing discussion.
p15277
aV\u201cOh, what does stupid grammar matter!
p15278
aVMy opinion is that it must have\u000abeen something about a girl.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJulia!\u201d cried the governess, taking refuge in the shock of conventional\u000ahorror at such a suggestion from such a quarter.
p15279
aV\u201cOh, you know as well as I do what Charley was.
p15280
aVI have heard even mamma\u000asay that he couldn\u2019t resist making himself agreeable, whoever it was.
p15281
aVThat\u2019s mamma\u2019s way of putting it.
p15282
aVWhy, he has made eyes even at\u000ame--Gussy\u2019s sister, and only fifteen, and hating him as I do!
p15283
aVIt stands\u000ato reason that he did it to everybody else.
p15284
aVAnd suppose there was some\u000asilly girl who thought it meant something, and somebody belonging to her\u000awho wouldn\u2019t put up with it?
p15285
aVOh, I\u2019ve wished often I was a man and could\u000aknock him down!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen a man is lying so ill as he is, it is dreadful to talk of hating\u000ahim.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, but you can\u2019t help it, however dreadful it may be!
p15286
aVand, besides,\u000ahe\u2019s getting better.
p15287
aVYou don\u2019t like him yourself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI never said so,\u201d said Janet.
p15288
aV\u201cBut I know.
p15289
aVAnd you did like him once.
p15290
aVWhat has made you change your\u000amind?
p15291
aVDo you know--but I won\u2019t say it; you will be angry.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou had better say it--whatever you want to say.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, then, I think--you needn\u2019t blaze out upon me, for of course I may\u000abe quite silly--Janet, I think you know something about it.
p15292
aVThere!
p15293
aVOh,\u000ayou may kill me if you like with your eyes, but that won\u2019t make any\u000adifference!
p15294
aVI think you\u2019ve known something about it all the time.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet\u2019s eyes gave forth a flash.
p15295
aVIf it had been Gussy who had made this\u000acharge instead of Julia, her mind was so excited and troubled that, in\u000aall likelihood, she would have burst forth with the secret which she had\u000abeen so anxious hitherto to conceal.
p15296
aVShe stood looking at the girl,\u000ahappy to feel that her blood did not rush to her cheeks as it had done\u000aalready this evening.
p15297
aVShe said:\u000a\u000a\u201cI think you are mad, Julia, to ask me such a question.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t ask any question.
p15298
aVI said I thought--and so I do, and\u000anothing you can say will change me.
p15299
aVShall I tell you what I think?
p15300
aVI\u000athink you were out at the door or at the staircase window--where Gussy\u000aalways goes to watch for people--and that you saw it, and saw who did\u000ait, and won\u2019t tell.
p15301
aVI suppose it\u2019s from a good motive,\u201d said Julia, \u201cto\u000asave somebody.
p15302
aVI should do it myself, but that would be chiefly because\u000aI hate _him_, not to give him the satisfaction.
p15303
aVHowever, only wait till\u000aCharley Meredith gets well.
p15304
aVOh!
p15305
aVtrust him to find it all out.
p15306
aVHe\u2019ll not\u000alet anybody off.
p15307
aVHe\u2019ll have no mercy.
p15308
aVNow, that\u2019s my opinion, Janet, if\u000ayou like to know.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey are very bold opinions,\u201d said Janet; \u201cscarcely what a girl should\u000aventure to express; but I was neither at the staircase-window nor at the\u000adoor, and if all that you imagine besides is as true as what you say of\u000ame----\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet did not like to commit herself to an absolutely false statement,\u000athough she had no objection to deceive.
p15309
aVShe liked, when she could, to\u000aanswer inconvenient questions _au pied de la lettre_ in a way which\u000amight be true.
p15310
aVThus she was not at the door in Julia\u2019s sense of the\u000aword, but standing outside the door, perilously near it.
p15311
aVShe concluded\u000awith herself that, in saying she was not at the door, she was saying the\u000aexact and formal truth.
p15312
aV\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know!\u201d said Julia; \u201cyou may convince me as much as you\u000alike, but I\u2019ll be of the same opinion still.
p15313
aVThe only thing is, I just\u000awarn you how it will be when Charley Meredith gets well.
p15314
aVHe won\u2019t\u000aforgive the man that did that.
p15315
aVHe won\u2019t forgive you if you\u2019re mixed up\u000ain it.
p15316
aVDon\u2019t be mixed up in Charley Meredith\u2019s affairs, Janet.
p15317
aVHe\u2019ll get\u000ato the bottom of it as soon as he is well.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are a Daniel come to judgment,\u201d said Janet, with a laugh.
p15318
aVHow strange a thing a laugh was from her at such a moment!
p15319
aVFor, though\u000aJulia was only a child, what she said was true enough.
p15320
aVMeredith, when he\u000agot well, was not a man who would blunder about as the policeman did,\u000ahearing every story, not knowing how to separate the grain from the\u000achaff.
p15321
aVEven, he was a lawyer too, she reflected, with a gleam of terror.
p15322
aVHe would know how to put things together.
p15323
aVPerhaps--this was possible,\u000atoo--Dolff\u2019s face, white and distorted by passion, might have been\u000arevealed to him as he fell, as it was to Janet.
p15324
aVHe might remember as his\u000afaculties came back, and he would be able to follow it out.
p15325
aVGoing back upon that evening, Janet began to trace with horror the\u000aevidence that might be got together.
p15326
aVThere were the people at the\u000alibrary who saw them meet and speak to each other, and who might have\u000aseen them walk off together, thus identifying her at least.
p15327
aVAnd Meredith\u000ahimself would know that she must have witnessed the attack upon him.
p15328
aVHer\u000aanxieties had been quieted by this long want of cessation from all\u000aprogress.
p15329
aVBut now that he was getting well!
p15330
aVOh, Julia was right.
p15331
aVHe\u000awould let no one off; he would take full vengeance for his injuries.
p15332
aVAll\u000athe world would know how she was mixed up in it!
p15333
aVShe would have to\u000aappear, to be cross-examined, to tell all she knew, and explain how she\u000awas there, and it would be in all the newspapers.
p15334
aVThis was what chiefly struck Janet with anguish and terror unspeakable.
p15335
aVEverybody would know it!
p15336
aVHer friends would look upon her darkly; the\u000avicarage--even that kind house would close its doors.
p15337
aVTo be traitor to\u000athe people who had been so kind to her--to meet another woman\u2019s lover,\u000athe betrothed of the daughter of the house!
p15338
aVWho would have anything to\u000asay to a governess who had done that?
p15339
aVAnd though she might tell the\u000aepisode of the papers, and thus account for her communications with\u000aMeredith, who would believe her?
p15340
aVJanet had an hour or two of extreme\u000aanguish turning this all over in her mind.
p15341
aVAfter this, however, she grew a little more composed.
p15342
aVPerhaps Meredith\u000awould be kept back by the fact that he himself would be affected as much\u000aas she by any such revelation.
p15343
aVProbably he would not, for his own sake,\u000alike it to be known that he had clandestine meetings with the\u000agoverness.
p15344
aVThis was of all others the thing that would damn him, not\u000aonly in St. John\u2019s Wood, but wherever there were families to which he\u000amight wish to recommend himself.
p15345
aVIf it all came out, Gussy would no\u000adoubt be lost to him (if he had ever cared for Gussy), and not only\u000aGussy but every young lady in his own position, and the mother of every\u000ayoung lady.
p15346
aVTo have clandestine meetings with the governess--to make\u000alove behind backs to the governess!
p15347
aVJanet\u2019s heart calmed down in its\u000atumultuous beating when this blessed thought came into her mind.
p15348
aVNo, he\u000awould not betray himself in that way.
p15349
aVHe might not care for betraying\u000aher, but he would not betray himself.
p15350
aVHe would not allow himself to be\u000aheld up to the contempt of the world, put into all the papers, perhaps\u000ainto _Punch_, with a shabby girl clinging to him in the dock.
p15351
aVJanet, who thought of everything in the sharply acute state of her\u000aperceptions, remembered too that, while the ladies would think it the\u000ablackest treachery to carry on a correspondence with the governess, the\u000anewspapers would take the other side, and would be chiefly indignant\u000aconcerning the wrongs of the poor girl, blighted by her dependent\u000aposition, whom this monster was endeavoring to beguile and lead astray.
p15352
aVAh, no!
p15353
aVMeredith would not lay himself open to these critics.
p15354
aVHe would\u000akeep her out of it, since otherwise he himself would suffer.
p15355
aVIt calmed\u000aher entirely after a time to follow out this point of view.
p15356
aVBut, oh!
p15357
aVif he could but be spirited away to the other end of the world.
p15358
aVOh, if she could but be quit of him--but forget that she had ever seen\u000ahim!
p15359
aVJanet looked towards the room of the convalescent with a tremor.
p15360
aVWhat would his feelings be?
p15361
aVWould he expect to take up the thread where\u000ait had dropped?
p15362
aVWould he go on telling her with his eyes what a fool\u000aGussy was?
p15363
aVhow ridiculous was her confidence in herself!
p15364
aVhow much more\u000ahe cared for herself, Janet, than for anybody else in the world!
p15365
aVThis,\u000ashe thought, would be the most intolerable of all.
p15366
aVCHAPTER XXXVI.
p15367
aVAfter this fright, however, which was--so much is that poison to one\u000awhich is another\u2019s antidote--so joyful for Gussy, everything relapsed\u000ainto a still and apprehensive silence which to two in the house seemed\u000afull of fate.
p15368
aVBetter and better was the news that came from the\u000asick-room.
p15369
aVMorning after morning Gussy came to the breakfast-table pale\u000abut radiant with the bulletin.
p15370
aVBetter, and better, and better.
p15371
aVHe not\u000aonly knew her, but had smiled and said a few words.
p15372
aVHe had a long and\u000arefreshing sleep.
p15373
aVHe was promoted to a little solid food.
p15374
aVThe doctor was\u000asatisfied, nay, astonished, at the progress made.
p15375
aVBut all this took a\u000along time.
p15376
aVThere was a long interval of that dark and melancholy weather which\u000agives winter its special horror in London--one day more dull and gray\u000aand dismal than the other, depressing in any circumstances, miserable\u000awhen there is anxiety and suspense within.
p15377
aVThe new year had begun with\u000athe chills and snows and dreariness which so often accompany it.
p15378
aVThe\u000aonly relief in the prospect was that Dolff ere many days had passed\u000awould have to return to Oxford.
p15379
aVIf it only might be that he could go\u000awithout seeing the convalescent?
p15380
aVHe wished this himself in a\u000ahalf-and-half way sometimes, hoping that he might not be compelled to\u000acongratulate Meredith on his recovery, or indeed face him at all, though\u000ahe was glad that he was getting well: yet sometimes also with a lurking\u000adesire to see him, to judge for himself how much he was changed, and if\u000ahe had any consciousness of \u201cwhat had happened.\u201d Dolff did not indicate\u000ato himself the tremendous moment of his passion by any more clear\u000adescription than this.
p15381
aVPerhaps on the whole he wished more than he\u000afeared to see Meredith again.
p15382
aVThen perhaps he would get out of his eyes\u000athe white face upon the pavement, with the faint lamplight upon it,\u000awhich he had never been able to forget.
p15383
aVThe day on which Meredith was first allowed to see the family was a\u000aMonday in the middle of January.
p15384
aVHis couch was wheeled into the\u000adrawing-room in the afternoon, Gussy proudly attending and announcing\u000aher patient.
p15385
aVThe daylight was beginning to wane, and to two at least of\u000athe party it was more easy to see him than it was for him to see them.
p15386
aVJanet had withdrawn into the further part of the room, as was becoming\u000ain her position, and Dolff stood uneasily near the door, removing\u000ahimself, without intention, in the mere excitement and uneasiness of\u000athis first meeting, from the light.
p15387
aVMeredith was still very pale, and\u000athe change in his face, which had been florid red and white, was\u000astriking.
p15388
aVHis black hair, and the beard which had grown during his\u000aillness, made his pallor still more apparent, but it was scarcely the\u000apaleness which gives refinement and spirituality to a face worn with\u000asuffering.
p15389
aVHe shook hands with them all, and turned his head, asking,\u000a\u201cIs that Miss Summerhayes?\u201d in a way which compelled Janet to come\u000aforward, though so much against her will.
p15390
aVHe glanced up at her with\u000asomething of his old look, a sort of smile in his eyes, the telegraph of\u000aold, which implied some secret understanding between them, and which\u000aonce had so fluttered Janet\u2019s heart.
p15391
aVBut it only brought a sickening\u000athrill now of alarm and repugnance.
p15392
aVThis was the only thing she noted\u000aspecially in the first interview, a look which showed her that all was\u000anot over, that he was not ready yet to relinquish the amusement which\u000ashe had given him (if that was how to describe it), and that, though he\u000ahad been at death\u2019s door, and was so much altered in appearance, in\u000ahimself he was not changed.
p15393
aVJanet was too young to know that to be at\u000adeath\u2019s door is no sufficient reason for any change in that strange and\u000aperverse thing which is called the heart.
p15394
aVShe had been a little moved by\u000athe sight of him, so colorless and feeble, notwithstanding the change in\u000aher own feelings towards him.
p15395
aVThere is something piteous in the sight of\u000aa strong man, young, and in the flower of life, lying helpless upon a\u000acouch, ministered to like a child.
p15396
aVIt touched her heart, and something\u000aof the reverence for weakness, which is inherent in humanity, moved her\u000aas she came unwillingly, yet obediently to his side.
p15397
aVBut that side\u000aglance, the old confidential look, the smile which might have been\u000acalled a leer by a more severe spectator, caught Janet in the midst of\u000aher momentary awe, and drove her back upon herself.
p15398
aVShe was not, as the\u000areader knows, so lofty in her views, so generous in her motives, as\u000awould become a heroine; but she was startled and shocked by this, and\u000athrown back into her original dismay and fear.
p15399
aVAfter this he saw the family every day.
p15400
aVIt became the habit of the house\u000aas he slowly recovered (and it was very slow progress) to have the couch\u000arolled into the drawing-room every day, visitors shut out, and the whole\u000aefforts of the household, which were not very effectual in that\u000adepartment, devoted to the amusement of the patient.
p15401
aVThey were not very\u000aclever in the way of amusement.
p15402
aVMrs. Harwood talked to him, occasionally\u000alighting upon an old story which had some interest for the invalid, and\u000aGussy talked with no such reservoir of interest to fall back upon,\u000agenerally dropping after a time into household details, which did not\u000aamuse him at all.
p15403
aVJanet, when she was not able to escape, sat demurely silent as far off\u000aas possible, her head bent over her work; and Dolff, who seemed to have\u000abeen seized by a feverish desire to be present during these sances, as\u000aif something to his detriment might happen if he were absent, stood\u000aabout, sometimes standing at one window, sometimes at another, adjured\u000aby his mother and sister not to get into the light, uncomfortable and\u000aunnecessary everywhere.
p15404
aVMeredith, as he got able to talk a little, took\u000aup again his old habit of somewhat contemptuous banter to Dolff.
p15405
aVHe\u000abegged to know if he had not been singing lately--if Miss Summerhayes\u000ahad been cruel and ceased to play the accompaniments, which she was so\u000aclever at.
p15406
aVIt was evident that his mind was far from any painful\u000aassociations in respect to Dolff.
p15407
aVHe declared that it would amuse him to\u000ahear one of the old songs.
p15408
aV\u201cNot the new ones,\u201d he said, with that exasperating smile, \u201cthe refined\u000aones, which Miss Summerhayes prefers.
p15409
aVSing me one of those, Dolff, that\u000ayou brought from the Vic.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOne of those!
p15410
aVThey\u2019re not fit for a drawing-room, Meredith; you know\u000athey\u2019re not.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe heard them in the drawing-room often enough, didn\u2019t we, Gussy!
p15411
aVCome,\u000ahumor me--everybody humors me--sing me--that one, you know, with the\u000achorus--\u201d and the sick man hummed a bar or two of the most uproarious of\u000athose songs which had so startled the decorous family.
p15412
aVHe laughed and flashed at Janet--who by some extraordinary trick of\u000anature was aware now, when her back was turned to him, of those looks--a\u000awicked glance.
p15413
aVNothing he could have asked would have been more painful,\u000anothing could have shone more distinctly the mockery and malice of his\u000aintention.
p15414
aVA man who had nearly died calling upon his almost murderer\u000afor a rollicking music-hall song!
p15415
aVIt was a ghastly request to the two\u000aperformers, who looked at each other, or, rather, who looked each in the\u000adirection of where the other was, with a sort of helpless, mutual\u000aappeal.
p15416
aV\u201cWhy don\u2019t you do it, Dolff, when Charley asks you?
p15417
aVWhat does it matter,\u000aif it\u2019s not very suitable, so long as it amuses him?\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff muttered something about being out of practice, not having sung\u000aanything for weeks.
p15418
aV\u201cNo,\u201d said Meredith, \u201cI know how everybody has denied themselves for me.
p15419
aVNever mind; I shall like it just as much.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCan\u2019t you go and do it, Dolff?\u201d cried Gussy, impatiently, \u201cwhen he\u000atells you it will amuse him?
p15420
aVIt is not for you, to show off how well you\u000acan do it.
p15421
aVI daresay it will amuse him more if you do it very badly.
p15422
aVWhat does it matter if you are in practice or not?\u201d\u000a\u000aOnce more Dolff murmured something to the effect that he did not like to\u000abe laughed at, with his head down between his shoulders and his chin on\u000ahis breast.
p15423
aV\u201cGood heavens!\u201d cried Gussy, \u201cas if it mattered!
p15424
aVI should have thought\u000ayou would be glad to be laughed at, so long as it amused him.\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff turned his head towards Janet in an appeal for help.
p15425
aVShe was as\u000aunwilling as he was, and felt the tragic ridicule of the proposal even\u000amore keenly, as well as the malice and cruel amusement in Meredith\u2019s\u000aeyes.
p15426
aVShe knew that he was trying to catch her attention to make her the\u000aconfidante of his meaning as usual; but Janet kept her eyes fixed upon\u000aher work, and would not see.
p15427
aVAt length, however, she rose up, and\u000aputting away the needlework she was busy with, went to the piano.
p15428
aVIf it\u000ahad to be done, it was better to do it without further remark.
p15429
aVShe had\u000aplayed the first bars of the accompaniment several times over before\u000aDolff reluctantly followed her.
p15430
aVIt was almost the first time he had\u000avoluntarily addressed Janet in all those weeks.
p15431
aVHe said, sullenly, \u201cDoes\u000ahe want to drive me mad?
p15432
aVIs that his revenge?\u201d over her head.
p15433
aVJanet replied, playing softly,\u000a\u000a\u201cHe knows nothing yet.
p15434
aVHe wants to make us both ridiculous, for no\u000areason.
p15435
aVSing; I\u2019ll help you all I can.\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff breathed a sigh that fluttered the music upon the piano.
p15436
aV\u201cWhat pluck you have,\u201d he said, with unwilling admiration.
p15437
aVHe had sworn never to trust her again, never to have anything to do with\u000aher; but how hard it was when he stood by her thus, and felt the charm\u000aof her presence, the readiness and courage and support of her little\u000aalert soul.
p15438
aV\u201cSing,\u201d she said, firmly, holding down the beginning notes to make a\u000a_bruyant_, noisy dash of sound and give him courage.
p15439
aVAnd Dolff sang--like a martyr--giving forth the uproarious, would-be fun\u000aof the words as if they were a psalm, stumbling over every second line,\u000alosing his place, forgetting what came next.
p15440
aVThe audience laughed behind\u000athem audibly, noisily, as indeed was right enough, and the effect\u000aintended by the song.
p15441
aVBut it was not at the song they laughed, but at\u000athe singer and his ludicrous gravity, and the embarrassment which was\u000afreely attributed to temper, both by his mother and sister.
p15442
aVMrs. Harwood was a little offended at last by the laughter of the others\u000athough it was an absurd performance.
p15443
aVA woman soon becomes weary of\u000aridicule when called forth by a child of her own.
p15444
aV\u201cYou are very merry,\u201d she said.
p15445
aV\u201cI never heard you laugh so much before,\u000aGussy, at your brother\u2019s performance.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is very absurd, mamma.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is very absurd, I know,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, with a little rising\u000acolor, \u201cand I think it was very self-denying of Dolff to consent to make\u000ahimself ridiculous for Charley\u2019s amusement.
p15446
aVYou ought to be a little\u000agrateful to him instead of making fun of him.
p15447
aVMany would not have done\u000ait,\u201d said the mother, with a toss upward of her head.
p15448
aV\u201cMamma!
p15449
aVwhy, he used to sing like that every evening when he came home\u000afirst.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t you interfere, Ju.
p15450
aVIf he did, he has seen since that, as he said,\u000ait was not appropriate to a drawing-room: and I think it is very good of\u000ahim, exceedingly self-denying and kind, to do it--when he is more or\u000aless making a fool of himself--to amuse Charley.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDear Mrs. Harwood,\u201d said Meredith, from his sofa, \u201cI am getting\u000aselfish; you are all so good to me.
p15451
aVAnd I am very much obliged to Dolff.
p15452
aVI have not laughed so much since--I hope he doesn\u2019t mind.
p15453
aVThanks, Dolff;\u000athat\u2019s capital.
p15454
aVYou\u2019ve sung it like--like the great--what do you call\u000athe man?--Barry himself.
p15455
aVLet us have another, please.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Dolff hurried off as soon as he had uttered the last note, with a\u000asense of humiliation which nothing else could have given\u000ahim--humiliation, contempt of himself, misery which could not be gauged\u000aby any moral estimate.
p15456
aVHe felt as if all that he had ever done to\u000aMeredith was fully paid and atoned for by the exhibition he had thus\u000abeen compelled to make: and that, if this were to go on, he would fly at\u000athe fellow\u2019s throat some day and this time make sure work of it.
p15457
aVHis look, his laugh--which had never stopped--which began before the\u000aperformance began, which was not at his song but at him, roused every\u000agrim possibility in Dolff\u2019s nature.
p15458
aVWas that to be his revenge, the\u000acoward?
p15459
aVa revenge like a woman\u2019s, and yet more cruel.
p15460
aVTo make him\u000aridiculous--to hold him up to derision.
p15461
aVAnd Gussy, with her smile,\u000abacking up that fellow, who had bewitched her!
p15462
aVDolff suddenly bethought\u000ahimself of all he knew, and of what the effect would be upon Gussy if he\u000areported to her what he had seen and heard.
p15463
aVThis thought sobered him and\u000acalmed down the tumult in his veins.
p15464
aVIf Gussy knew--if she could be made\u000aaware that, as Meredith laughed at himself, Dolff, so had he laughed at\u000aher, and that to another woman--a woman the deceiver loved, or pretended\u000ato love.
p15465
aVDolff was but a rough fellow, hot-tempered, wanting in delicacy of\u000afeeling--but when he thought of the effect of that enlightenment upon\u000ahis sister he shrank within himself.
p15466
aVNo; it would be too much to let her\u000aknow.
p15467
aVIt was true, also, that he could not let her know without\u000abetraying his own dreadful secret, and ruining Janet.
p15468
aVWhy should he\u000amind ruining Janet, who had cared so little either for the honor or\u000atruth of her friends!
p15469
aVBut he began to reflect, with a softening heart,\u000athat Janet had certainly stood by him.
p15470
aVShe had prevented him from giving\u000ahimself up at first.
p15471
aVShe had held him up all along.
p15472
aVShe had not\u000aabandoned him even now, but supported him in that hideous song, though\u000ashe hated it.
p15473
aVPoor Dolff!
p15474
aVit was a sad thing for him to have stood so close to her at\u000athe piano, to have felt the spell again, though she had not so much as\u000alooked at him.
p15475
aVNo doubt it was her fault at the first, led astray by\u000athat fellow and his blandishments--but since, there was not a word to be\u000asaid against her; she had stood by him, sustained him, kept him from\u000acommitting himself--even in the horror of this song she had made it\u000abearable by sharing the scorn, by covering him when he failed.
p15476
aVPerhaps\u000ahe had been hard upon Janet!
p15477
aVOh, if that little fact, that short,\u000aall-important scrap of time could be but blown away, made to vanish and\u000ato be heard of no more!
p15478
aVOh, if he could but forget, and return to what\u000ahe was before!
p15479
aVMany a man has had the same thought before Dolff: a\u000alittle scrap of time, a single day, an hour or two--and to think that\u000ashould influence, darken, perhaps ruin, a whole life; and that no power\u000aon earth could do away with it--not that of all the kings and potentates\u000athat ever were!
p15480
aVAt all events, Dolff added to himself fiercely, in\u000aconclusion, if only that fellow were out of the house--if only it were\u000anot the first idea of everybody to nurse and tend and amuse him.
p15481
aVAmuse\u000ahim!
p15482
aVand that he himself, of all others, should be made to exhibit and\u000ado tricks like a monkey for Charley Meredith\u2019s sake!
p15483
aV\u201cOur songster has forsaken us,\u201d said Meredith; \u201cbut it was very good\u000awhile it lasted.
p15484
aVDolff has a great deal of expression, Mrs. Harwood.
p15485
aVYou\u000amay not like that sort of thing, which is not exactly, as he said,\u000aadapted for drawing-rooms, but he does it very well; not quite so well\u000aas before Miss Summerhayes converted him, but still well enough.
p15486
aVIt\u000aseems to me, Gussy, as if the conversion was not going on----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed, I don\u2019t at all know what you refer to,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood; \u201cnor\u000ahow my son wanted conversion, Charley--and by Miss Summerhayes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI only meant musically,\u201d said the patient, with a little air of\u000alanguor.
p15487
aVHe added, \u201cI have laughed too much.
p15488
aVIt is a pleasant way of\u000aexhaustion, but it is exhaustion all the same.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI was afraid it would be too much for you,\u201d cried the ever-anxious\u000aGussy; \u201cyou over-estimate your strength.
p15489
aVLay back your head, dear\u000aCharley, and perhaps you will get a little sleep.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI take great liberties with you all,\u201d he said, \u201cbut not so much as to\u000ago to sleep in your mother\u2019s drawing-room, Gussy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, my dear boy, don\u2019t think of that,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, at once\u000aforgetting his offence before this exhibition of weakness.
p15490
aV\u201cYou are spoiling me,\u201d he said, half closing his eyes.
p15491
aV\u201cHow am I ever to\u000ago out into the world again after all this coddling?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAsk Miss Summerhayes to play one of those nocturnes she plays so well:\u000athat will do as well as sleep,\u201d said Gussy.
p15492
aVHe put out his hand for hers, drawing it beneath the rug that covered\u000ahim.
p15493
aVGussy\u2019s countenance beamed with a mild rapture as she sat close by\u000athe couch with her hand in his.
p15494
aVIt was pleasant to this luxurious person\u000ato hold in his--whoever the owner of it might be--a woman\u2019s hand.
p15495
aVAnd Janet sat and played--softly, entering into the dramatic situation\u000anotwithstanding the repugnance and revolt in her heart.
p15496
aVShe could not\u000ahelp entering into her _rle_--soothing the invalid with soft music,\u000arolling forth gently from the piano, in subdued notes, the spirit of a\u000anocturne which was full of balmy night air and the soft influences of\u000athe stars--yet in herself feeling all that was unlike to this, an\u000aimpatience which she could scarcely restrain, a fierce dislike and\u000aresentment.
p15497
aVHe had made her share in Dolff\u2019s ridiculousness, and now he\u000amade her play him to sleep like a slave, like something that belonged to\u000ahim and had no right to contravene his will.
p15498
aVHer heart rebelled, though\u000aher fingers obeyed.
p15499
aVOh, if he could but be pushed away--banished\u000asomewhere out of her sphere, never to be seen again.
p15500
aVHis laugh was\u000aintolerable; his look more intolerable still.
p15501
aVSome time or other, she\u000afelt, she would say to him, before them all, \u201cDon\u2019t look at me, don\u2019t\u000atake me into your confidence.
p15502
aVI will not have your confidence.\u201d She knew\u000awhat he would do if she were driven to such a folly.
p15503
aVHe would open his\u000aeyes wide and appeal to Gussy to know what was the matter.
p15504
aV\u201cHave I said\u000aanything to Miss Summerhayes that could convey that idea?\u201d he would ask\u000awith the most guileless innocence.
p15505
aVAnd Janet knew that there would be\u000anothing to reply.
p15506
aVAll this was while he had not remembered, while the events of that night\u000ahad not returned to his mind.
p15507
aVBut they would return, she felt sure, as\u000ahe got stronger.
p15508
aVHe would remember everything--the share she had in it,\u000aand Dolff\u2019s face in his passion.
p15509
aVOh, dreadful thought!
p15510
aVfor then what\u000awould he do?
p15511
aVCHAPTER XXXVII.
p15512
aVIT was not till a few days after this that Meredith\u2019s growing strength\u000apermitted a reference to the circumstances of his \u201cillness,\u201d as they all\u000acalled it, which, of course, was not at all concerted, but occurred\u000aquite unintentionally in the course of the conversation.
p15513
aVOne or two\u000athings had been said before he took any part in the talk himself.
p15514
aVAt\u000alength, rousing himself from a sort of reverie, he said.
p15515
aV\u201cHow was it, I wonder, that I was so lucky as to be knocked down at your\u000adoor?
p15516
aVWhoever the man was, he did me a good turn there; but how was it\u000athat I was found at your door?
p15517
aVIt was not in the evening, you say--which\u000awould have explained itself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was about five o\u2019clock,\u201d said Julia, suddenly interposing.
p15518
aVShe had\u000atreasured up all the details in her mind.
p15519
aV\u201cAbout five o\u2019clock!\u201d said Meredith, looking round him with elevated\u000aeyebrows.
p15520
aV\u201cNow, tell me, some one, what could I be doing at five o\u2019clock\u000aat this door?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd you were expected to dinner at half-past seven,\u201d said Julia again.
p15521
aV\u201cEvidently,\u201d said Meredith, \u201cshe has entered into the mystery of the\u000asituation.
p15522
aVWhat was I doing at five o\u2019clock, being expected at half-past\u000aseven, at this door?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have often thought of it,\u201d said Gussy, \u201cand wondered if you were\u000acoming to say you could not come to dinner.
p15523
aVYou had clients who stopped\u000ayou several times before.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe gave her a glance and laughed, but Gussy was quite unsuspicious, and\u000ainstanced the clients in perfect good faith.
p15524
aV\u201cPoor clients!\u201d he said; \u201cthey have been left to themselves for a long\u000atime, but they don\u2019t seem to have been clamoring for me.
p15525
aVI don\u2019t think\u000ait could be that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPerhaps you were going to call somewhere in the neighborhood,\u201d\u000asuggested Mrs. Harwood.
p15526
aV\u201cI don\u2019t think it could be that either--I don\u2019t make many calls, and\u000anone about here.
p15527
aVTry again.
p15528
aVI must find it out.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet on this occasion was seated full in view.
p15529
aVShe had not been able to\u000achange her position, as she generally did when he was brought in.
p15530
aVShe\u000adid not look up or take any notice.
p15531
aVBut Janet was aware that her head\u000awas bent stiffly, not naturally, over her work, and that in her whole\u000aappearance there must be the rigor of an artificial pose.
p15532
aVHer head was\u000abent lower than it need to have been; her needle stumbled in her work,\u000apricking her fingers; and her downcast face, in spite of her, was\u000acovered with a hot and angry flush.
p15533
aVAnd he could see her, plainly,\u000adistinctly, near him as she had not allowed herself to be since before\u000a\u201cthe accident\u201d had occurred.
p15534
aVHe did not take any notice for a little\u000atime, being apparently much engaged with his own thoughts; but presently\u000ahe looked up, and caught the expression of both form and face as she sat\u000ain the full light of the window.
p15535
aVOh, that it should have so happened\u000ato-day, instead of on any of the preceding days in which it would have\u000abeen of no consequence!
p15536
aVJanet, through her drooping eyelashes, saw--as\u000ashe could have seen, somehow, had he been behind her--a slight start and\u000aawakening in his face: and then he put up his hand to support his head,\u000aand fixed his eyes upon her under that shield.
p15537
aV\u201cYou are tired, Charley!\u201d she heard Miss Harwood saying.
p15538
aV\u201cNo, no; not tired a bit, only thinking.\u201d\u000a\u000aHis thinking was done with his eyes fixed on Janet, reading (she was\u000asure) the dreadful consciousness which she felt to be in her.
p15539
aVShe\u000awaited, trembling, for his next words.
p15540
aV\u201cI think,\u201d he said, \u201ca light begins to dawn upon me.
p15541
aVI had been at\u000aMimpriss\u2019s, the library; I suppose on my usual quest for music.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet did not know what might come next.
p15542
aVShe had seen various glances directed towards her which made her think\u000ahe would not spare her.
p15543
aVShe had made it a principle to forestall\u000aeverything that could be said about herself.
p15544
aV\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said, hastily, \u201cnow I remember!
p15545
aVI saw Mr. Meredith\u000athere.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou never said so before, Janet.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think I must have said so, the first evening.
p15546
aVSince then nobody has\u000athought of such details.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe looked at her doubtfully, with some vagueness.
p15547
aV\u201cNow I begin to recollect,\u201d he said; \u201cI was at Mimpriss\u2019s, and walked\u000aalong, because it was his way home, with--a man I met: and then--yes,\u000aI\u2019m beginning to remember.
p15548
aVIn a little time I shall have it all clear.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe fixed his eyes upon her again under the shelter of his hand.
p15549
aVHow they\u000aseemed to burn into her!
p15550
aVShe sat quite still, unnaturally still, with\u000aher eyes fixed upon her work.
p15551
aVOh, how they burned, those eyes!
p15552
aVthey\u000aseemed to make holes in her, to reach her heart.
p15553
aVBut this was as far as\u000ahe had gone as yet.
p15554
aVHe was beginning to see her in the shops, on the\u000apavement by his side--talking to him.
p15555
aVUnder the cover of his hand he\u000akept asking her,\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat more?
p15556
aVWhat more?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou don\u2019t remember with whom it was you were walking?\u201d said Gussy\u000abreathlessly.
p15557
aV\u201cHush, I\u2019m thinking--it is coming, very vaguely, like a thing in the\u000adark.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJanet, perhaps you saw what sort of man it was with whom Mr. Meredith\u000awas walking?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo,\u201d said Janet.
p15558
aVShe was unable to form more than this one word: and\u000ashe never looked at him, but stumbled on at her work, steadying her\u000ahands with a tremendous effort.
p15559
aVHe saw well enough the perturbation in which she was, though none of the\u000aothers might remark it; and she saw how he looked at her.
p15560
aVNow the smile\u000abroke out again, more malicious than ever.
p15561
aV\u201cNo,\u201d said Meredith, \u201cI don\u2019t suppose Miss Summerhayes would see him.
p15562
aVI\u000amust have met him some time after she saw me at the shop.
p15563
aVBut I begin to\u000aget hold of it all.
p15564
aVIt was a dark night, and the lamps were lighted.
p15565
aVMy\u000afriend must surely have left me----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI was about to say,\u201d cried Gussy, \u201che could not have been with you\u000athere, or he must have come in with you, and told us how it was.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere was nobody with me, then?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNobody, except the man who picked you up and the policeman, who is\u000aalways coming back to say he\u2019s on the track of the murderer.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe murderer!
p15566
aVThat gives one an uncomfortable conviction, as if one had\u000areally been killed.
p15567
aVI have a kind of vision of a face.
p15568
aVWhen does this\u000apoliceman generally come?
p15569
aVI should like to have a talk with him.
p15570
aVHe\u000amight throw some light upon my very dim recollection.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDolff is the one who sees him when he comes,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood.
p15571
aV\u201cI did\u000anot, myself, feel equal to it; and Dolff seemed the right person.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh, yes; and so kind of him,\u201d said Meredith.
p15572
aV\u201cI have been surrounded\u000awith true kindness.
p15573
aVDolff, please come and tell me--what does the\u000apoliceman say?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot much,\u201d said Dolff, from the dark corner in which he had established\u000ahimself.
p15574
aVMeredith turned half round towards him.
p15575
aV\u201cIs the fellow any good?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo good at all,\u201d cried Dolff.
p15576
aV\u201cHe has always a new cock-and-bull story.
p15577
aVHe is no good.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd none of you in the house saw anything?\u201d Meredith said.
p15578
aV\u201cWell, Charley, it was night.
p15579
aVThere was nobody at the window; and, had\u000athere been, they could have seen nothing.
p15580
aVWe did not even hear much.
p15581
aVIt\u000amust all have been done very quickly.
p15582
aVMy dears,\u201d cried Mrs. Harwood,\u000awith a shiver, \u201chow can we be thankful enough!
p15583
aVYou might have been\u000akilled, Charley.
p15584
aVA minute more, and they say there would have been no\u000ahope.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven Meredith was respectful enough to be silent for a moment.
p15585
aVBut he\u000aresumed immediately,\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is strange that no one should have seen anything.
p15586
aVI should have\u000athought--And who opened the door?
p15587
aVDid anyone ring to get in?
p15588
aVHow was it?
p15589
aVPerhaps that would help me to pull my thoughts together.
p15590
aVSome one must\u000ahave rung the bell; some good Samaritan.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo.
p15591
aVIt was Vicars who heard something, and ran to see what it was,\u201d\u000asaid Gussy.
p15592
aV\u201cVicars is very quick-eared.
p15593
aVHe runs whenever there is any\u000acommotion.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh!\u201d said Meredith again.
p15594
aVHe put up his hand once more to cover his eyes, and under his regard\u000aJanet for the first time broke down.
p15595
aVShe got up hastily and threw her\u000awork from her.
p15596
aV\u201cShall I make the tea, Mrs. Harwood?\u201d she said, in a trembling voice.
p15597
aV\u201cPoor Janet,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood.
p15598
aV\u201cShe has never quite got over it.
p15599
aVIt\u000amade such an impression upon her nerves.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think,\u201d said Gussy, \u201cit might have made more impression upon my\u000anerves than upon Janet\u2019s.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, please don\u2019t think of my nerves,\u201d said Janet.
p15600
aV\u201cIf you will let me,\u000aI will pour out the tea.\u201d\u000a\u000aMeredith said nothing.
p15601
aVHe was following out, with his brain still a\u000alittle confused, the clue he had got hold of.
p15602
aVIt was Janet, certainly it\u000awas Janet.
p15603
aVHe read it in every line of her stiffened figure and\u000aconscious countenance, and in the overwhelming agitation which had at\u000alast triumphed over her self-control.
p15604
aVYes, he had met her in the\u000alibrary, and it was with her he had walked towards the ambush laid for\u000ahim.
p15605
aVWhat more?
p15606
aVWas there anything more?
p15607
aVHe had in his mind a vague\u000areminiscence of something else which he had seen, which a little more\u000athinking would perhaps enable him to master.
p15608
aVShe must have seen what\u000ahappened if it was she who was with him, as he believed.
p15609
aVShe must be\u000aaware, if not who it was that had assaulted him, at least how it was.
p15610
aVHe\u000akept on thinking while they talked round him, trying to quicken his own\u000afeeble brain into action, and saying to himself that she must know.
p15611
aVIf\u000ashe knew, why was she silent?
p15612
aVThen it occurred to Meredith what the\u000areason was.
p15613
aVHe glanced at Gussy, sitting by him, and even upon his face there came a\u000acertain uneasy color.
p15614
aVBetray to Gussy his _rendezvous_ with Janet!
p15615
aVAh,\u000ahe understood now why Janet did not speak.
p15616
aVShe dared not.
p15617
aVShe must have\u000astolen indoors somehow, and concealed the fact that she had ever been\u000aout.
p15618
aVIt would be her ruin to make her confess.
p15619
aVPerhaps Meredith would\u000anot have cared so very much for this, if it had not appeared to him that\u000ahe himself would cut but an indifferent figure--paying his addresses to\u000athe daughter of the house, and intriguing with the governess?
p15620
aVHe went\u000aover the same ground which Janet had already traversed, and he confessed\u000ato himself that it would not do.
p15621
aVBut what was this consciousness in his\u000amind that he knew, or had known something more?
p15622
aV\u201cBring Charley his tea, Dolff,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood.
p15623
aV\u201cI am sure he wants\u000ahis tea.
p15624
aVIt is a nice habit for a man, which I hope you will keep up,\u000aCharley, when you are well.
p15625
aVI always like to see a young man find\u000apleasure in his tea.\u201d\u000a\u000aHer soft voice ran on while Dolff very unwillingly, and with averted\u000aface, carried the tea to Meredith.
p15626
aVWhat was it that this dark, stormy,\u000ahalf-averted face suggested to the sick man?
p15627
aVDolff leaned over him for a\u000amoment, very unwillingly holding out the tea to him, offering him cake\u000aand bread-and-butter, which simple dainties were now part of the\u000ainvalid\u2019s regimen.
p15628
aVMeredith caught that view of Dolff\u2019s face with a\u000acertain shock, with a quickened interest, almost anxiety.
p15629
aVWhat did it\u000amean?
p15630
aVThere was something which he recollected, which he could not\u000arecollect--some fact that might throw light upon everything.
p15631
aVHe was\u000astartled beyond measure by the sight of Dolff\u2019s face Dolff!
p15632
aVthere could\u000abe nothing in him to excite anyone.
p15633
aVWhy was it that his heart began to\u000abeat at the sight of Dolff?
p15634
aVHe could not make it out--it had something\u000ato do with his accident.
p15635
aVWhat was it.
p15636
aVBut presently Meredith felt his\u000ahead begin to ache and his brain to swim.
p15637
aVHe leaned back upon his\u000apillows with a sigh of impatience.
p15638
aVGussy was standing by his side in a\u000amoment asking,\u000a\u000a\u201cWas he tired--did he feel giddy?\u201d\u000a\u000aMeredith answered with a disappointment and petulance, which in his weak\u000astate nearly moved him to tears,\u000a\u000a\u201cI can\u2019t think, that is the worst of it.
p15639
aVI begin to remember a trifle\u000ahere and there.
p15640
aVI have got the length of remembering who was with me,\u000aand I know there is something more.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t try to think any more--leave it till to-morrow.
p15641
aVYou know,\u201d said\u000aGussy, \u201cdear Charley, the doctors say it will come all right; but you\u000amust do it justice, and not force it.
p15642
aVThere is no hurry, is there?
p15643
aVYou\u000aare not obliged to begin working directly again.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, I\u2019m not obliged to begin working,\u201d Meredith said.
p15644
aVIt was not necessary to enter into explanations, and to tell her how his\u000amind was occupied.
p15645
aVAnd, as a matter of fact, he remained very quiet all\u000anext day _en attendant_ the great event and privilege of being allowed\u000ato walk across the hall to the drawing-room, and disport himself from\u000achair to chair at his pleasure.
p15646
aVFrom time to time during the day he did,\u000aindeed, take up the broken thread where it had dropped from him and try\u000ato tack it on to something.
p15647
aVBut he could not do it.
p15648
aVHe traced himself\u000aalong the road from Mimpriss\u2019s with Janet on his arm, in the faint\u000alamplight; but at the door he found himself stopped short.
p15649
aVOne word more\u000awould complete the task--one link and he would know all about it, as\u000aJanet did, who would never say what it was: but upon that link he could\u000anot get hold.
p15650
aVThe event of the afternoon was accomplished with great success.
p15651
aVHe\u000awalked unassisted, though feeling as if his legs did not quite belong to\u000ahim, into the drawing-room, the ladies rising to receive and admire him,\u000aas if he had been a child taking its first walk.
p15652
aV\u201cWhy, he\u2019s a perfect Hercules!\u201d cried Mrs. Harwood.
p15653
aV\u201cHe walks as well as\u000aany of you.
p15654
aVThank God, my dear boy, that you have got on so well.
p15655
aVI\u000athink we may feel that you are out of the wood now.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, don\u2019t encourage him too much, mamma!
p15656
aVHe won\u2019t be kept down.
p15657
aVHe is\u000atoo venturesome.
p15658
aVFancy, nurse tells me that he has been\u000athinking--actually thinking all day.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow very unguarded of him!\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, with a laugh.
p15659
aVAnd then\u000athe usual circle was made round him, and the tea poured out to refresh\u000ahim after his exertion.
p15660
aVIt was while the bread-and-butter was going round that Priscilla, the\u000aparlor-maid, came into the room which was so pleasant with firelight and\u000asmiling faces, and announced that the detective wanted to speak to the\u000agentleman--Dolff\u2019s name was very well known since this inquiry had\u000abegun, but it was still to \u201cthe gentleman\u201d that this official asked to\u000aspeak.
p15661
aV\u201cHe thinks he has found out something now,\u201d said Priscilla with a faint\u000asniff of scepticism.
p15662
aVPriscilla sensibly thought that a man who had been on this job for so\u000along and had discovered nothing was a poor creature indeed.
p15663
aV\u201cWho is the gentleman that is wanted?\u201d said Meredith.
p15664
aV\u201cIt is Dolff, I\u000asuppose, as the man of the house.
p15665
aVBut why should Dolff be bored with\u000athis?--it is my business if ever any business was.
p15666
aVMrs. Harwood, may we\u000ahave him in here?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCertainly, Charley--if you are quite sure that you can stand it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I stand it?
p15667
aVI am quite well.
p15668
aVI don\u2019t even feel weak.
p15669
aVLet\u000aus have him in here.\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Harwood looked at Gussy and Gussy looked at the patient.
p15670
aV\u201cI am very much afraid it will try him, mamma.
p15671
aVStill, as he would hear\u000athe voices in the hall, which might excite him more----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOf course it would excite me more.
p15672
aVThanks, my kindest Gussy, though you\u000ascold me, you are always on my side.\u201d\u000a\u000aHere Dolff spoke from the corner in which during these _sances_ he\u000aalways took shelter.
p15673
aV\u201cThis is a new man,\u201d he said.
p15674
aV\u201cHe\u2019s always got a different thing to\u000asuggest, and it\u2019s very distracting--hadn\u2019t I better see him this time?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think Dolff is right,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood.
p15675
aV\u201cNo,\u201d said Meredith, \u201cI want distraction.
p15676
aVLet\u2019s have him here.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe did not omit to note the fact that Dolff retired further still into\u000ahis corner as the policeman came in.
p15677
aVThe detective, who was in plain clothes, but not a lofty member of his\u000aprofession, made a sweeping bow all round, and looked a little\u000aembarrassed as he found himself among a company of ladies.
p15678
aVHe looked\u000around for Dolff, whom he knew, and then at the stranger in the centre of\u000athe group, whom he had never seen before, but who distinctly assumed the\u000aprincipal place.
p15679
aV\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t see the gentleman I\u2019ve seen\u000abefore.
p15680
aVOh!--yes--I beg your pardon.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe turned again to the corner, from which Dolff had emerged a little.
p15681
aV\u201cYou needn\u2019t mind me,\u201d said Dolff, \u201cthere is the gentleman who is most\u000ainterested, Mr. Meredith.\u201d\u000a\u000aMeredith had his eyes fixed on Dolff.
p15682
aVThe young man was like a\u000athunderstorm, dark, heavy, and lowering, his eyelids half covering his\u000aeyes, his shoulders shrugged up, his head down between them.
p15683
aVA vague\u000alight was breaking upon the question.
p15684
aVAt this moment Dolff stooped down\u000ato recover something he had dropped.
p15685
aVMeredith uttered a quick, low cry.
p15686
aV\u201cWhat is it?
p15687
aVWhat is it?
p15688
aVThis is too much for you Charley,\u201d said Gussy.
p15689
aVHis eyes were fixed on Dolff in the corner.
p15690
aVThey were widening and\u000abrightening, the iris dilating, the eyes almost projecting, or seeming\u000ato project, with the intensity of his gaze.
p15691
aV\u201cAh!\u201d he said, with a long-drawn breath.
p15692
aVHe had found it at last--the thing which he had remembered yet could not\u000aremember.
p15693
aVJanet\u2019s eyes, drawn to him with a sort of fascination, divined\u000awhat it meant, and her heart sank.
p15694
aVGussy, who had no such prescience,\u000athought only of excitement and fatigue to her patient.
p15695
aV\u201cOh, what is it?
p15696
aVyou are overdone?\u201d she said.
p15697
aV\u201cYou must do nothing more\u000ato-day.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen he turned to her he had a smile on his lips.
p15698
aV\u201cI am not overdone,\u201d he said, \u201con the contrary, I have made great\u000aprogress.
p15699
aVI have got new light.
p15700
aVI have got back my memory, and now I\u000aremember everything.
p15701
aVPray, Dolff,\u201d he said, quietly, \u201cdon\u2019t go away.
p15702
aVYou\u000amust help us with your experience.\u201d And he laughed--a laugh full of\u000amockery, which somehow, to two at least of the persons present, seemed\u000alike a death-knell.
p15703
aVDolff, who had made a step or two towards the door, stopped with an\u000aobedience too ready and complete.
p15704
aVHe saw the change in Meredith\u2019s face,\u000aand felt that the hour of vengeance which he had, he thought, eluded,\u000awas now about to come.
p15705
aVHe cast a dull glance at Janet, half of appeal,\u000ahalf of despair--and saw that she thought as he did, and was holding her\u000abreath in intense attention.
p15706
aVShe understood, but did not sympathize.
p15707
aVShe\u000awould not stand by him now, he felt instinctively, though she had stood\u000aby him before.
p15708
aV\u201cWell,\u201d said Meredith, \u201cexcuse me, I have kept you too long waiting.
p15709
aVYou\u000aare after the fellow who knocked me down, officer--have you got any\u000atrace?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, sir,\u201d said the policeman, \u201cyou might say nearly murdered you.
p15710
aVI\u2019m\u000aglad to see you so well again.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThanks,\u201d said Meredith, \u201cas I\u2019m so well, we\u2019ll say only knocked me\u000adown: and if he hadn\u2019t taken me at a disadvantage in coming up behind\u000ame, I suppose I ought to have been able to give a good account of him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh!\u201d said the policeman, \u201cone of those fellows he wouldn\u2019t face a\u000agentleman like you.
p15711
aVI\u2019m sorry to say we\u2019ve no trace of him--nothing as I\u000acould act upon: but I\u2019ve got the man as saw it from the other side of\u000athe street, and he says he could pick out the man from any dozen.
p15712
aVHe\u000asays he would know his face again wherever he saw him; he\u2019s got a\u000anotion, besides, of where the fellow\u2019s to be found.
p15713
aVI was thinking as\u000ayou might like to question him yourself; I have got him just round the\u000acorner, waiting with one of my mates, if you\u2019d like to see him\u000ayourself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh!\u201d said Meredith, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing.
p15714
aVWhat do you say,\u000aDolff?
p15715
aVDon\u2019t you think we might have this man--who could recognize the\u000acad who hit me behind my back, here?\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff\u2019s tongue clove to the roof of his mouth.
p15716
aVHe stood in his corner,\u000aand glanced at the speaker, but did not answer a word.
p15717
aV\u201cI could have him here in a moment,\u201d the policeman said.
p15718
aV\u201cIt would be interesting,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, \u201cbut a little exciting;\u000aand, if he saw him so well, why didn\u2019t he secure him there and then?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHis attention, ma\u2019am, was called off by the gentleman as he thought was\u000adying; but I don\u2019t think as it is too late.\u201d\u000a\u000aDid the detective glance into the corner too, at Dolff standing in dark\u000ashadow against the wall?
p15719
aV\u201cI am only afraid it will be too much for you in your weak state,\u201d said\u000aGussy, looking anxiously at her patient.
p15720
aV\u201cWe\u2019ll let Dolff decide,\u201d said Meredith, with once more that dreadful\u000alaugh.
p15721
aV\u201cCome, give us your advice, as you have had all the previous\u000ainformation.
p15722
aVShall we have this man in who can identify--the murderer,\u000aDolff?\u201d\u000a\u000aThere was a pause, which even to the unsuspecting ladies had something\u000adreadful in it.
p15723
aVDolff cleared his throat and moistened his parched lips.
p15724
aV\u201cYou can have him--if you wish it, I suppose?\u201d he said.
p15725
aVThe crisis, however, passed off for the moment in an unexpected way--for\u000aMeredith\u2019s strength suddenly forsook him, and he had to be taken back to\u000ahis room in something very like a faint.
p15726
aVCHAPTER XXXVIII.
p15727
aVRemembering is a very slow progress when your mind is confused by\u000aserious illness, weakness, and the breaking off for a time of all\u000athreads of meaning in the mind.
p15728
aVMeredith took it up again in the\u000amorning, though not with the momentary gleam of conviction which had\u000aflashed upon him; and he worked very hard at it, as he might have worked\u000aat a case in his practice for the Bar or a mathematical problem.
p15729
aVBut it\u000awas harder than either of those.
p15730
aVHe made out easily enough his meeting\u000awith Janet at Mimpriss\u2019s, and guessed rather than remembered that he had\u000awalked home with her, and thus exposed himself to being knocked down at\u000aMrs. Harwood\u2019s door; but he did not make out until he had returned to\u000athe question--his faculties freshened by a night\u2019s sleep, and the new\u000aenergy of the morning--why it was that he had met Janet, or that there\u000awas any special reason for their meeting.
p15731
aVIt flashed upon him all at\u000aonce that he had made the appointment; that he had written to her to ask\u000aher to meet him; and then he remembered all at once the papers and the\u000amystery which the papers had thrown so little light upon.
p15732
aVHe half\u000astarted from his couch with excitement when it burst upon him that he\u000awas under the same roof as the mysterious recluse in the wing: and thus\u000alaid himself open to a grave reproof from his attendant, who called upon\u000ahim to recollect that he had been very ill, that his escape was\u000ahalf-miraculous, and that to put his health in jeopardy by suffering\u000ahimself to get excited would be \u201cmore than criminal.\u201d He believed that\u000ashe meant scarcely less than criminal, but he was humble, and expressed\u000athe deepest penitence.
p15733
aV\u201cI was only thinking,\u201d he said, \u201cand something suddenly flashed upon\u000ame.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThinking is the very worst thing you could do,\u201d said the nurse,\u000aseverely, \u201cand to have things flashing upon you is what I cannot allow.
p15734
aVIf it occurs again I must appeal to the doctor.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe nurse was a lady, so that he could not quench her as he would have\u000adone had she been Mrs. Gamp, and had to apologize again.
p15735
aVBut the\u000acompulsory pause did him good, for when he returned to the subject\u000awithout any more starts and flashes, it all became clear to him again\u000afrom the night of the ball upwards.
p15736
aVThe various events of that night\u000acame back like a picture to his mind.
p15737
aVIt had occupied him entirely in\u000athe short intervals that occurred between that discovery and the assault\u000aupon him at Mrs. Harwood\u2019s door.
p15738
aVSince then he had remembered nothing\u000aabout it till now.
p15739
aVAnd now: he was under the same roof--he would have, as he got better and\u000abetter, unbounded opportunities of finding out what that mystery was.
p15740
aVThe couch was now to be altogether discarded.
p15741
aVHe was to be allowed to\u000awalk and to sit in a chair like other people.
p15742
aVVicars the mysterious\u000awould be under his eye, and Mrs. Harwood--and Gussy in her present\u000acondition, softened with anxiety for him, and joy in his recovery, would\u000adisclose anything he might ask from her.
p15743
aVHe knew that she could not keep\u000aany secret from him now--if it were a secret she knew.
p15744
aVHe felt greatly elated by the idea of the discovery which was so near,\u000awhich lay under his hand, which he must be able to complete with his\u000apresent advantages, and the thought of it led him very far on.
p15745
aVTrue, he\u000ahad almost forgotten Janet and the immediate yet lesser problem which he\u000ahad to solve, _i.e._, how he came to be knocked down and almost killed\u000aat Mrs. Harwood\u2019s, and who had done it.
p15746
aVHe left the other subject with a\u000asigh and came back to this again for the moment.
p15747
aVYes, he had received\u000afrom Janet the papers which she had put together for him--received them,\u000ahe remembered, without a word, which had piqued and made him resolve to\u000acompromise Janet, and show her what a farce it was to be demure with\u000ahim--at least, to compromise Janet as much as he could without\u000acompromising himself.
p15748
aVIt was for that reason, he remembered, that he\u000ainsisted upon going all the way with and talking to her as only a lover\u000ahad any right to do--for that reason, and also because she had a great\u000aattraction for him, far more than Gussy had ever had.
p15749
aVHe began to\u000arecollect even the things she had said--her little struggles against his\u000aappropriation of her, her gradually yielding--all that is most\u000adelightful for a suitor of his kind to recollect.
p15750
aVHe liked to feel himself the cause of emotion in others--he smiled as he\u000athought of it.
p15751
aVPoor little Janet; she was angry and she was horrified.
p15752
aVShe felt probably that it was she who had brought him into the great\u000adanger under which he had fallen, and she was desperate to see that his\u000aillness had separated them more than ever, and made Gussy mistress of\u000athe situation.
p15753
aVHe forgave her, therefore, for her averted looks and\u000aunyielding face.
p15754
aVShe must know how it had all come about.
p15755
aVHe was certain\u000afrom her looks that she knew, but she would not betray herself by\u000atelling, and he would not betray her by forcing her to tell, for in that\u000acase he would betray himself too.
p15756
aVWho could it be, he again asked himself, who had fallen upon him, and\u000aassaulted him in that terrible way?
p15757
aVMeredith was not conscious of having\u000aenemies of that old-fashioned kind.
p15758
aVThere might be plenty of men who did\u000anot like him, as there were plenty of men whom he did not like; but\u000abetween that and trying to murder him there was a great difference.
p15759
aVHe\u000awas not a man of the highest morals, perhaps, but he did not inflict\u000ainjuries which would give any man a right to fling himself upon him in\u000athis way.
p15760
aVIt was a new idea to think that it might be a lover of\u000aJanet\u2019s: but what lover could Janet have--some young fellow from the\u000acountry, perhaps, driven frantic by seeing his beloved in such close\u000acolloquy with another man.
p15761
aVMeredith\u2019s reason, however, rejected this hypothesis.
p15762
aVThe young man\u000afrom the country would not be such a tragical fool as to rush upon an\u000aunknown stranger and try to murder him solely because that stranger was\u000awalking home with his sweetheart.
p15763
aVNo!
p15764
aVand besides, he remembered\u000asomething--something which had been presented to his intelligence at the\u000avery last moment before that intelligence was temporarily\u000aquenched--something--what was it that he remembered?
p15765
aVIt was all\u000aperfectly clear up to this point.
p15766
aVHe saw every step as distinctly as if\u000ait were in a case he had studied from a brief, but here the evidence\u000abroke down.
p15767
aVAnd yet it was lying somewhere in a corner of his mind if he\u000acould only get at it.
p15768
aVHe knew that it was there.
p15769
aV\u201cHow is our patient to-day?\u201d said Gussy, coming in, with the privilege\u000aof her long nursing, after Meredith had made his toilette, and was lying\u000aon the sofa to rest after that operation.
p15770
aVThe nurse shook her head.
p15771
aV\u201cOur patient,\u201d she said, \u201chas been thinking.
p15772
aVHe has been using his mind\u000aa great deal too much--he has been smiling to himself and knitting his\u000abrows as if he were trying to remember something.
p15773
aVYou will please to\u000atell him, Miss Harwood, that this sort of thing will not do.
p15774
aVI have done\u000aso, but he does not mind me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow cruel of you to say so!\u201d said Meredith, \u201cwhen you know that I mind\u000ayou in everything!
p15775
aVI never take an invigorating glass of soda-water\u000awithout asking you if I may.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe shook her head again.
p15776
aV\u201cIt is not glasses of soda-water that are in question, but using your\u000ahead, Mr. Meredith, when it\u2019s not in a fit state.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWith two or three holes in it,\u201d said Meredith, ruefully.
p15777
aV\u201cNo; you must not,\u201d said Gussy, soothing him.
p15778
aV\u201cI am glad you think you\u000ahave found a clue, but that is enough for to-day.\u201d\u000a\u000aYes, it was enough for to-day; he was compelled in his weakness to\u000aacknowledge that he could do no more.
p15779
aV\u201cAnd you must not think.
p15780
aVYou must not even attempt to think,\u201d said\u000aGussy; \u201cthinking is not a thing for you to do.
p15781
aVPromise me you will not\u000atry.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe took her hand to reassure her, but he did not promise, and even in\u000athe act of holding Gussy\u2019s hand and looking up tenderly into her face in\u000arequital of her care, he glanced round to make sure that Janet saw this\u000alittle affectionate episode.
p15782
aVHe wished her to see, with a sense of pique\u000aat the indifference she had shown, and a desire that she should be made\u000aaware how little her indifference was shared by others.
p15783
aVIn his weak\u000astate it was doubly necessary to him to be surrounded by care and\u000aattention, to have love to wait upon and consider him in all things.
p15784
aVHe\u000awas pleased for himself to caress and be caressed, but he loved to have\u000aa spectator to whom he could make those little traitorous asides which\u000aincreased his enjoyment, or whom he could at least mortify with the\u000asight of his entire mastery over some one else if he had ceased to move\u000aher.
p15785
aVBut, though this little play with the feelings of others pleased him, he\u000adid not give up on that account the quest upon which his mind had\u000aentered.
p15786
aVMeredith had no inclination to let off or pardon the offender\u000awho had so nearly taken his life.
p15787
aVWhoever it might be, he was determined\u000ato hunt him out and punish him.
p15788
aVAnd he only relinquished this, the\u000aprocess in his mind of putting together such evidence as he had got\u000apossession of and working it out, as he might have put aside any piece\u000aof manual work till his fatigue had passed away and he was able to take\u000ait up again.
p15789
aVIt would not do to throw himself back by getting a\u000aheadache, by injuring his nerves or his sleep.
p15790
aVHis mind was sufficiently\u000atrained to enable him to do this; to put thoughts aside when they hurt\u000ahim, to take them back again when he was in a fit state to do so--which\u000ais a capacity always very astonishing to those who have never learned to\u000adiscipline and rule their thoughts.
p15791
aVJanet thought with relief that whatever suspicions may have gleamed\u000aacross him, whatever half recollections might have formed in his mind,\u000athey had passed away like clouds, when she saw him submitting to all\u000aGussy\u2019s half-nurse, half-lover attentions, leaning back upon his\u000apillows, suffering himself to be silenced and soothed, smiling upon his\u000aanxious ministrant, and professing to do everything she told him.
p15792
aV\u201cWas there ever so docile a slave?\u201d he said; \u201cI have no will but my\u000alady\u2019s.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou mean patient,\u201d said Gussy, with the soft flush that lit up her\u000aface, \u201cand it is your nurse whom you obey.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFortunately the two things are the same in my case,\u201d he said.
p15793
aVTo think that he could indulge in this badinage while his mind was still\u000afollowing out the thread upon which another man\u2019s life hung, was\u000aincredible to Janet.
p15794
aVShe thought it had all passed from his mind, and\u000athat she and her secret, and, still more, Dolff and his, must now be\u000asafe.
p15795
aVAnd presently she was asked to go again and play for the soothing\u000aof the invalid, a request which she obeyed with suppressed indignation.
p15796
aVWhy should she be made to minister to him too--she whose eyes had been\u000aopened, who had just escaped, or hoped that she had escaped from him,\u000aalmost at the risk of her life?
p15797
aVJanet was impatient of him, and half\u000adisappointed after the excitement into which his tentative questions and\u000alooks had thrown her, that he had let it drop again and float off in\u000anothingness.
p15798
aVShe was quieted in her fears, but she almost resented it,\u000aand despised the man who had so little nerve and force left.
p15799
aVJanet was wrong, it need scarcely be said.
p15800
aVMeredith retired a little\u000aearlier than usual on the pretence of being tired.
p15801
aVHe lay very still in\u000athe quiet of his room, which nobody but the nurse was now permitted to\u000aenter, till his headache was quite gone, and then he returned to the\u000asearch of his own mind and recollections, and to the finding out of the\u000asomething which he remembered, yet for the moment had forgot.
p15802
aVCHAPTER XXXIX.
p15803
aVIt all came back like lightning when the policeman came once more.
p15804
aVThe\u000afamily party were almost as before, when the man was announced again,\u000abringing back the former excitement.
p15805
aVNo one noticed when Dolff stole out of the room.
p15806
aVThe lamps had not been\u000abrought in, though the afternoon had become dark.
p15807
aVThe fire glowed, but\u000agave no flame.
p15808
aVBut it is wrong to say that no one noticed.
p15809
aVJanet did not\u000alose a movement of the unhappy young man, nor did Meredith, though he\u000atook no notice.
p15810
aVMeredith said little: he was struggling with the force\u000aof this new discovery that had flashed upon his mind, and which not only\u000acleared up the knotty point, but put meaning and reason into a business\u000ahitherto incomprehensible to him.
p15811
aVWhen the aspect of Dolff suddenly struck upon his dormant memory and\u000aroused it into keen life, he no longer found any difficulty in\u000aunderstanding the whole matter.
p15812
aVDolff had seen him with Janet, with whom\u000athe lout imagined himself in love.
p15813
aVHe had heard, perhaps, certain words\u000aof the conversation: he had seen the clinging of Janet to Meredith\u2019s\u000aarm, the hands held in his.
p15814
aVMeredith thought he remembered now a figure\u000awith hat drawn down and collar up at the window of Mimpriss\u2019s shop.
p15815
aVIt\u000awas all explicable now; he understood it.
p15816
aVDolff!
p15817
aVIt flashed upon him\u000awithout doubt or uncertainty.
p15818
aVThere was something whimsical, bizarre\u000aabout it which made him laugh.
p15819
aVDolff, whom he had always despised, a\u000arowdy undergraduate, a music-hall man.
p15820
aVDolff, a troublesome boy,\u000awanting even in the matured strength of a man, not his own match in any\u000away.
p15821
aVAnd to think that he had been carried into the house, and nursed\u000awith the profoundest devotion under the same roof with the cub who had\u000atried to take his life.
p15822
aVNobody had the least idea why Meredith laughed.
p15823
aVIt was at the detective,\u000ahe said, though the detective was not ridiculous at all.
p15824
aVAnd this was\u000awhat had changed the looks of Janet, and given her that tranquil air\u000awhich, now he thought of it, was so ludicrous too.
p15825
aVHe had to make an\u000aeffort to restrain that laugh.
p15826
aVAfter the first thrill of anger, Meredith\u000arejected as impossible the punishment of Dolff.
p15827
aVIt was not a thing that\u000acould be done.
p15828
aVSuch a scandal and disturbance of all existing ties was\u000ainexpedient, even for himself--to have it published to the world that he\u000ahad been knocked down and almost killed by the son of the house in which\u000ahe spent most of his evenings, was impossible.
p15829
aVAt all hazards that\u000adanger must be staved off.
p15830
aVBut Meredith saw means of torturing both\u000athose culprits which would be very effectual without any intervention of\u000athe law.
p15831
aVHe would have Dolff at his mercy; he would pierce him with\u000aarrows of ridicule from which it would be impossible for the young man\u000ato defend himself; and Janet, who had forsaken him, who held apart, and\u000aeven played for him, when she was bidden to do so, unwillingly--Janet\u000ashould suffer too.
p15832
aVLights of malice and mockery woke up in Meredith\u2019s eyes.
p15833
aVHe anticipated\u000aa great deal of fun from the appearance of the witness, who, no doubt,\u000awould collapse and come to nothing when inquired into.
p15834
aVMeredith saw\u000anothing but sport in this unthought-of catastrophe.
p15835
aVHe had something of\u000athe feeling of the excited boy who has a cat or a dog to torture.
p15836
aVHe\u000aknew how to tickle Dolff up in the tenderest places, to keep him in a\u000aperpetual ferment of alarm, to hold endless threats over him; and to\u000awatch his writhings would be all the more fun that the fellow would\u000adeserve it all, and more than that if he got his due.
p15837
aVThus delightedly\u000apursuing his revenge, Meredith missed the moment when Dolff withdrew.
p15838
aVBut Janet saw it, with a terror impossible to describe.
p15839
aVShe could not go\u000aafter him or advise him.
p15840
aVSince these miseries had happened, it had\u000abecome her charge to make the tea, and there she sat, conspicuous even\u000ain the fading light, unable to budge.
p15841
aVShe saw the unhappy young man\u000asteal out, and she knew that all kinds of desperate resolves must be in\u000ahis mind.
p15842
aVHe would not have the courage to face it out.
p15843
aVHe would go away\u000aand he would conceal himself--do something to heighten suspicion and\u000amake every guess into certainty.
p15844
aVAnd she could not go after him to warn\u000ahim--to implore him to stand fast!
p15845
aVThe tortures which Meredith had\u000aimagined with such pleasure had begun in Janet\u2019s breast.
p15846
aVDolff got out into the hall in a condition impossible to describe--his\u000alimbs were limp with misery and fear.
p15847
aVGreat drops of perspiration hung\u000aupon his forehead.
p15848
aVHe went blindly to snatch a hat from the stand; then\u000atook his coat, for he was cold with mental agony, and struggled into it.
p15849
aVWhile he was doing this, Vicars suddenly appeared by him, he could not\u000atell how, and laid a hand on his shoulder, which made Dolff jump.
p15850
aVHe\u000adarted back with an oath, and would have that moment turned and fled had\u000anot Vicars caught his arm again.
p15851
aV\u201cMr.
p15852
aVDolff, what\u2019s up?
p15853
aVFor goodness\u2019 sake don\u2019t fly out like this.
p15854
aVThere\u2019s one of those d----d policemen watching on the other side of the\u000aroad.\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff stared wildly in Vicars\u2019s face.
p15855
aV\u201cLet me go,\u201d he said.
p15856
aV\u201cI must go; I don\u2019t care where.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d said Vicars.
p15857
aV\u201cYou\u2019re in some row, Mr. Dolff?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d said Dolff, wildly.
p15858
aV\u201cThat man\u2019s coming back.
p15859
aVIf he\u000acomes back before I\u2019m gone, it\u2019s all up with me, Vicars.
p15860
aVGet out of my\u000away.
p15861
aVI\u2019ll go--by the garden door.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd show yourself to all the women,\u201d said Vicars, \u201cwho\u2019ll tell the\u000afirst word, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s in the garden.\u2019 Mr. Dolff, is it life or death?\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff could not speak.
p15862
aVHe stared dully at his questioner, unable to\u000areply.
p15863
aVThe sound of the outer door pushed open, and men\u2019s footsteps upon\u000athe path, came in like a sort of horrible accompaniment and explanation.
p15864
aVThe perspiration stood in great beads on Dolff\u2019s forehead.
p15865
aVHe tried to\u000amake a bolt at the passage to the garden, which led by the open door of\u000athe kitchen.
p15866
aVThen he drew himself up against the wall, in a half stupor,\u000aas if he could conceal himself so.
p15867
aV\u201cIs it life or death?\u201d said Vicars, in his ear; but Dolff could not\u000aspeak.
p15868
aVHe had a dim vision of the man\u2019s face, of the light swimming in his\u000aeyes, of the knock upon the door of the house, ominous, awful, like a\u000aknell; and then he suddenly found himself drawn into darkness, into a\u000awarm, close atmosphere, beyond the reach of that, or apparently of any\u000aother sound.
p15869
aVPriscilla, always correct, but a little surprised, not knowing how to\u000aaccount for such an invasion of the drawing-room, ushered in the\u000adetective, accompanied by a man in a shabby coat, very inappropriate\u000acertainly to that locality.
p15870
aVMr. Dolff had always spoken to such men in\u000athe hall.
p15871
aVA parlor-maid is, above all things, an aristocrat.
p15872
aVTo have to\u000aintroduce two such persons to her mistress\u2019s presence offended her in\u000aher deepest sense of right and wrong.
p15873
aV\u201cIs this the man?\u201d said Meredith.
p15874
aV\u201cMrs.
p15875
aVHarwood, do you think we might\u000ahave a little light?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPriscilla is bringing in the lamps,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, looking with a\u000alittle suspicion and annoyance at the men, who certainly were much out\u000aof place: a feeling that there was danger in them somehow, though she\u000acould not tell how, crept into her mind.
p15876
aVShe looked anxiously at the dim figures looming against the light, and a\u000athrill of alarm went through her.
p15877
aVWhy did Charley insist on having them\u000ahere?
p15878
aVWhy did not Dolff see them in the hall, as he had done before?
p15879
aVShe\u000ahad never had a policeman in her house; never, except--Trouble and\u000atremor came over her as she sat there growing breathless in her chair.
p15880
aVAs for Gussy, she was insensible to every appeal, to every claim upon\u000aher attention but one.
p15881
aVShe was Meredith\u2019s sick-nurse, watching lest he\u000ashould be over-fatigued, thinking of nothing else.
p15882
aVThere was no help or\u000asupport in her for her mother\u2019s anxieties.
p15883
aVWhen the lamps were brought in matters were no better.
p15884
aVA sort of\u000aRembrandt-like depth of shadow fell upon the two strange figures,\u000athrowing a blackness over the tea-table at which Janet was sitting, and\u000ashowing only the form of Meredith in his chair, which was full within\u000athe influence of the shaded light, and the awkward attitudes of the two\u000amen in the middle of the room.
p15885
aV\u201cSo this is the man who saw me--knocked down?\u201d said Meredith.
p15886
aVHis face,\u000awhich was the central light in that strange picture, was lit up with\u000awhat seemed more like malicious fun than any other sentiment.
p15887
aV\u201cAnd you\u000athink you could identify the fellow who did it?
p15888
aVIs that so?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou may thank your stars as you weren\u2019t killed,\u201d said the new-comer.
p15889
aV\u201cHe meant it, sir, that fellow did.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou think so?
p15890
aVWell, he hasn\u2019t succeeded, you see; and you think you can\u000aidentify him?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAmong a thousand, sir,\u201d said the man.
p15891
aV\u201cJust you put him before me in a\u000acrowd and I\u2019ll pick him out afore you could say----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen why,\u201d said Meredith, \u201chaven\u2019t you done it before now?
p15892
aVHere are\u000athree weeks gone, and plenty of time for him to have got away.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s not got away; I\u2019ve kept my eye upon him, and I have said to the\u000apolice, times and times, as I could lay my hands upon him as soon as\u000aever he was wanted.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI thought,\u201d said Meredith, \u201ca criminal was wanted from the moment he\u000aput himself in the power of the law.
p15893
aVYou should have secured him at\u000aonce; to keep your eye upon a man is not a process known to the law.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t know about the law, sir,\u201d said the man.
p15894
aV\u201cI know that I have\u000abeen ready any day.
p15895
aVI told \u2019em so the very first night, but they\u2019ve\u000anever paid no attention to me--not till this gentleman was put on as\u000aknows me, and knows as he can trust in my word.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes?\u201d said Meredith, solemnly, \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear you can have such good\u000arecommendations.
p15896
aVIs it necessary you should have a thousand to choose\u000afrom before you tell us who my assailant is?--because, you see, it would\u000abe a little difficult to have them in here.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh,\u201d cried the man, angrily, \u201ca deal fewer than a thousand will do--if\u000ayou\u2019ll just collect all there is in the house----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the house!\u201d cried Mrs. Harwood, \u201cbut what is the use of that?
p15897
aVWe\u000aknow beforehand that there is nobody in this house who would lay a\u000afinger----\u201d she stopped with an indefinite choking sensation in her\u000athroat, suddenly perceiving that Dolff had gone away.
p15898
aVIt was not\u000adistinct enough to mean suspicion of Dolff--suspicion of Dolff!
p15899
aVwhat\u000afolly and insanity!
p15900
aVbut why should he have gone away?
p15901
aV\u201cI thought as you said the young gentleman was here,\u201d said the witness,\u000aturning to his guide.
p15902
aV\u201cI told you as you\u2019d never find him when you came\u000aback.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt don\u2019t matter much,\u201d said the other, in a low tone, \u201che can\u2019t go far,\u000athere\u2019s two of my mates outside.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe ladies did not catch the meaning of this colloquy, though it raised\u000athe most bewildering alarm in Mrs. Harwood\u2019s breast.
p15903
aVGussy still thought\u000aof it alone as it affected the health of her beloved.
p15904
aVShe stood by him,\u000aher attention concentrated on him, watching whether he grew pale,\u000awhether he flushed, if he seemed tired.
p15905
aVHer mother\u2019s anxious look\u000aawakened no sympathy in Gussy\u2019s mind.
p15906
aVIf she observed it at all she set\u000ait down to the same cause as made herself anxious, the fear that\u000aMeredith might be over-excited or fatigued.
p15907
aV\u201cDo you want the maids and all?\u201d said Meredith, in his familiar tone of\u000abanter.
p15908
aV\u201cYou don\u2019t think much of me, my good man, if you think I could\u000abe battered like that by--Priscilla, for instance,\u201d he said, turning to\u000aMrs. Harwood with a laugh.
p15909
aV\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking of no Priscilla,\u201d said the man, angrily.
p15910
aV\u201cIf it suits\u000ayou to laugh at it, gentleman, it don\u2019t suit me.
p15911
aVThere\u2019s a reward out.
p15912
aVAnd when I see as clear as I sees you--I should think it _was_ a man,\u000aand a strong one too.
p15913
aVLord, how savage he took you up again and dashed\u000ayour \u2019ead against the pavement!
p15914
aVI should know him anywhere, among a\u000athousand.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCharley,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, faintly, \u201cthere is something dreadful in\u000aall this.
p15915
aVDo you think it could be put off to another time?
p15916
aVor couldn\u2019t\u000athey just go and do their duty, whatever it is, without freezing the\u000ablood in our veins, and,\u201d she added, catching Gussy\u2019s look, \u201cexhausting\u000ayou?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m sorry to trouble the lady, sir,\u201d said the detective.
p15917
aV\u201cI shouldn\u2019t\u000ahave said anything if I could have helped it; but, to tell you the\u000atruth, suspicion does attach to a person in the house.
p15918
aVIf the young\u000agentleman had stayed and faced it, things might have been done quiet.
p15919
aVBut as he\u2019s gone away--I\u2019m sorry, very sorry, to disturb the ladies--but\u000aI\u2019ve got a search-warrant, and I must find my man.
p15920
aVYou\u2019ll explain it to\u000a\u2019em, sir, as I can\u2019t help it, and it was no wish of mine to upset the\u000ahouse.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA search-warrant!
p15921
aVOh, my God!
p15922
aVwhat does he mean?\u201d cried Mrs. Harwood.
p15923
aVShe added, in her bewilderment, \u201cThat could have nothing to do with\u000aCharley,\u201d under her breath.
p15924
aV\u201cI have no more idea than you have,\u201d said Meredith; \u201csome one in this\u000ahouse?
p15925
aVIt must be old Vicars they mean.
p15926
aVCome, my man, don\u2019t be too\u000aabsurd.
p15927
aVIf you think that old fellow could play at pitch-and-toss with\u000ame in the way you describe, you must have a precious poor opinion of me.
p15928
aVBut I suppose Vicars can be sent for--if he\u2019s in the house.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t know nothing about Vicars, nor who he is.
p15929
aVWhere\u2019s that young\u000agentleman?
p15930
aVWhat did he go away for when he knew as he was wanted?
p15931
aVYou\u000aproduce that young gentleman, and then you\u2019ll see what we means,\u201d said\u000athe witness, in great wrath.
p15932
aV\u201cHold your noise,\u201d said the policeman.
p15933
aV\u201cI daresay it\u2019s all nonsense when\u000awe come to the bottom of it; and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m very sorry to disturb the\u000aladies; but I must just \u2019ave a few words with the young gentleman.
p15934
aVMost\u000alikely he can clear it all up.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDolff!\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, with an amazed cry.
p15935
aV\u201cDolff!\u201d cried Meredith, with a burst of laughter.
p15936
aVHis apparent appreciation of this as an excellent joke confused the two\u000amen.
p15937
aVThey looked at each other again for mutual support.
p15938
aV\u201cYou\u2019d not have laughed if you\u2019d seen him, as I did,\u201d growled the\u000astranger.
p15939
aV\u201cI felt--him, whoever he was, as you didn\u2019t, my man; and it is evident\u000ayou think me a poor creature, to be battered about by a boy--or a woman.
p15940
aVCome, there\u2019s enough of this nonsense,\u201d he said.
p15941
aV\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you seize\u000athe fellow when you saw him?
p15942
aVWhat do you mean, coming with this\u000acock-and-bull story three weeks after--and to me?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cProduce the young gentleman, sir, and let me just ask him a few\u000aquestions.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI haven\u2019t got him in my pocket,\u201d said Meredith.
p15943
aV\u201cProbably he has gone\u000aout.
p15944
aVIf he were here, I should not allow him to answer your questions.
p15945
aVI\u2019m his legal adviser.
p15946
aVCome, come, don\u2019t let us have any more of this.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf he has gone out,\u201d said the policeman, \u201cby this time he\u2019s in the\u000ahands of my mate--and if he haven\u2019t I\u2019ve a right to search the house.
p15947
aVYou\u2019d better produce him, mister--or you, lady, before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet, unable to bear the scene which was thus rising to a climax, had\u000agot up out of the shadow and left the room a moment before.
p15948
aVThe hall was\u000aperfectly vacant, not a trace of any one in it--not even Priscilla going\u000aabout her business, or the nurse in the dining-room, which was still\u000asacred to the invalid.
p15949
aVThe lamp burned steadily, the silence was\u000adreadful to the excited girl.
p15950
aVIt seemed like the pause of fate--not a\u000asound within or without--even the voices, subdued by distance, but\u000agenerally audible in a cheerful hum from the kitchen, were hushed\u000ato-night.
p15951
aVAll perfectly silent--calm as if tumult or tragedy had never\u000aentered there.
p15952
aVCHAPTER XL.
p15953
aV\u201cI must go after them; I must--I must follow them!
p15954
aVOh, Dolff, where are\u000ayou--where are you?\u201d cried Mrs. Harwood.
p15955
aVShe was wild with excitement and alarm, her face alternately flushed and\u000apaled, her form trembling with endeavor to move, to push herself\u000aforward, to follow those dreadful emissaries of the law whose heavy\u000asteps were very audible, now on the stairs, now overhead.
p15956
aVThe other members of the party were in strange contrast to her anxiety.
p15957
aVMeredith lay back in his chair rubbing his hands moved apparently by the\u000asupremest sense of the ludicrous, unable to see it in any but a\u000aridiculous light.
p15958
aVGussy leaned on the back of his chair, smiling in\u000asympathy with him, yet a little pale and wondering, beginning to realize\u000athat something disagreeable, painful, might be going on, though it did\u000anot mean fatigue or excitement to her patient.
p15959
aVJulia, finally roused\u000afrom her book, had got up bewildered, and stood asking what was the\u000amatter, getting no reply from anyone.
p15960
aVThe door of the drawing-room had been left open, and across the hall, at\u000athe opposite door of what was now Meredith\u2019s room, stood the nurse in\u000aher white cap and apron, with a wondering face, looking out.
p15961
aV\u201cI thought I knew a great deal about the folly of the authorities,\u201d said\u000aMeredith, \u201cand of Scotland Yard in particular, but this is the climax.
p15962
aVBy-the-bye, I see an opportunity for a great sensation, which, if I were\u000aat the Old Bailey, would make my fortune.
p15963
aV\u2018The prisoner, accused of a\u000amurderous assault upon Mr. Meredith, was defended by that gentleman in\u000aperson.\u2019 What a situation for the press--one might add, \u2018who is a family\u000aconnection,\u2019 eh, Gussy?\u201d he said, putting up his hand to take hers,\u000awhich was upon the back of his chair.
p15964
aV\u201cOh, Charley!
p15965
aVbut speak to mamma.
p15966
aVMamma is miserable.
p15967
aVEverything about\u000aDolff makes her so anxious.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cEven such an excellent joke?\u201d said Meredith: but he did not say\u000aanything to comfort Mrs. Harwood.
p15968
aVIn the midst of his laugh a sudden gravity came over him.
p15969
aVHe looked at\u000aher again with a quick, scrutinizing glance.
p15970
aVDolff was not all.
p15971
aVShe had\u000abeen bewildered--taken by surprise, but was not really anxious about her\u000ason.
p15972
aVNow, however, as she sat listening, waiting, her suspense became\u000aunbearable.
p15973
aVA woman imprisoned in her chair never moving, unable to walk\u000aa step, she looked as if at any moment she might dart out of it and\u000afling herself after the invaders.
p15974
aVHer hands moved uneasily upon the arms\u000aof her chair, plucking at them as if to raise herself.
p15975
aVThe light in her\u000aeyes was a wild glare of desperation.
p15976
aVThe color fluttered on her face,\u000anow ebbing away and leaving her ghastly, now coming back with a sudden\u000aflush.
p15977
aVHe remembered suddenly all that might be involved in a search of\u000athat house, and that for anything he knew a secret which it was of the\u000autmost importance he should fathom now lay, as it were, within reach of\u000ahis hand.
p15978
aVHe became serious all at once, the laugh passing suddenly from\u000ahis face.
p15979
aVHe got up but not to stop the examination, as Gussy hoped.
p15980
aVHe\u000adid not even stop to soothe Mrs. Harwood, but strolled out into the hall\u000aon his unsteady limbs, forgetting them all.
p15981
aV\u201cI must go after them,\u201d Mrs. Harwood cried again, half raising herself\u000ain her chair.
p15982
aV\u201cI must go after them.
p15983
aVGussy, they may go--how can we tell\u000awhere they may go?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, mamma, there is nothing to be alarmed about.
p15984
aVVicars will see to\u000athat.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow can we tell where Vicars is?
p15985
aVI have been afraid of something of the\u000akind all my life.
p15986
aVGussy, I must go myself.
p15987
aVI must go myself!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, hush, mamma,\u201d said Gussy; she was not alarmed about a risk which\u000ahad never frightened her at all.
p15988
aVMrs. Harwood was always nervous; but\u000aGussy, who had been used to it for years, had never believed that\u000aanything would happen.
p15989
aVSo long as Charley did not throw himself\u000aback--was not over-excited.
p15990
aVThis was what Gussy most feared.
p15991
aV\u201cI\u2019ll take you wherever you like, mamma,\u201d said Julia, coming with a rush\u000ato the back of the chair, and projecting her mother into the hall with a\u000aforce which nearly shook her out of it.
p15992
aVMrs. Harwood\u2019s precipitate\u000aprogress was arrested by Meredith, who called out to Julia to go softly,\u000aand caught at the arm of the chair as it swung past.
p15993
aV\u201cAre you coming too, to keep an eye on them?\u201d he said.
p15994
aV\u201cI don\u2019t like,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, trying to subdue the trembling of her\u000alips, \u201cto have such people all over my house.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, they are honest enough; there will be no picking or stealing.
p15995
aVAs\u000afor the thing itself, it\u2019s a farce.
p15996
aVI daresay Dolff has gone out.
p15997
aVAnd,\u000aif not, what does it matter?
p15998
aVIf there is any such ridiculous idea about,\u000ayou had better meet it and be done with it.
p15999
aVIt\u2019s a wonder they don\u2019t\u000aarrest me for knocking down myself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood faintly, \u201cI am not afraid for Dolff.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can have nothing else to be afraid of,\u201d said Meredith, in his\u000acareless tones.
p16000
aV\u201cA search by the police is nothing unless there happens\u000ato be something for them to find out.
p16001
aVNothing is of any importance\u000aunless it is true.
p16002
aVThey may search till they are tired, but, so long as\u000athere is nobody in hiding, what can it matter?
p16003
aVDon\u2019t trouble yourself\u000aabout nothing.
p16004
aVLet me take you back to your comfortable fireside.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, no,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, more and more troubled; \u201cI will stay here.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe had not, it was evident, found the way to save her, with all his\u000aphilosophy.
p16005
aV\u201cNo?\u201d said Meredith, interrogatively.
p16006
aV\u201cIt\u2019s rather cold here, however,\u000aafter the cosiness of the drawing-room.
p16007
aVI hope you\u2019ll not catch cold.
p16008
aVIf\u000ait is any satisfaction to you, of course, there\u2019s nothing to be said:\u000abut I should think you might let me look out for these fellows and send\u000athem off.
p16009
aVJulia and me,\u201d he added, with a wave of his hand to Julia,\u000aand the smile which was so exasperating.
p16010
aVHe kept wondering all the time where Janet was--Janet, who had\u000adisappeared without attracting any notice, and who probably, he thought,\u000ahad helped to smuggle Dolff away somewhere, uselessly--because when such\u000aan accusation was once made, it was much better to brave it out.
p16011
aVIt was\u000alike the folly of a woman to try to smuggle him away, when the only\u000athing was to brave it out.
p16012
aV\u201cThis is the only place where there is no draught,\u201d he said, pushing\u000aMrs. Harwood\u2019s chair directly in front of the door which led to the\u000awing--the door, which, on the night of the ball, he and Janet had\u000amiraculously found unfastened.
p16013
aVThe door, he remarked once more, had every appearance of being a door\u000abuilt up and impracticable.
p16014
aVTo say, in a carefully-kept house like this,\u000athat it was covered with dust would not have been true, but there was an\u000aair about it as if it had been covered with dust.
p16015
aVMeredith smiled at\u000ahimself while he made this reflection.
p16016
aVHis heart was singularly buoyant\u000aand free, full of excitement, yet of pleasurable excitement.
p16017
aVHe was on\u000athe eve of finding out something he wanted to find out, and he was most\u000aparticularly concerned that the circumstances which favored him should\u000aoverwhelm Mrs. Harwood.
p16018
aVHe placed her almost exactly in front of the\u000adoor as if she had intended to veil it, and drew over one of the hall\u000achairs beside her and threw himself down upon it.
p16019
aV\u201cThis is the most sheltered spot,\u201d he said, \u201cout of reach of the door\u000aand several other draughts.
p16020
aVIf you will stay out in the hall and catch\u000acold, Mrs. Harwood, you are safest here.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe glanced at the door as he drew her up to it with a repressed\u000ashudder.
p16021
aVShe had become deadly pale, and in the faint light looked as if\u000ashe had suddenly become a hundred years old, withered and shrunken up\u000awith age.
p16022
aVJulia, very much startled, and with eyes wide open and\u000aastonished, stood by her mother.
p16023
aV\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have put her by that nasty shut-up door; there is always a\u000awind from under it,\u201d she said.
p16024
aV\u201cHush--oh, hush!\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, with a shiver.
p16025
aVThe detective and his companion were coming downstairs, led by the\u000asniffing and contemptuous Priscilla.
p16026
aVThey came down cautiously with\u000atheir heavy boots, as if they might have slipped on the soft carpets.
p16027
aV\u201cWell,\u201d said Meredith, as they came in sight, \u201cfound anything?
p16028
aVWe are\u000awaiting here to hear your news.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, sir; the young gentleman have got clean away, so far as I can\u000asee,\u201d said the policeman; \u201cbut you know, sir, as well as me, for a man\u000athat\u2019s known to struggle with the p\u2019leece is no good.
p16029
aVHe\u2019ll be got at,\u000asooner or later, and it\u2019s far better to give himself up at once.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is exactly my opinion,\u201d said Meredith, \u201cand I should have given\u000ahim that advice if either of us had known what you meant; but, you see,\u000aa young gentleman who has nothing on his conscience does not think what\u000ais the wisest thing to do about the police--for he does not expect to\u000ahave anything to do with them.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope he have as easy a conscience as that,\u201d said the detective.
p16030
aV\u201cI hope he has, and I don\u2019t doubt it, either.
p16031
aVWell--what are you going\u000ato do now?
p16032
aVYou\u2019ve looked through all this part of the house, I suppose?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe began with the upper rooms first.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat was scarcely wise of you,\u201d said Meredith, \u201che might have popped\u000aout of one of those rooms and run for it, while you were busy upstairs.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cScarcely that, sir,\u201d said the policeman, with a grin--and he opened the\u000adoor, revealing suddenly a colleague erect and burly in his blue uniform\u000aupon the step outside.
p16033
aVThis sight made even Meredith silent for a moment.
p16034
aVIt made the peril and\u000athe watch real, and brought before him all the difficulties to be\u000aencountered if Dolff (which seemed incredible) should actually be taken,\u000acommitted to prison, and tried for a murderous attack upon his own life.
p16035
aVIt was so appalling, and he knew so little how to meet it if it really\u000abecame an actual situation to be reckoned with, that for a moment he was\u000astunned; then he thought it best to burst into a laugh.
p16036
aVThe effect on\u000aMrs. Harwood was naturally still more serious.
p16037
aVThe poor lady began to\u000acry:\u000a\u000a\u201cIs it my boy, my Dolff, that they are hunting down like that?
p16038
aVOh!
p16039
aVCharley, you are the only one that can tell them how--how ridiculous it\u000ais--tell them it\u2019s not true.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m very sorry, ma\u2019am, to disturb you,\u201d said the policeman, \u201cbut will\u000ayou just move your chair from that door?
p16040
aVI beg your pardon, I didn\u2019t\u000aknow the lady couldn\u2019t move--let me do it--thank you, miss--away from\u000athat door.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s not a door,\u201d said Julia, promptly, \u201cit\u2019s been shut up since ever\u000aI remember; that other is the dining-room where Charley Meredith lives,\u000aand that is the library that is standing open.
p16041
aVAnd this is the passage\u000athat leads to the kitchen and the pantry.
p16042
aVAnd there\u2019s the drawing-room\u000aon the other side, And this is a cupboard, and this----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBeg your pardon, miss, we\u2019ll find them all out as we comes to them,\u201d\u000athe man said.
p16043
aV\u201cIt\u2019s hard work, and it\u2019s harder still when we haves to do\u000ait in the face of a lot of ladies as is innocent of everything, and\u000adon\u2019t even know what we means when we speak.
p16044
aVWon\u2019t you say to the lady,\u000asir, as she\u2019ll be far better in her own room, and to let us do what is\u000aour painful dooty?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is unnecessary for you to say anything, Charley,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood;\u000a\u201cif my house is to be treated like a thieves\u2019 den, at least I shall stay\u000ahere.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf it upsets you, lady, don\u2019t blame us,\u201d said the policeman,\u000arespectfully enough.
p16045
aVThey went through all the rooms while she sat watching, Meredith\u000alounging beside her in a chair, occasionally getting up to take a turn\u000aabout the hall.
p16046
aVIf the policeman had been a man of any penetration, he\u000awould have seen that his investigations in these rooms were of no\u000ainterest to the watchers, but that their excitement grew fierce every\u000atime he emerged into the hall.
p16047
aVMeredith felt the fire in his veins burn stronger as they came back and\u000aforward.
p16048
aVIt was with difficulty he could restrain his agitation.
p16049
aVMrs.\u000aHarwood\u2019s chair had been pushed aside, leaving the access open to that\u000amysterious door.
p16050
aVShe sat with her head turned away a little, her hands\u000aclasped together, an image of suspense and painful anxiety, listening\u000afor the men\u2019s steps as they drew nearer.
p16051
aVGussy had followed the rest of\u000athe party, though it was against all her principles to yield to this\u000aexcitement and make a show, as she said, of her feelings.
p16052
aVShe was vexed\u000aespecially to see her mother \u201cgive way.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLet me put you back into the drawing-room, mamma.
p16053
aVWhat is the use of\u000astaying here?
p16054
aVDolff has gone out, evidently.
p16055
aVIt is very silly of him,\u000abut still he has done so.
p16056
aVIt will do him no good for you to catch cold\u000ahere.
p16057
aVCharley, do tell her to come in.
p16058
aVAs for you, you will throw\u000ayourself back a week at least.
p16059
aVOh, for goodness\u2019 sake, do not make\u000aeverything worse by staying here!\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Harwood made no reply.
p16060
aVShe shook her head with speechless\u000aimpatience, and turned her face away.
p16061
aVShe was beyond all considerations\u000abut one, and she could not bear any interruptions, a voice, a sound,\u000awhich kept her strained ears from the knowledge of the men\u2019s movements,\u000aand where they were.
p16062
aVGussy\u2019s whisper continued to Meredith was torture\u000ato her.
p16063
aVShe raised her hand with an imperative gesture to have silence,\u000asilence!
p16064
aVher heart beating in her ears like a sledgehammer rising and\u000afalling was surely enough, without having any whispering and foolish,\u000avain, ineffectual words.
p16065
aV\u201cThere\u2019s nothing now but this door,\u201d said the policeman, coming out\u000asomewhat crestfallen.
p16066
aV\u201cHe\u2019s nowhere else, that\u2019s clear.
p16067
aVIf he ain\u2019t here\u000ahe\u2019s given us the slip--for the moment.
p16068
aVHallo!
p16069
aVit\u2019s locked, this one is!
p16070
aVI\u2019ll thank you, sir, to get me the key.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have always understood,\u201d said Meredith, blandly, \u201cthat the door was\u000abuilt up, or fastened up.
p16071
aVIt has never been used since I have known the\u000ahouse.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI told you so,\u201d said Julia, \u201cif you had listened to me.
p16072
aVIt isn\u2019t a door\u000aat all, and leads to nowhere.
p16073
aVIt was once the door of the wing,\u201d she\u000acontinued, with the liking of a child for giving information, \u201cbut it\u000ahas never once been opened since ever I was born.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe wing!
p16074
aVthat\u2019s them empty rooms as we see from the garden--the very\u000aplace for a man to hide.
p16075
aVTell you what, sir, I can\u2019t bear to upset the\u000alady--but we must break in if we can\u2019t get in quietly.
p16076
aVYou might try if\u000ayou couldn\u2019t get us the key, and take the ladies away--anyhow, get the\u000aold lady to go away--whatever happens, she\u2019d better not be here.\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Harwood spoke quickly, in a hoarse and broken voice.
p16077
aV\u201cThere is no key,\u201d she said.
p16078
aV\u201cI give you five minutes to think of it, lady,\u201d said the man; \u201cotherwise\u000awe must break in the door.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere was a dreadful silence--a silence which no one dared to break.
p16079
aV\u201cI am telling you the truth; you cannot open it, it has always been shut\u000aup.
p16080
aVThere is no key.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER XLI.
p16081
aVThe policeman\u2019s epigrammatic assertion that it was difficult for a known\u000aman to struggle with the police, is still more true when it is only a\u000adoor which stands before a couple of men excited and exasperated by\u000afailure and a probable discovery.
p16082
aVThe door was a strong door, it was\u000apartially plated with iron, and its lock was cunningly devised, but\u000aafter a while it began to give way.
p16083
aVMeredith, altogether absorbed in this new turn of affairs, and carried\u000aaway by the prospect which it opened to him as well as to its\u000aassailants, seemed to the bystanders to have altogether gone over to the\u000aenemy.
p16084
aVHe stood by them, encouraging them in a low tone, suggesting how\u000ato strike, examining into the weak points with the keenest critical eye;\u000ain fact, in the excitement of the moment, forgetting all his precautions\u000aand pretence of indifference, and throwing himself on the side of the\u000aassailants.
p16085
aVHe had, it is true, the safe ground to fall back upon that,\u000aas he had always been assured there was nothing there, he could do no\u000apossible harm in helping to prove that fact to the men who would not be\u000aconvinced in any other way.
p16086
aVMrs. Harwood sat with her face to the door, her arms crossed upon her\u000abreast, her whole frame swaying and moving with the strokes that rained\u000aupon it.
p16087
aVWhen a crash came she shivered and shrank into herself as if\u000athe blow had struck her--a low moan came involuntarily to her lips.
p16088
aVGussy, who had abandoned Meredith after trying in vain to restrain him,\u000acame and stood by her mother\u2019s chair, with a hand upon her shoulder.
p16089
aV\u201cOh, mamma, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d said Gussy, in her ear, \u201cdon\u2019t!
p16090
aVDon\u2019t let\u000athem see you mind it so.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe mother half turned to her a face which was livid in its terror.
p16091
aVHer\u000aeyes, so clear usually, had lost their color even, and seemed to float\u000ain a sort of liquefication, the iris disappearing into the watery black\u000aglobe--her mouth was open.
p16092
aVShe uttered a murmur of inarticulate passion,\u000aand made as though she would have struck the soothing hand.
p16093
aVBut the men\u000aat this exciting work took no notice of Mrs. Harwood.
p16094
aVThe officer of the\u000alaw was more fit to break down a resisting door than to draw subtle\u000adeductions from the looks of the besieged family.
p16095
aVThe practical matter\u000awas within his sphere.
p16096
aVHe only looked round with an exclamation of\u000atriumph when the door at last burst from its holdings, and the dark\u000apassage gaped open before them with its curtains drawn back.
p16097
aV\u201cThere!\u201d he shouted, turning round for a moment, \u201cthere\u2019s your door that\u000anever was used,\u201d and would have dashed in had not his attendant held him\u000aback.
p16098
aV\u201cI say,\u201d said the man who had hitherto followed him like a shadow, \u201chow\u000ado ye know that he hasn\u2019t got a revolver up there?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe detective fell back for a moment.
p16099
aV\u201cWe\u2019ve got to risk it,\u201d he said, with the professional stoicism of a man\u000abound to meet danger at any time.
p16100
aVHe was not of much use in scenting out\u000aa mystery, but he could face a possible revolver with the stolid courage\u000aof his class.
p16101
aVHe made a pause, however, and added, with a rare effort of\u000areflection, \u201cAnd this one\u2019s new to it; he\u2019s not up to their dodges----\u201d\u000a_They_ were the criminal class with which a straightforward policeman is\u000aaccustomed to deal.
p16102
aVMeredith followed with an excitement which made him forget everything,\u000aeven the group of women bewildered in the hall.
p16103
aVHe knew his way, though\u000ahe dared not show that he did.
p16104
aVHe followed the burly figure, and the\u000asmaller ill-trained one of the attendant informer and witness, as they\u000awound themselves up in the curtains and came to a pause opposite every\u000aobstacle.
p16105
aVThe passage was perfectly dark, but the inner doors were not\u000aclosed, notwithstanding the sounds of assault which those within must\u000ahave heard.
p16106
aVIt turned out that the only individual within who had his\u000awits about him had been too closely occupied to be able to look to those\u000ameans of defence.
p16107
aVFor a moment the group of the ladies below hung together in bewildered\u000ahorror.
p16108
aVThen Julia launched herself after the men into the dark passage,\u000adrawn by inextinguishable curiosity and the excitement of a child in\u000asight of the unknown.
p16109
aVMrs. Harwood had covered her face with her hands,\u000aand lay back in her chair, fallen upon herself like a fallen house,\u000alying, so to speak, in ruins.
p16110
aVGussy, with her arm round her mother\u2019s\u000ashoulders, whispered, with tears and a little gasping, frightened\u000acrying, some words that were intended to be consolatory in her\u000ainattentive ears.
p16111
aV\u201cIt is nothing wrong,\u201d Gussy said; \u201cit is nothing wrong.
p16112
aVIt was to save\u000ahim.
p16113
aVIt is nothing wrong.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut by-and-bye the strong attraction of that open way along which the\u000aunseen party were stumbling seized upon her also.
p16114
aVAnd her patient, who\u000ahad to be taken care of--who was throwing himself back!
p16115
aVGussy cast a\u000apiteous glance upon her mother, lying there with her face upon her\u000ahands, paying no attention, whatever comfort might be poured into her\u000aear, and presently impatience got the better of her sympathy, and she\u000atoo followed in the train.
p16116
aVShe knew the secret of the wing.
p16117
aVShe was the\u000aonly other in the house, except Mrs. Harwood, to whom that secret was\u000aknown.
p16118
aVBut in how innocent and simple a way!
p16119
aVShe was troubled, but she\u000ahad no sense of guilt; and Gussy said to herself that it was her duty to\u000ago and explain, to make it known to the others how simple it all was,\u000awhen the fascination became too much for her to resist, and, with one\u000aglance at her mother, she too stole away.
p16120
aVAs for Dolff, he had\u000adisappeared from their minds, and the incredible suspicion attached to\u000ahim, as if he had never been born.
p16121
aVFrom the moment that the search began\u000ait had been to Mrs. Harwood a search for her secret, and nothing more.
p16122
aVJanet had been all this time hanging about unseen.
p16123
aVShe could not rest,\u000ashe who knew so much more than any one else in the house--both the\u000amystery of the wing and the miserable story of Dolff and his guilt,\u000aboth of them--as nobody else did: neither Mrs. Harwood, whose thoughts\u000awere concentrated upon one, nor Meredith, who had discovered or divined\u000athe other, but did not know as Janet did, who knew everything, what had\u000abeen the cause of Dolff\u2019s terrible folly, and what its results, and even\u000awhen and how he had disappeared.
p16124
aVShe had been hanging about now in one\u000aroom, now in another, terrified to show herself, incapable of concealing\u000aherself, her very terror of being mixed up in it yielding to the\u000afellow-felling of a general misery in which she had but her share, and\u000athat not so great a share as the others.
p16125
aVWhen she saw that the mother of the house, who was the most to be pitied\u000aof all in this dreadful emergency, was left there forlorn and alone,\u000alying helpless, unable to go after the others, to confront the\u000acatastrophe, at least, as her children could, Janet\u2019s heart was touched.
p16126
aVShe stole down the stairs where she had been watching, looking down upon\u000athem all, and came to Mrs. Harwood\u2019s side.
p16127
aVIt was not for her to console\u000aor comfort.
p16128
aVJanet was aware that she had been more or less the cause of\u000aall the trouble.
p16129
aVShe had found out the family secret, without in the\u000aleast understanding it, and this was no blame of hers; but she had\u000abetrayed it to one who did understand it, and who might, for all she\u000aknew, use his knowledge unmercifully, being, as she knew him to be, a\u000aman with very little truth or inclination to spare another.
p16130
aVAnd she had\u000abeen, without any doubt, the cause of Dolff\u2019s misfortune in every way.
p16131
aVShe had taken him into her toils innocently enough, with no more\u000aguiltiness than that of any other girl who had let a foolish young man\u000afall in love with her, and then had driven him mad by her falsehood, and\u000aled him into crime--almost to the crime of murder.
p16132
aVAll this was in\u000aJanet\u2019s mind as she stole down the stairs to his mother\u2019s side.
p16133
aVShe had\u000aplenty of excuse for herself had any one accused her, but in her heart\u000ashe was impartial, and knew very well how much she was to blame.
p16134
aVHer\u000aheart beat loudly in consonance with the sounds of that exploring party\u000ain the dark passage, going to find out--how much more than they sought!
p16135
aVShe understood it all better than anyone.
p16136
aVMeredith\u2019s keen satisfaction\u000ain unveiling the mystery, and the stupid astonishment of the strangers,\u000awho had no suspicion, and Gussy----but what Gussy would feel was the\u000aone thing that Janet did not divine, for she was unaware how much or how\u000alittle Gussy knew.
p16137
aVShe stood by the chair in which Mrs. Harwood lay, all sunken upon\u000aherself like a fallen tower, her face hidden, her shoulders drawn\u000atogether, sinking to her knees.
p16138
aVJanet dared not say anything.
p16139
aVShe put\u000aher hand upon the arm of the chair, not even upon the unhappy lady\u2019s\u000aarm, which she felt that she dared not touch--and stood by her.
p16140
aVIt was\u000aall that any one could do.
p16141
aVThe two were left there like wrecks on the\u000ashore, from, which everything had ebbed away, even the tumult and the\u000astorm which had been raging round.
p16142
aVThe sounds went on getting fainter,\u000athe voices dropped, the footsteps seemed to mount and then grow still,\u000astumbling at first a little, gradually dying out.
p16143
aVMrs. Harwood did not\u000amove, nor did Janet, standing by her, scarcely breathing.
p16144
aVWere they both\u000afollowing, in imagination, the darkling way which both knew, or had the\u000amother, at last, fallen into a blind insensibility, hearing and knowing\u000ano more?
p16145
aVThis imagination was, however, suddenly put an end to by a moaning from\u000athe chair.
p16146
aV\u201cI can\u2019t bear this any longer; I can\u2019t bear this!\u201d said Mrs, Harwood.
p16147
aV\u201cOh, my God!
p16148
aVmy God!
p16149
aVHave they got _there_?\u201d Then she cried, loudly, \u201cI\u000acan\u2019t bear it!
p16150
aVI can\u2019t bear it!\u201d and with a sudden wrench, as if she\u000awere tearing herself like a limb from its socket, the disabled woman\u000arose.
p16151
aVJanet, terrified, gave a cry of dismay as, stumbling and tottering, she\u000aflung herself out of the chair.
p16152
aVWhether Mrs. Harwood had been aware of\u000aher presence before this she could not tell; but, at all events, now she\u000awas beyond all sentiment of displeasure or reproof.
p16153
aVShe put out her\u000ashaking hand and grasped at Janet\u2019s arm as if it had been a post.
p16154
aVThe\u000agirl\u2019s slight figure swayed and almost gave way at the sudden weight\u000aflung upon it; but the burden steadied her after the first moment\u2019s\u000auncertainty.
p16155
aVMrs. Harwood\u2019s face had collapsed with the extreme anguish\u000aof the crisis past; her features seemed blurred, like the half-liquid,\u000avaguely floating eyes, which did not seem to see anything.
p16156
aVShe made a\u000aheavy, uncertain step forward, carrying her prop with her by mere\u000amomentum of weight and weakness.
p16157
aV\u201cCome,\u201d she said, hoarsely, \u201ccome!\u201d\u000a\u000a       *       *       *       *       *\u000a\u000aJanet never knew how these dark passages were got through.
p16158
aVShe was\u000aherself enfolded, carried away in the burden of the helpless woman who\u000aleaned upon her guidance for every step.
p16159
aVTheir progress was wildly\u000adevious and uneven, every step being a sort of falling forward, which\u000anevertheless carried them on with spasmodic rapidity, though terrible\u000aeffort.
p16160
aVThe voices and steps in front of them grew audible again, but\u000abefore they reached the last door, which stood open with curtains drawn\u000aaside, disclosing a warm blaze of light, there arose a sudden tumult, a\u000aroar as of some wild creature, with answering cries of panic and dismay.
p16161
aVThe opened doorway suddenly darkened with a crowd of retreating figures,\u000aand Julia darted out from the midst and came blindly flying upon the\u000atottering group that was struggling forward.
p16162
aV\u201cGo back, go back!\u201d cried Julia, \u201cwhoever you are.
p16163
aVThere\u2019s a madman\u000athere!\u201d and then she gave a shriek as wild as the sounds that came from\u000athe room, \u201cOh,\u201d cried the girl, her shrill voice dominating even that\u000ariot, \u201cit\u2019s mamma!
p16164
aVMy mother\u2019s here!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER XLII.
p16165
aVNext moment they had surged as on the top of a wave to the room within.
p16166
aVNothing could be more strange than the scene presented there.
p16167
aVThe room\u000awas curtained all round with red, hung above a man\u2019s height with ruddy\u000athick folds, upon which the firelight threw a still warmer flicker.
p16168
aVA\u000ashaded lamp filled it with softened light, and from above, from what\u000aseemed a large skylight, a white stream of moonlight fell in, making a\u000acurious disturbing effect in the warm artificial light.
p16169
aVThese\u000aaccessories, however, though they told afterwards, were as nothing to\u000athe sight that burst upon the eyes of the new-comers.
p16170
aVIn the centre of\u000athe room stood a tall old man, with a long pallid face, straggling white\u000ahair, and a white beard.
p16171
aVHis face was distorted with excitement, his\u000avoice bellowing forth a succession of cries, or rather roars, like the\u000aroars of a wild animal.
p16172
aVHis loose lips gave forth these utterances with\u000aflying foam and a sort of mechanical rapidity:\u000a\u000a\u201cI know what you\u2019ve come for?
p16173
aVI can pay up!
p16174
aVI can pay up!
p16175
aVI\u2019ve plenty of\u000amoney, and I can pay up!
p16176
aVBut I won\u2019t be taken, not if it costs me my\u000alife!\u201d\u000a\u000aThese were the words that finally emancipated themselves from the\u000astammering utterance and became clear.
p16177
aVVicars stood behind this wild figure holding both his arms, but it was\u000aonly by glimpses that the smaller man was visible holding the other as\u000ain a vise.
p16178
aV\u201cCome, sir, come, sir, no more of this; they\u2019ll take you for a fool,\u201d he\u000asaid.
p16179
aVAnd then this King Lear resumed.
p16180
aVThe foam flew from his lips; his great\u000avoice came out in its wild bellowing, the very voice which Janet had\u000aheard so often.
p16181
aVIt had seemed to her to utter but an inarticulate cry,\u000abut this, it would seem, was what it had been saying all the time--words\u000ain which there was some meaning--though what that meaning was, or\u000awhether the speaker himself understood it, who would say?
p16182
aVThe policeman and his attendant had edged towards the doorway, and stood\u000athere huddled upon one another.
p16183
aVThe leader of the search had been\u000awilling to face a revolver, but the madman was a thing for which he was\u000anot prepared.
p16184
aVHe stood against the doorway ready to retreat still\u000afurther in case there should be any further advance.
p16185
aVMeredith and Gussy\u000ahad passed into the room, and stood together, she very anxious, he very\u000aeager, at the side, where those wild eyes had not caught them.
p16186
aVBehind\u000awas Dolff very pale, standing half concealed by the group formed by the\u000amadman and his attendant, raising his head to look over them to the two\u000ain the doorway who had come to look for him, and had received so\u000aunexpected a check.
p16187
aVMrs. Harwood stumbled into the midst of this strange scene with her\u000atottering uncertain stride, driving Janet with her.
p16188
aVShe put up her hand\u000ato hold back the dreadful insane figure.
p16189
aVShe was at one of the moments\u000ain life when one is afraid of nothing, shrinks from nothing.
p16190
aV\u201cTake him back to his seat, Vicars,\u201d she said, \u201ctake him back.
p16191
aVAdolphus!\u201d The tottering, helpless woman stood up straight, and put her\u000ahand upon the madman\u2019s breast.
p16192
aVThe eyes that had been blind with misery\u000achanged and dissolved as if to dew in their orbits, consolidated again,\u000aopened blue and strong like a relighted flame.
p16193
aVShe fixed them upon the\u000astaring red eyes of the maniac.
p16194
aV\u201cAdolphus, go back, be silent, calm\u000ayourself.
p16195
aVThere is no need for you to say anything.
p16196
aVI am here to take\u000acare of you.
p16197
aVLet Vicars put you back in your chair.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI will not be taken,\u201d he said, \u201cI will not be taken!
p16198
aVI can pay up.
p16199
aVI\u000ahave got money, plenty of money.
p16200
aVI will pay up!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cVicars,\u201d cried Mrs. Harwood, imperiously, \u201cput him back in his chair.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe held her hand on his breast, and fixed her eyes upon his, pushing\u000ahim softly back.
p16201
aVThe roarings grew fainter, fell into a kind of\u000awhimpering cry.
p16202
aV\u201cI\u2019ll pay it all--I have plenty of money.
p16203
aVDon\u2019t let them take me\u000aaway--I\u2019ll pay everything up!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGo back and rest in your chair, Adolphus.
p16204
aVPut him in his chair.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe astonished spectators all stood looking on while the old servant and\u000athis woman, whom force of necessity had moved from her own helplessness,\u000asubdued the maniac.
p16205
aVVicars had partially lost his head, he had lost\u000acontrol of his patient, but this unlooked-for help restored him to\u000ahimself.
p16206
aVBetween them they drew and guided the patient back to the\u000achair, which was fitted with some mechanical appliances, and held him\u000afast.
p16207
aVMrs. Harwood seemed to forget her weakness entirely; she tottered\u000ano longer, but moved with a free step.
p16208
aVShe turned round upon the\u000afrightened policeman at the door.
p16209
aV\u201cNow go,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have done your worst; whatever you want, go;\u000ayou can get no further satisfaction here.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe intruder breathed more freely when he saw the madman sink into\u000aquietude.
p16210
aVHe said, with a voice that quivered slightly.
p16211
aV\u201cI am very willing to go: but that young gentleman has to go along with\u000ame!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCome on,\u201d cried the other man, whose teeth were chattering in his head.
p16212
aV\u201cCome on; we\u2019ve got nothing to do here.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m going: when that young gentleman makes up his mind to come with\u000ame.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat young gentleman?
p16213
aVWhy, bless you, _that_ ain\u2019t the young\u000agentleman!\u201d said the man, who had struggled out into the passage, and\u000awas now only kept from running by the other\u2019s strong retaining grasp.
p16214
aVIt was not wonderful that the policeman was indignant.
p16215
aVHe let his friend\u000ago with an oath, and with a sudden push which precipitated him into the\u000aouter room.
p16216
aV\u201cYou d----d fool!
p16217
aVto have led me such a dance; and as much as our lives\u000aare worth, and come to nothing at the end.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe man fell backward, but got up again in a moment and took to his\u000aheels, with the noise as of a runaway horse in the dark passage.
p16218
aVThe\u000apoliceman, reassured to see that the madman was secured, had the courage\u000ato linger a moment.
p16219
aVHe turned to Meredith with a defiant look.
p16220
aV\u201cIt has come to nothing, sir, and I ask your pardon that I\u2019ve been led\u000ainto giving you this trouble by an ass.
p16221
aVBut I make bold to ask is this\u000ahouse licensed?
p16222
aVand what right has anyone got to keep a dangerous madman\u000ain it without inspection, or any eye over \u2019im?
p16223
aVI\u2019ll have to report it to\u000amy superior.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cReport it to the--devil, and be off with you,\u201d Meredith said.
p16224
aVThe party stood round, staring into each other\u2019s faces, when the\u000astrangers thus withdrew.
p16225
aVThe madman struggled against the fastenings\u000athat secured him.
p16226
aV\u201cJulia,\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t let them take me!\u201d He tried to get hold of her\u000awith his hands, feeling for her as if he did not see, and began to cry\u000afeebly, in a childish, broken voice, \u201cDon\u2019t let them take me!
p16227
aVI have got\u000aenough to pay everybody.
p16228
aVI kept it for you and the children.
p16229
aVIt was for\u000ayou and the children; but I\u2019ll pay up, I\u2019ll pay everybody; only don\u2019t\u000alet them take me, don\u2019t let them take me!\u201d he whimpered, tears--piteous,\u000achildish tears--suffusing the venerable face.
p16230
aV\u201cOh,\u201d cried Gussy, \u201cdon\u2019t let him cry; for God\u2019s sake don\u2019t let him cry!
p16231
aVI cannot bear it--I cannot bear it--it is too much.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ll never complain any more,\u201d said the patient; \u201cI\u2019m very comfortable,\u000aI don\u2019t want for anything.
p16232
aVYou shall pay them all up yourself if you\u000adon\u2019t believe me.
p16233
aVI\u2019ll give you the money--only don\u2019t let them send me\u000aaway!
p16234
aVI\u2019ve got it all safe here,\u201d he said.
p16235
aV\u201cStop a moment, I\u2019ll give it\u000ayou: and all these ladies and gentlemen can prove it, that I gave it you\u000ato pay up.\u201d He struggled to get his arms free, trying to reach his\u000abreast-pocket with one hand.
p16236
aV\u201cVicars, get it out, and give it to your\u000amistress.
p16237
aVThe money--the money, you know, to pay everybody up.
p16238
aVOnly,\u201d he\u000acried, putting the piteous hands together which were held fast and could\u000ado so little, \u201cdon\u2019t, Julia--don\u2019t let them take me away!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, mamma,\u201d cried Gussy, \u201cI can\u2019t bear it--I can\u2019t bear it.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe fell on her knees and covered her face.
p16239
aV\u201cWho is he?\u201d said Dolff.
p16240
aVThey had all of them, and even Dolff himself,\u000aforgotten what was the cause of this revelation.
p16241
aVThe young man came\u000aforward, very pale.
p16242
aV\u201cI know nothing about this,\u201d he said, looking round;\u000a\u201cnothing.
p16243
aVI hope everybody will believe me.
p16244
aVI want to know who he is!\u201d\u000a\u000aNo one said a word, they all stood round, struck silent, not knowing\u000awhat to think.
p16245
aVMrs. Harwood stood with her hand upon the table,\u000asupporting herself, asking no other support.
p16246
aVShe was perfectly pale, but\u000aher countenance had recovered its features and expression.
p16247
aVShe did not\u000aeven look at her children--one on her knees, one standing up confronting\u000aher, demanding to know the truth.
p16248
aVTo neither of them did she give a word\u000aor look.
p16249
aVHer eyes were fixed upon the man who was thus utterly in her\u000ahands.
p16250
aVVicars extracted an old, large pocket-book from the pocket of the\u000apatient, and handed it to her, not without a sort of\u000asmile--half-mocking--on his face.
p16251
aVShe took it, glancing at it with a\u000acertain disdain, as if the trick, often employed but no longer\u000anecessary, had disgusted her, and flung it on the table.
p16252
aV\u201cThere are in this book,\u201d she said, \u201cold scraps of paper of no value.
p16253
aVThis is what I am to pay his debts with.
p16254
aVHe has given it to me twenty\u000atimes before.
p16255
aVI get tired in the end of playing the old game over and\u000aover.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMother who is he?\u201d cried Dolff.
p16256
aV\u201cYou have had him in your house, in\u000asecret, never seeing the light of day, and I, your son, never knew.
p16257
aVWho\u000ais he?\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Harwood made no reply.
p16258
aVIt was a question to which no one there could give any answer, except\u000aperhaps Gussy--on her knees, with her hands covering her face--who did\u000anot look up or give any attention to what was going on.
p16259
aVMeredith alone\u000aseemed to have some clear idea in his mind: his face shone with aroused\u000ainterest and eagerness, like a man on the very trace of knowledge of the\u000autmost importance to him.
p16260
aVA rapid process of thought was going on in his\u000amind, his intelligence was leaping from point to point.
p16261
aV\u201cYou will perhaps be surprised,\u201d he said, \u201cto hear that I have known\u000athis for some time.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou!\u201d Mrs. Harwood half turned to him, a gleam as of fire passing over\u000aher face.
p16262
aV\u201cYou!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, I, who have several interests involved.
p16263
aVI had just received\u000ainformation on the subject when that young fool, thinking heaven knows\u000awhat other folly, knocked me down, taking me unawares, and nearly killed\u000ame.
p16264
aVOh, yes, it is perfectly true it was Dolff who did it.
p16265
aVYou start as\u000aif I were likely to make any fuss on that subject.
p16266
aVIs it true that he\u000ahad the money to pay everybody?--that is what I want to know.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCharley, Charley, do you mean to say that Dolff----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, I mean nothing about Dolff,\u201d he said, impatiently: \u201canswer me, Mrs.\u000aHarwood.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI can\u2019t answer for nothing, Mrs. Harwood,\u201d cried Vicars, \u201cif you keep a\u000alot of folks round him.
p16267
aVHe is working himself up into a fury again.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe madman was twisting in his chair, fighting against the mechanical\u000abonds that secured him.
p16268
aVHe was looking towards the pocket-book which lay\u000aon the table.
p16269
aV\u201cShe has got my money, and she throws it down for anybody to pick up,\u201d\u000ahe cried.
p16270
aV\u201cMy money!
p16271
aVthere\u2019s money there to pay everything!
p16272
aVWhy don\u2019t\u000ayou pay those people and let \u2019em go--pay them, pay them and let them go!
p16273
aVor else give me back my money!\u201d he cried, wildly straining forward, with\u000ahis white hair falling back, his reddened eyes blazing, struggling\u000aagainst his bonds.
p16274
aVMrs. Harwood took up the pocket-book, weighing it,\u000awith a sort of forced laugh, in her hand.
p16275
aV\u201cYou think there may be a fortune here--enough to pay?
p16276
aVAnd he thinks\u000aso.
p16277
aVGive it to him, Vicars.
p16278
aVWe\u2019ve tried to keep it all quiet, but it\u000aseems we have failed.
p16279
aVYou may leave the door open now--you may do as you\u000aplease.
p16280
aVIt can\u2019t matter any longer.
p16281
aVI have thought of the credit of the\u000afamily, and of many things that nobody else thinks of.
p16282
aVAnd of his\u000acomfort--nobody will say I have not thought of his comfort.
p16283
aVLook round\u000ayou: there is everything, everything we could think of.
p16284
aVBut it is all of\u000ano use now.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe old man had caught the pocket-book from Vicars\u2019 hands with a pitiful\u000ademonstration of joy.
p16285
aVHe made a pretence of examining its contents,\u000aeagerly turning them over as if to make sure that nothing was lost,\u000akissing the covers in enthusiasm of delight.
p16286
aVHe made an attempt with his\u000aconfined arms to return it to his pocket, but, failing in that, kept it\u000aembraced in both his hands, from time to time kissing it with\u000aextravagant satisfaction.
p16287
aV\u201cAs long as I have got this they can do nothing to me,\u201d he said.
p16288
aVWhile this pantomime was going on, and while still Mrs. Harwood was\u000aspeaking, a little movement and rustle in the group caught everybody\u2019s\u000aattention as if it had been a new fact: but it was only Janet stealing\u000aaway behind the others who had a right there which she did not possess.
p16289
aVShe had been watching her moment.
p16290
aVShe herself, who had nothing to do\u000awith it, had received her share of discomfiture too.
p16291
aVHer heart was\u000asinking with humiliation and shame.
p16292
aVWhat had she to do with the\u000amysteries of the Harwoods, the things they might have to conceal?
p16293
aVWhat\u000awas she to them but a stranger of no account, never thought of, dragged\u000ainto the midst of their troubles when it pleased them, thrown off again\u000awhen they chose?
p16294
aVNobody would have said that Janet had any share in this\u000acrisis, and yet it was she who had received the sharpest arrow of all;\u000aor so, at least, she thought.
p16295
aVShe slipped behind Julia, who was bigger\u000aand more prominent than she, and stole through the bewildering stairs\u000aand passages.
p16296
aVHow well she seemed to know the way, as if it had been\u000afamiliar to her for years!
p16297
aVAnd it was she who had given the\u000ainformation--she who had been the cause of everything, drawn here and\u000adrawn there into affairs alike alien to her, with which she had nothing\u000ato do.
p16298
aVThey were all moved by her departure; not morally, indeed, but by\u000athe mere stir it caused.
p16299
aVGussy rose from her knees, showing a countenance as pale as death and\u000astill glistening with tears.
p16300
aVShe said,\u000a\u000a\u201cMamma, shall we go away?
p16301
aVWhatever there may be to be said or\u000aexplained, it ought not to be done here.\u201d She went up to the old man in\u000athe chair, who was still embracing his pocket-book, and kissed him on\u000athe forehead.
p16302
aV\u201cIf any wrong has been done to you, I don\u2019t know of it,\u201d\u000ashe said; \u201cI thought it was nothing but good.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo wrong has been done to him--none--none,\u201d cried Mrs. Harwood,\u000asuddenly dropping from her self-command and strength.
p16303
aV\u201cChildren, you may\u000anot believe me, since I\u2019ve kept it secret from you.
p16304
aVThere has been no\u000awrong to him--none--none.
p16305
aVIf there has been wrong, it has not been to\u000ahim.
p16306
aVOh, you may believe me, at least, for I have never told you a lie.
p16307
aVEverything has been done for him.
p16308
aVLook round you--look round you and you\u000awill see.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWho is he?\u201d said Dolff, obstinate and pale, standing behind the chair.
p16309
aV\u201cYou have no thought for me,\u201d said the mother.
p16310
aV\u201cYou see me standing\u000ahere, come here to defend you all, in desperation for you, and you never\u000aask how I am to get back, whether it will kill me---- No, no, Janet has\u000agone, who supported me, who was a stranger, and asked no questions, but\u000aonly helped a poor woman half mad with trouble and distress.
p16311
aVAh!\u201d she\u000asaid, \u201che could go mad and get free--he who was the cause of it all: but\u000aI have had to keep my sanity and my courage and bear it all, and look as\u000aif nothing was the matter, for fifteen years.
p16312
aVFor whom?
p16313
aVWas it for me?
p16314
aVIt would have been better for me to have died and been done with it all.
p16315
aVFor you, children, to give you a happy life, to do away with all\u000adisgrace, to give you every advantage.
p16316
aVYes, I\u2019ll take your arm, Ju: you\u000ahave not been a good child, but you know no better.
p16317
aVGet me to my chair\u000abefore I drop down; get me to my chair----\u201d She paused a moment, and\u000alooked round with a hard laugh.
p16318
aV\u201cFor I am very heavy,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u000awould have to be carried, and who would do it I don\u2019t know.
p16319
aVJu, make\u000ahaste, before my strength is all gone.
p16320
aVGet me to my chair.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER XLIII.
p16321
aVGussy was the last to leave of that strange procession, of whom no one\u000aspoke to the other.
p16322
aVShe closed the door after her, and the curtains, and\u000afollowed the erect figure of Dolff, drawn up as it never had been in his\u000alife before, and walking stiffly, as if carrying a new weight and\u000aoccupying a position unknown.
p16323
aVThey all came into the hall, defiling\u000asolemnly one after the other, to find Mrs. Harwood deposited in her\u000achair and awaiting them, almost as if the whole events of the evening\u000ahad been a dream and she had never left that spot.
p16324
aVIt was with a strange\u000aembarrassment, however, that they looked at each other in the pale,\u000aclear light as they emerged from the doorway, almost like making new\u000aacquaintance, as if they had never seen each other before.
p16325
aVNobody\u000acertainly had seen Dolff in that new manifestation; nor was Gussy, she\u000awhose very existence had been wrapped up in that of Meredith, who had\u000aonly lived to watch him for weeks past, recognizable.
p16326
aVIt was she who\u000acame out the last, but who made herself the first of the group.
p16327
aV\u201cThere may be a great many things to say,\u201d said Gussy; \u201cbut not\u000ato-night.
p16328
aVWe have all had a great many agitations to-night.
p16329
aVMy brother\u000ahas been hunted for his life.
p16330
aVMy mother has done a thing which, so far\u000aas we know, she hasn\u2019t been able to do for years.
p16331
aVMr. Meredith has had a\u000abad illness, for which it appears this unfortunate family is responsible\u000atoo.
p16332
aVI only and my little sister\u201d--she paused here with an effort--\u201cno;\u000aI will not pretend; I have had my share of the shock, too.
p16333
aVWe\u2019d better\u000aall separate for the night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGussy!\u201d cried Mrs. Harwood, with a sharp tone of appeal.
p16334
aV\u201cGussy!\u201d cried Meredith, astonished, trying to take her hand to draw her\u000atowards him.
p16335
aV\u201cGussy!\u201d said Dolff, with a certain indignation.
p16336
aV\u201cIt is of no use,\u201d she said, quickly, \u201cto appeal to me.
p16337
aVI think I am the\u000aone who has been deceived all round.
p16338
aVI thought I knew everything, and\u000aI\u2019ve known nothing.
p16339
aVWhatever may be the meaning of it, I for one am not\u000aable for any more to-night, and none of the rest ought to be able for\u000ait.
p16340
aVI don\u2019t know whether I may have been deceived there, too, about how\u000amuch invalids could bear.
p16341
aVGood-night, mamma.
p16342
aVI advise you to get to\u000abed.\u201d\u000a\u000aGussy waved her hand to the others without a word, and walked upstairs\u000awithout turning her head.
p16343
aVThe sudden failure of a perfect faith in all\u000athe world, such as she had entertained without entering into\u000acomplications for which her mind was not adapted, is no small matter.
p16344
aVIt\u000ais alarming even for others to see.
p16345
aVThey all stood for a moment huddled\u000atogether as if a rock or a tower had fallen before their eyes.
p16346
aVThey\u000acould scarcely see each other for the dust and darkness it made.
p16347
aVAll the\u000aother events of this startling night seemed to fall into the background.
p16348
aVGussy!
p16349
aVwho had been the central prop of the house, who had kept\u000aeverybody together, done everything!
p16350
aVWhen she thus threw up her arms\u000athey were all left in dismay, and fell into an assemblage of atoms, of\u000aunits--no longer a united party ready to meet all comers.
p16351
aVMeredith, perhaps, he who had been the most eager, was the most\u000adiscomfited of all.
p16352
aVHe had claimed Gussy\u2019s interest as his right for\u000ayears.
p16353
aVWhen she thus withdrew, not even asking if he were fatigued,\u000aspeaking almost as if she thought that fatigue a pretence, he was so\u000abewildered that he could do nothing.
p16354
aVAn anxious believer like this is\u000aaccepted perhaps with too much faith and considered too inalienable a\u000apossession; and when she fails the shock is proportionately great.
p16355
aVWithout Gussy to stand by him, to make him believe himself a universal\u000aconqueror, always interesting, always important, Meredith for the moment\u000awas like an idol thrown from his pedestal.
p16356
aVHe was more astonished than\u000awords could say.
p16357
aVHe exclaimed, hurriedly,\u000a\u000a\u201cI think Gussy is right, as she always is.
p16358
aVMrs. Harwood, I will say\u000agood-night.\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Harwood was altogether in a different mind.
p16359
aVThe period of reaction\u000ahad not come with her as yet.
p16360
aVShe had got herself deposited in her chair\u000ain time enough to save her from any breaking down.
p16361
aVAnd her spirit was\u000afull of excitement.
p16362
aV\u201cI am ready,\u201d she said, with a panting hot breath of mental commotion,\u000a\u201cto explain--whatever it is necessary to explain.
p16363
aVTake me back to my\u000aroom, Dolff.
p16364
aVIt is cold here.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGood-night,\u201d said Meredith.
p16365
aV\u201cI will not encroach upon you longer\u000ato-night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs you like,\u201d she said.
p16366
aV\u201cI warn you, however, that to-morrow---- Dolff,\u000atake me back to my fire.\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff was unsubdued, like his mother.
p16367
aVThe reaction from a long period of\u000asuspense, and the sense of safety after a great alarm, no doubt acted\u000aupon his mind: though, so far as he was aware, he was moved by nothing\u000asave the overwhelming discovery he had made, and his indignant sense of\u000awrong in finding such a secret retreat unsuspected, in his mother\u2019s--in\u000ahis own--house.
p16368
aV\u201cWe\u2019ll be better alone,\u201d he said, in the stern tone which was so new to\u000ahim, putting his hand upon her chair; \u201cbut perhaps you could walk if you\u000atried,\u201d he added, with rude sarcasm.
p16369
aVHe drove rather than wheeled her before him into the deserted room,\u000awhere all was so brilliant and warm, the light blinking in the bright\u000abrass and steel, the lamps serenely burning, everything telling of the\u000atranquil life, unbroken by any but cheerful incidents, which had gone\u000aon there for so many years.
p16370
aV\u201cNow, mother,\u201d said Dolff, \u201cwe have got to have it out.
p16371
aVWho is that man\u000aupstairs?\u201d\u000a\u000aJulia had followed them unremarked, and remained behind her mother\u2019s\u000achair.
p16372
aVDolff stood before them, in the full firelight, very erect,\u000ainspired with indignation and that sense of superiority which injury\u000agives.
p16373
aVIt had elevated him altogether in the scale of being.
p16374
aVHis own\u000ashortcomings had fallen from his consciousness.
p16375
aVHe was aware of nothing\u000abut that he, Dolff, in reality the head of the family, had been deceived\u000aand compromised.
p16376
aVMrs. Harwood took but little notice of her son.
p16377
aVShe took up her work\u000awhich had been thrown upon the table and turned it over in her fingers.
p16378
aV\u201cGussy was right,\u201d she said, \u201cthough she was a little brusque in her way\u000aof saying it.
p16379
aVI am certainly unable to bear anything more to-night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI suppose, however, you can answer my question,\u201d said Dolff.
p16380
aV\u201cGo to bed, boy,\u201d said his mother, \u201cand don\u2019t worry me.
p16381
aVWe have two or\u000athree things to talk over, you and I, which are too much for to-night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am not a boy any longer,\u201d cried Dolff; \u201cyou have made me a man.
p16382
aVWho\u000ais it you have been hiding for years upstairs?\u201d\u000a\u000aShe gave vent to a little fierce laugh.
p16383
aV\u201cFor my pleasure,\u201d she said; \u201cfor my amusement, as anybody may see.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhether it is for your amusement or not,\u201d said Dolff, \u201cI am of age, and\u000aI have a right to know who is living in my house.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn _your_ house!\u201d Her exasperation was growing.
p16384
aV\u201cDon\u2019t force me, Dolff,\u000ato go into other questions to-night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhose house is it?\u201d he said.
p16385
aV\u201cThere\u2019s been no question, because you\u000ahave kept everything in your hands; but if I am to be driven to it, and\u000aclaim my rights----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYour rights!\u201d she cried, again repeating his words.
p16386
aV\u201cWas it one of your\u000arights to knock down a man like a coward from behind?
p16387
aVIt appears this is\u000awhat you think you may be permitted to do with impunity--to have your\u000ahome searched in every corner and to destroy all that I have been doing\u000afor years, and to bring shame and disgrace to a house that I have kept\u000afree of shame, almost at the risk of my life!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI did not,\u201d cried Dolff, interrupting her eagerly.
p16388
aV\u201cI did not knock\u000ahim down from behind.
p16389
aVI had not time to think.
p16390
aVI let fly at him as I\u000apassed.
p16391
aVIt\u2019s a lie to say I knocked him down from behind.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou did the same thing; you took him unawares.
p16392
aVAnd you dare to question\u000ame!
p16393
aVYou killed a man at my door--or meant to do it--and never breathed a\u000aword to warn us, to keep us from the disgrace----\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff was not clever enough to know what to say.
p16394
aVHis snort of rage was\u000anot attended by any force of bitter words.
p16395
aVHe only could repeat, with\u000arage and incompetence,\u000a\u000a\u201cAt _your_ door?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPerhaps,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, half carried away by passion, half\u000ainfluenced by the dismay which she knew she had it in her power to call\u000aforth, \u201cit would be better, since you are exact, to say at your father\u2019s\u000adoor.\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff responded with a strange cry.
p16396
aVHe did not understand it, but he\u000afelt all the same that a blow which stunned him had been directed at\u000ahim, and that the ground was cut from beneath his feet.
p16397
aV\u201cHe has neither been tried, nor sentenced, nor anything proved against\u000ahim,\u201d cried Mrs. Harwood, carried away now by the heat of her own\u000aexcitement.
p16398
aV\u201cAll that has to be gone through before he can be put aside.
p16399
aVAnd at this moment everything\u2019s his--the roof that covers you, the money\u000ayou have been spending.
p16400
aVIt is no more your house--_your_ house!--than it\u000ais Julia\u2019s.
p16401
aVIt is your father\u2019s house.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy father is dead,\u201d said Dolff, who had again grown very pale, the\u000aflush of passion dying out of his face.
p16402
aV\u201cYes,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, \u201cand might have remained so, had it not been\u000afor your cowardly folly and Vicars\u2019s infatuation for you.
p16403
aVHow was it the\u000aman had not the sense to see that a fool like you would spoil all?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are dreaming, you are mad,\u201d said Dolff; \u201cyou are telling me another\u000alie.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut, though he said this with almost undiminished passion, the young\u000afellow\u2019s superiority, his erect pose, his sense of being able to cow and\u000aoverwhelm her, had come to an end.
p16404
aVHe fell into his usual attitude, his\u000ashoulders dropped and curved, his head hung down.
p16405
aVHe could fling a last\u000ainsult at his mother, but no more.
p16406
aVAnd his own mind began to be filled\u000awith unfathomable dismay.
p16407
aVJulia had been very uncertain what side to take.
p16408
aVHer mind went naturally\u000awith her brother, who was most near herself.
p16409
aVBut a mother is a mother\u000aafter all.
p16410
aVYou may feel her to be in some way your natural enemy when\u000athe matter is between yourself and her; but when another hand plucks at\u000aher it is different.
p16411
aVA girl is not going to let her mother be insulted,\u000awho after all means her own side, without interposing.
p16412
aVJulia suddenly\u000aflew forth from behind her mother\u2019s chair and flung herself upon Dolff\u2019s\u000aarm, seizing it and shaking him violently.
p16413
aV\u201cHow dare you speak to her like that?\u201d cried Ju, \u201cyou that can\u2019t do\u000aanything you try--not even kill Charley Meredith when you have the\u000achance!
p16414
aVI should be ashamed to look any one in the face.
p16415
aVGo away, go\u000aaway, and leave us quiet, you that have done it all: that brought the\u000apolice into the house, and yet did not hurt him to speak of, you great,\u000auseless, disappointing boy!\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff did not know how to sustain this sudden assault.
p16416
aVHe looked round\u000astupidly at the active assailant at his shoulder with a little pang,\u000aeven in his agitated and helpless state, to find that Julia was no\u000alonger on his side.
p16417
aVHis head was going round and round: already in his\u000asoul he had entirely collapsed, although he still kept his feet in\u000aoutward appearance.
p16418
aVAnd it would have been difficult to end this scene\u000awithout an entire breakdown on one side or the other, had not the\u000apensive little voice of the parlor-maid become audible at this moment\u000aover their heads, making them all start and draw back into themselves.
p16419
aV\u201cIf you please, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Priscilla, \u201cfor I can\u2019t find Miss\u000aGussy--shall I take Mr. Meredith\u2019s tray to his room, or shall I bring it\u000ain here?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think Mr. Meredith is going to bed,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood; \u201che is a\u000alittle tired.
p16420
aVTake it into his room, Priscilla.
p16421
aVAnd Miss Gussy has gone\u000ato bed; you may come now and help me to get into my room, and then shut\u000aup everything.
p16422
aVIt is later than I thought.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Priscilla, in those quiet tones of commonplace which\u000acalm down every excitement.
p16423
aVPriscilla indeed was herself bursting with curiosity and eagerness to\u000afind out what had happened.
p16424
aVThe long-shut-up door stood ajar, and every\u000amaid in the house had already come to peep into the dark passage and\u000awonder what it led to: and the keenest excitement filled the house.
p16425
aVBut\u000aa parlor-maid has as high a standard of duty as any one, were it an\u000aarchbishop.
p16426
aVIt was against the unwritten household law to show any such\u000acommotion.
p16427
aVShe took hold of the handle of her mistress\u2019s chair as she\u000adid on the mildest of domestic evenings, and drew her very steadily and\u000agently away.
p16428
aVThe only revelation she made of knowing anything was in the\u000asuggestion that a little gruel with a glass of wine in it would be a\u000aproper thing for Mrs. Harwood to take.
p16429
aV\u201cYou may bring me the glass of wine without the gruel,\u201d Mrs. Harwood was\u000aheard saying as the sound of her wheels moved slowly across the hall, an\u000ahour ago the scene of such passionate agitation.
p16430
aV\u201cI don\u2019t think I have\u000acaught cold.
p16431
aVA glass of wine--and a few biscuits,\u201d she said as by an\u000aafterthought.
p16432
aVWas this part of the elaborate make-believe intended to deceive the\u000aservants and persuade them that nothing particular had happened?
p16433
aVor was\u000ashe indeed capable of munching those biscuits after such a night of\u000afate?
p16434
aV\u201cJu, don\u2019t you turn against me,\u201d said Dolff, feebly, throwing himself\u000ainto a chair when they were thus left alone.
p16435
aV\u201cOh!\u201d cried Julia, still panting with her outburst, \u201cto think you had\u000ahold of him and didn\u2019t really hurt him, not to matter!
p16436
aVI can never,\u000anever forgive you, Dolff.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, hold your tongue, you little fool; the only thing I\u2019m glad of is\u000athat I didn\u2019t hurt him--to matter!
p16437
aVYou don\u2019t know what it is to live for\u000aa long week, all the time he was insensible, thinking you have killed a\u000aman!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen it was only Charley Meredith!\u201d Julia said.
p16438
aVCHAPTER XLIV.
p16439
aVIt was strange that it should be Gussy, who was not ideal or visionary,\u000abut very matter-of-fact in all her ways, who was the most cruelly\u000aoffended and wounded by the events of this night.
p16440
aVIt seemed to Gussy\u000athat she had been deceived and played upon by everybody.
p16441
aVBy her mother,\u000awho had never confided to her the gravity of the position, though she\u000ahad known the fact for years; by Meredith, who had seemed to know more\u000aof it than Gussy did, and whose eyes had been keen with understanding,\u000afollowing every word of what was to Gussy merely the ravings without\u000aconsequence of a madman; he knew more of it than she did, who had helped\u000ato take care of the secret inmate.
p16442
aVAnd then Dolff, her brother.
p16443
aVWhat was\u000athe meaning of this cloud of tempest which had come into Dolff\u2019s\u000atrivial, schoolboyish life?
p16444
aVWhy had he tried to kill, if that was what\u000ahe wanted, or, at least, to injure, to assault Meredith?
p16445
aVIt was all a mystery to Gussy.
p16446
aVShe understood nothing except that many\u000athings had been going on in the house which she either did not know at\u000aall or knew imperfectly--that she had been possibly made a dupe of,\u000abrought down from the position which she had seemed to hold of right as\u000athe chief influence in the family.
p16447
aVShe had thought this was how it was:\u000aher mother\u2019s confidant, the nurse and guardian-angel of her lover, the\u000acontroller, more or less, of all the house.
p16448
aVAnd it turned out that she\u000aknew nothing, that there were all kinds of passions and mysteries in her\u000aown home with which she was unacquainted, that what she knew she knew\u000aimperfectly, and that even in the confidences given to her she had been\u000akept in the dark.
p16449
aVGussy was not imaginative, and consequently had little power of entering\u000ainto the feelings or divining the movements of the minds of others.
p16450
aVShe\u000awas wounded, mortified to the depths of her heart, and angry, with a\u000adeep, silent anger not easily to be overcome.
p16451
aVShe did not linger nor ask\u000afor explanations, but went straight up to her room without a moment\u2019s\u000apause, careless that both her mother, whom she generally attended\u000athrough the troublesome process of undressing, and Julia, whom she\u000ausually held under such strict authority, were left behind, the latter\u000ain contempt of all ordinary hours.
p16452
aVJanet, whose charge that was, was not\u000avisible; she had stolen away, as it had lately been her habit to do.
p16453
aVJanet, Gussy felt sure, was mixed up in it too; but how was she mixed up\u000ain it?
p16454
aVThink as she would, Miss Harwood could not make out to her satisfaction\u000ahow it could be that Janet could have influenced Dolff to assault\u000aMeredith.
p16455
aVJanet had no quarrel with Meredith, could not have.
p16456
aVHe had\u000abeen very civil to her--too civil, Gussy had sometimes thought.
p16457
aVShe\u000aremembered that there was a time when she had felt it very tiresome to\u000ahave to discuss Miss Summerhayes so often; and on the night of the ball,\u000acertainly, they had danced and talked together almost more than was\u000abecoming.
p16458
aVHow, then, could Janet have moved Dolff to attack Meredith?
p16459
aVIt\u000aseemed impossible to discern any plausible reason: and yet Gussy had a\u000amoral certainty that Janet was somehow mixed up in it.
p16460
aVCould it be that\u000athe joke about Dolff and his accompaniments had been the cause?
p16461
aVGussy\u000afelt involuntarily that it must be something more serious than that.
p16462
aVShe went to bed resolutely, for, indeed, there are times when it\u000arequires a severe effort to do this--to shut out the commotions which\u000aare around, and turn one\u2019s back upon all the questions that require\u000asolving.
p16463
aVGussy felt bitterly that she had no certainty as to what might\u000abe going on in the house, which she had lately been as sure of as if she\u000ahad created it.
p16464
aVHer mother, for anything she knew, might be going from\u000aroom to room, her chair set aside, and all her pretences with it.
p16465
aVTo\u000athink that she, Gussy, should have been taken in by it so long, and have\u000abelieved whatever was told her!
p16466
aVHer brother Dolff, so good-natured, of\u000aso little account as he was!
p16467
aVmight have caught Meredith again at a\u000adisadvantage, and have accomplished now what he tried before.
p16468
aVThe house, her calm and secure domain, seemed now full of\u000aincomprehensible noises and mysterious sounds to Gussy.
p16469
aVBut she would\u000anot even look over the banisters to see what was going on.
p16470
aVShe would not\u000aopen her door, much less steal downstairs, as another woman might have\u000adone, to find out everything.
p16471
aVShe went to bed.
p16472
aVShe asked no explanation.
p16473
aVShe shut her door and drew her curtains, and closed her eyes.
p16474
aVWhatever\u000amight be going on within or without, the gateways of her mind were\u000aclosely fastened up, so that she might hear or see no more.
p16475
aVIt was Priscilla who put her mistress to bed: and Mrs. Harwood was very\u000aangry with her children, feeling that Gussy had deserted her and that\u000aDolff had insulted her.
p16476
aVBut it takes more than that to make a woman\u000abetray her sons and daughters.
p16477
aVWith the flush of anger still on her\u000acheek and the tremble on her lips she told Priscilla how tired Miss\u000aHarwood was, how she had been overdoing herself, how she had made her go\u000ato bed.
p16478
aV\u201cI told her you could see to all I want quite nicely, Priscilla.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Priscilla; but it was doubtful how far she was taken\u000ain, for, of course, the servants knew a great deal more than they were\u000asupposed to know, and where they did not know they guessed freely, and\u000awith wonderful success.
p16479
aVIt was curious to see them all assemble in the morning at the\u000abreakfast-table as if nothing had happened.
p16480
aVNay, that was not a thing\u000athat was possible.
p16481
aVThere were traces of last night\u2019s excitement on every\u000aface; but yet they came in and sat down opposite to each other, and\u000aGussy helped Dolff to his coffee and again wondered how in all the world\u000aJanet could be the cause of his attack on Meredith: for it was evident\u000athat now, at least, Dolff was not in a state of mind to do anything for\u000aJanet.
p16482
aVHe never spoke to her during breakfast.
p16483
aVHe avoided her eye.
p16484
aVWhen\u000ashe spoke, he turned away as if he would not let her voice reach his\u000aears if he could help it.
p16485
aVHow then could Janet be mixed up in it?
p16486
aVGussy\u000awas sorely perplexed by this problem.
p16487
aVAs for Janet, though she was pale,\u000ashe put on an elaborate appearance of composure and of knowing nothing\u000awhich (in her readiness to be exasperated with everything) provoked\u000aGussy most of all.
p16488
aVShe said to herself that it was a worse offence to\u000apretend not to know when everybody was aware that she must know, than to\u000ashow her knowledge in the most irritating way.
p16489
aVNo doubt, however, that\u000aif Janet had betrayed any knowledge, Gussy would have found that the\u000amost ill-timed exhibition that could be.
p16490
aVThere was very little conversation, except between Janet and Julia,\u000aduring this embarrassing meal.
p16491
aVAnd Mrs. Harwood came out of her room as\u000ashe had gone into it, unattended by her daughters.
p16492
aVThere were less signs\u000aabout her than about any of them of the perturbation of last night.
p16493
aVSometimes an old woman will bear agitation better than the young.
p16494
aVShe\u000ahas probably had so much of it, and been compelled to gulp it down so\u000aoften!
p16495
aVHer eyes were not less bright than usual--nay, they had a glance\u000aof fire in them which was not usual in their calmer state, and the color\u000ain her cheeks was fresher than that of any one else in the house.
p16496
aVThe\u000agirls were all pale--even Julia, and Dolff of a sort of dusky pallor,\u000awhich made his light hair and mustache stand out from his face.
p16497
aVBut Mrs.\u000aHarwood\u2019s pretty complexion was unchanged--perhaps because though they\u000ahad all made so many discoveries she had made none, but had been aware\u000aof everything and of far more than any one else knew, for years.
p16498
aVEarly in the day the policeman of last night appeared with a summons to\u000aMrs. Harwood, directing her to appear before some board to show cause\u000awhy she should have kept, unregistered and unsuspected, a lunatic shut\u000aup in her house.
p16499
aVMrs. Harwood saw the man herself, and begged to be\u000aallowed to make him a little present, \u201cfor your great civility last\u000anight.\u201d The policeman almost blushed, as he was a man who bore a\u000aconscience, for he was not conscious of being very civil; but he\u000aaccepted the gratuity, let us hope, with the intention of being civil\u000anext time he was employed on any such piece of business.
p16500
aVWhile he spoke to Mrs. Harwood in the hall, whither she had been wheeled\u000aout to see him, Meredith came from his room and joined her.
p16501
aVHe had not\u000aescaped so well as she the excitement of the previous night, and it was\u000awith unfeigned astonishment that he contemplated this old lady, fresh\u000aand smiling, her pretty color unimpaired, her eyes as bright as usual.
p16502
aVShe was over sixty; she had just been baffled in an object which had\u000abeen the chief inspiration of her life for years, disappointed, exposed\u000ato universal censure, perhaps to punishment, but her wonderful force of\u000anature was not abated; the extraordinary crisis which had passed over\u000aher, breaking the bonds of her ailment, delivering her from her\u000aweakness, had left no signs of exhaustion upon her.
p16503
aVShe looked like a\u000awoman who had never known what trouble or anxiety was as she sat there\u000asmiling, assuring the policeman that she could fully explain everything,\u000aand would not fail to do so in the proper quarter.
p16504
aVShe turned to\u000aMeredith as he appeared, and held out her hand to him.
p16505
aV\u201cGood-morning, my dear Charley; I hope you are not the worse for last\u000anight\u2019s agitation.
p16506
aVYou see our friend here has come to summon me to make\u000aexplanations about my poor dear upstairs.
p16507
aVYou will appear for me and\u000asettle everything, won\u2019t you?
p16508
aVYou see this gentleman is a barrister,\u201d\u000ashe explained, smiling to the man who stood looking on.
p16509
aV\u201cOf course I will,\u201d Meredith said.
p16510
aVUpon this the policeman took courage, and with a scrape made his _amende\u000ahonorable_.
p16511
aV\u201cI ought to beg your pardon, sir, and yours too, lady, for all the\u000atrouble last night.
p16512
aVI had every confidence in Jim Harrison, the man that\u000asaid he could identify the culprit--that is the fellow as nearly killed\u000ayou, sir--and rumors have been getting up all over the place as it was\u000athe young gentleman here as had been a bit wild, and hated you like\u000apoison.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDolff never hated me like poison, did he?\u201d said Meredith, elevating his\u000aeyebrows and appealing to Mrs. Harwood.
p16513
aV\u201cNever!
p16514
aVyou have always been one of his best friends.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell,\u201d said the officer, who was not too confident either in this\u000aassurance or in the conclusion he had been obliged to come to, \u201cthere\u000awas a parcel of tales about.
p16515
aVYou can never tell how them tales gets up.
p16516
aVHowever, it\u2019s all been a mistake: for when Jim sees your young gentleman\u000ahe says in a moment, \u2018Nothing of the sort--that\u2019s not \u2018m.\u2019 So it all\u000afalls to the ground, as you\u2019ll see, sir, being used to these questions,\u000aas the lady says--for want of evidence.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cExactly,\u201d said Meredith, \u201cand you\u2019ll do me the justice to say, officer,\u000athat I told you it would from the first.
p16517
aVIt\u2019s worth while occasionally\u000ataking a man\u2019s advice that knows something about it, you perceive,\u000ainstead of your Mr. Jim, who evidently knows nothing but what he thinks\u000ahe saw or didn\u2019t see.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s it, sir, I suppose,\u201d said the policeman, \u201cand if he did see it,\u000aor if he didn\u2019t I couldn\u2019t tell, not if it was as much as my place was\u000aworth.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe would have looked rather foolish though, don\u2019t you think, in the\u000awitness-box?
p16518
aVYou see,\u201d added Meredith, with a laugh, \u201cyou might have\u000aspared this lady the trouble of last night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, I don\u2019t see that, sir,\u201d said the policeman, promptly, \u201cfor if it\u000adidn\u2019t answer one purpose, it did another.
p16519
aVI\u2019m very sorry to upset a\u000alady, but she didn\u2019t ought to bottle up a madman in a private house\u000awithout no register, nor information to the commissioners, nor proper\u000aprecautions.
p16520
aVYou know that, sir, just as well as me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow do you know that the lady has no license?\u201d said Meredith, \u201cor that\u000aher relation\u2019s illness is not perfectly known?
p16521
aVI think you will find a\u000alittle difficulty in proving that: and then your superiors will be less\u000apleased with the discovery.
p16522
aVHowever, that\u2019s my business, as Mrs. Harwood\u000ahas confided it to me,\u201d he added, with a laugh, which he could not\u000arestrain, at the man\u2019s sudden look of alarm.
p16523
aV\u201cDon\u2019t find fault with our friend; he was as civil as it was possible to\u000abe.
p16524
aVGood-morning, and thank you,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, sitting, with her\u000aplacid smile, watching her visitor, stiff and uneasy in his plain\u000aclothes, as he went away.
p16525
aVWhen the door was shut upon him by Priscilla, who sniffed and tossed her\u000ahead at the necessity of being thus civil to a man who had made so much\u000acommotion in the house--much as she and her fellow-servants had enjoyed\u000athe excitement--Mrs. Harwood\u2019s countenance underwent a certain change.
p16526
aVThe smile faded; a look of age crept round the still beaming eyes.
p16527
aV\u201cIf you will wheel me back to my room, Charley, we can talk,\u201d she said.
p16528
aVShe could not but be conscious that he was thinking, asking himself why\u000ashe could not walk, she who had found power to do so when she wanted it;\u000abut she betrayed no consciousness of this inevitable thought.
p16529
aVShe was\u000avery grave when he came round from the back of her chair and stood\u000afacing her in the firelight, which, on a dull London morning in the end\u000aof January, was the chief light in the room.
p16530
aVPerhaps the dreary\u000aatmosphere threw a cloud upon her face.
p16531
aVHer soft, half-caressing tone\u000awas gone.
p16532
aVShe had become hard and businesslike in a moment.
p16533
aV\u201cYou want me\u000ato explain,\u201d she said.
p16534
aV\u201cIf you please.
p16535
aVYou know how much my father was involved: that craze\u000aabout the money to be paid back means something.
p16536
aVEven a mad repetition\u000alike that seems likely to have a foundation in fact.
p16537
aVIs it true?\u201d\u000a\u000aShe bent her head a little, and for the moment cast down her eyes.
p16538
aV\u201cIt was true.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt _was_ true; then you have alienated----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWait a little.
p16539
aVThere were no such creditors as his own children, who\u000awould have been ruined had not I saved them.
p16540
aVThey know nothing of any\u000aquestion of money.
p16541
aVThey knew nothing of----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOf his existence at all--till last night?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am bound to furnish you with every information I can.
p16542
aVThe young ones\u000aknew nothing of his existence.
p16543
aVGussy did; but only that I kept him there\u000ato save him from an asylum where he might have been treated\u000acruelly--nothing more.
p16544
aVYou will not take a high moral tone against me,\u000aas she is ready to do, and Dolff----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo; I will take up no high moral tone,\u201d said Meredith; \u201cbut the\u000aposition is very difficult.
p16545
aVYou have not, I suppose, done away with the\u000amoney?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is well invested; it is intact.
p16546
aVWe could not have lived as we have\u000adone on my own money.
p16547
aVNow, of course, I must give it up---- And no\u000ainjustice need be done,\u201d she added, with a sigh; \u201cit can be paid--at\u000alast.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWith interest for all these years?\u201d said Meredith, with a smile.
p16548
aV\u201cOh, what are you talking of?\u201d She said, \u201cPeople will be so glad to get\u000aanything so unexpectedly, that they will say nothing about interest.
p16549
aVI\u000aeven think----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat do you even think?\u201d he said, as she paused.
p16550
aV\u201cHow can I tell how you may take it, whether it will commend itself to\u000ayou or not?
p16551
aVThere might still be an arrangement by which things might\u000abe--tided over.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAfter it gets into the papers and it is known that you have been\u000aconcealing----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh,\u201d she cried again, \u201cyou are more dull than I gave you credit for\u000abeing, Charley Meredith!
p16552
aVWho will notice up in Liverpool a romantic\u000astory (which is all the papers will make of it) occurring in St. John\u2019s\u000aWood?
p16553
aVWho will link one thing to another and understand exactly what has\u000ahappened, or believe that---- I might have taken him in, a miserable\u000awreck, out of sheer love and kindness.
p16554
aVI did!
p16555
aVI did!\u201d she cried,\u000asuddenly, her face melting out of its hardness, her eyes filling with\u000atears.
p16556
aV\u201cYou may not believe me, but I did.
p16557
aVI thought he had not a penny.
p16558
aVI went to all the expense of fitting up the wing for him--working with\u000amy own hands at it, that nobody should suspect--believing that Vicars\u000ahad brought him back with his own money--that _he_ had none---- I did,\u000athough you may not believe me,\u201d she said.
p16559
aV\u201cI have not said I did not believe you.
p16560
aVWe are all very queer\u000acreatures--mixed up.
p16561
aVAnd then when you found he had that old\u000apocketbook--for it was full of something better than old papers\u000athen--you were tempted, and you----\u201d\u000a\u000aShe nodded her head; then said, after a while,\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not accept that formula.
p16562
aVI was tempted--and I did what I had a\u000aright to do.
p16563
aV_I_ had wronged nobody--I knew nothing about the debts.
p16564
aVIf\u000aI had divided _that_ among them, what would it have been?--a trifle to\u000aeach, but enough to dry up all the sympathy they were meeting with.
p16565
aVHe\u000ahad made ducks and drakes of more than that belonging to me.
p16566
aVAnd the\u000achildren were the most deeply wronged.
p16567
aVI took it for their sakes, to\u000amake up what they had been robbed of.
p16568
aVIt can go to the others now, and\u000ayou will see how much it will be.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou said something,\u201d said Meredith, \u201cabout an arrangement that might\u000astill be made?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes--if you could lend yourself to it, Charley.
p16569
aVIt could not be done\u000awithout you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI cannot tell whether I could lend myself to it or not, until I hear\u000awhat it is.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe looked at him, and two or three times made as if she would speak,\u000abut shut her lips again.
p16570
aVHer eyes searched his face with an anxious\u000aexpression.
p16571
aV\u201cI don\u2019t know how you will take it,\u201d she said, hesitating; \u201cI don\u2019t know\u000ahow you will take it.\u201d Then, after a pause, she added, \u201cI will begin by\u000aasking you a question.
p16572
aVDo you want to marry my daughter Gussy?
p16573
aVYes or\u000ano!\u201d\u000a\u000aMeredith made a step backwards, and put his hand to his breast as if he\u000ahad received a blow.
p16574
aVIn that moment various dreams swept through his\u000amind.
p16575
aVJanet\u2019s image was not the only one, though it had the freshness of\u000abeing the last.
p16576
aVOne of those dreams, indeed, was no other than the\u000afreedom of his own bachelor estate, and the advantage of life which was\u000anot bound by any social ties.
p16577
aVHe avowed, however, at length, soberly,\u000a\u000a\u201cI think I may say yes, Mrs. Harwood--that is it what has been for a\u000along time in my mind.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER XLV.
p16578
aVThe conduct of affairs in the house of the Harwoods was very dreary\u000aduring the whole of this day.
p16579
aVIt was, to begin with, a very dreary day,\u000anot fog, which can be borne, but one of those dark days which are the\u000ascourge of London, when everything is dull and without color without and\u000awithin, the skies gray, the earth gray, the leafless branches rising\u000alike a black tracery upon the colorless background, the light scarcely\u000aenough to swear by, to make it seem unnatural to shut the shutters and\u000alight the lamp, which is what every well-constituted mind desires to do\u000ain the circumstances.
p16580
aVAnd in the moral atmosphere the same thing reigned.
p16581
aVGussy had a\u000acountenance like the day.
p16582
aVShe, who had at no time much color, had now\u000anone.
p16583
aVShe was like the landscape: hair, eyes, and cheeks seemed the\u000asame.
p16584
aVEvery glimmer of light seemed to have been suppressed in her eyes.
p16585
aVShe kept them down, or she turned their gaze inward, or she veiled them\u000awith some film which is at the command of those who are angry, whether\u000awith or without cause.
p16586
aVShe made no inquiry even after the health of\u000aMeredith, which had been hitherto her chief preoccupation, except in so\u000afar as was implied in the conventional \u201cHow d\u2019you do?\u201d with which they\u000amet.
p16587
aVEven he was daunted by the determined indifference of her aspect.
p16588
aVWhen he talked of the drive which the doctor had suggested to him as a\u000apreliminary to getting out on foot, Gussy never lifted her eyes or made\u000athe least inquiry.
p16589
aVYesterday this step of decided progress would have\u000abeen the most exciting event in the world to her.
p16590
aVShe took no notice of\u000ait now.
p16591
aVThere was scarcely anything said at table when they took their\u000amidday meal, with a candle or two lit on the mantelpiece, \u201cto add a\u000alittle cheerfulness,\u201d as Mrs. Harwood said.
p16592
aV\u201cFor certainly we are not a very cheerful party,\u201d added the mother, who\u000awas more full of life than all the rest put together.
p16593
aVShe it was who took the lead in the conversation till Gussy retired.
p16594
aVShe\u000atalked to Meredith and a little to Janet, whom this curious aspect of\u000athe family interested greatly, though she did not quite understand it.
p16595
aVBut Gussy and Dolff both sat bolt upright and said nothing.
p16596
aVThey ate\u000anothing, too, which, perhaps, was a more effectual weapon against their\u000amother\u2019s heart, and, when luncheon was over, they separated gloomily,\u000aDolff disappearing no one knew where, Gussy to her room, where she said\u000ashe had something to do while Mrs. Harwood retired with Meredith,\u000abetween whom and herself a curious intimacy seemed to have struck up, to\u000athe dining-room, his room as it was called, to talk there.
p16597
aVIn this universal gloom and strangeness Julia drew Janet out into the\u000agarden.
p16598
aVThe day grew darker as it approached its end, the atmosphere\u000abecame more yellow, signs as of a fog appeared in the air.
p16599
aVThe governess\u000aand the pupil put on their ulsters, and began to walk up and down the\u000agarden walks, Julia hanging with all her might upon the arm of her\u000acompanion, dragging down Janet almost to the ground.
p16600
aV\u201cDid you ever know,\u201d Julia said, \u201csuch a detestable day?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is turning to fog,\u201d said Janet, trying to keep to what was\u000acommonplace.
p16601
aV\u201cIt was better that we did not go out.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, was I thinking of the fog?\u201d said Julia.
p16602
aV\u201cI would rather see a dozen\u000afogs than Gussy shut up like that, pursing up her lips as if she were\u000aafraid something would drop out when she spoke.
p16603
aVAnd poor Dolff, so\u000adismal, not knowing what to do with himself.
p16604
aVJanet, do you think there\u000acould be any truth in all that story about Dolff?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear,\u201d said Janet, \u201chow should I have any opinion?
p16605
aVI cannot be\u000asupposed to know about your brother, what he is likely to do.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh,\u201d said Julia, \u201cI did not ask you what you know, but what you\u000a_think_; everybody must have an opinion.
p16606
aVBesides, after all, it is not\u000aso very little that you know about Dolff.
p16607
aVHe has been at home for six\u000aweeks, and you have always seen a great deal of him; at least I am sure\u000ahe has always tried to see as much as he could of you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think,\u201d said Janet, \u201cthat it is very bad taste for us to discuss\u000apeople, especially for you to talk with me about your own family.
p16608
aVYou\u000aforget that I am the governess, Julia.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think you are very nasty, and not nice at all.
p16609
aVWhoever thinks of you\u000aas the governess!
p16610
aVI wonder what you mean, saying such unkind things.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey are not unkind, they are true.
p16611
aVYour mother and Gussy have been\u000avery good to me, but----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, Janet, when you know we were very fond of you, and we thought you\u000awere fond of us!\u201d\u000a\u000aHere Janet was suddenly visited by a great compunction which changed at\u000aonce her countenance and her feelings.
p16612
aV\u201cJulia,\u201d she said, \u201cdon\u2019t speak to me.
p16613
aVI feel so horrible sometimes, I\u000adon\u2019t know what to do with myself.
p16614
aVI don\u2019t think I am nice or good at\u000aall.
p16615
aVPerhaps,\u201d she added with a faint revulsion of self-defence after\u000athis impulsive confession, \u201cit is not quite my fault.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t understand you,\u201d said Julia.
p16616
aV\u201cI ask you a question, quite a\u000asimple question, and you go off into reproaching yourself and saying you\u000aare not nice.
p16617
aVWhat I want to know is whether you think it was Dolff that\u000aknocked Charley Meredith down?
p16618
aVIf it was, he has not had the strength of\u000amind to stick to it, as I should have done.
p16619
aVAnd what do you think that\u000aman meant who came to identify him, and then said it wasn\u2019t he?
p16620
aVAnd do\u000ayou think that man last night really meant anything about Dolff, or did\u000athey only pretend to find out about the wing?
p16621
aVAnd, oh, Janet, did you\u000aever know, did you ever suspect anything about the wing?
p16622
aVPlease don\u2019t\u000arun away to other subjects, but tell me what you think.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhere am I to begin?
p16623
aVI can\u2019t answer all those questions at once.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh,\u201d said Julia, with impatience, \u201chow tiresome you are to-day!
p16624
aVYou\u000adon\u2019t want to answer me at all.
p16625
aVDo you remember that first night when\u000ayou heard that cry, and were so frightened?
p16626
aVI had heard it before, but\u000amamma told me it was nothing, it was the wind in the empty rooms.
p16627
aVOne\u000athinks it strange,\u201d said Julia, \u201cbut at first one is stupid, you know,\u000aand just believes anything.
p16628
aVBut you see you were right; and you didn\u2019t\u000alook surprised at all, not even to see mamma walking upstairs, she who\u000anever moves.
p16629
aVOr, do you think she only pretends not to be able to move,\u000ato take us all in?\u201d Julia added, after a pause.
p16630
aV\u201cOh, Julia, hush!
p16631
aVHow dare you say such a thing of your mother?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is because she has deceived us about things,\u201d said Julia, hanging\u000aher head.
p16632
aV\u201cIt was Dolff that said so, not me.
p16633
aVShe has deceived us in one\u000athing, and how are we to believe her in another.
p16634
aVBoth Dolff and Gussy\u000athink so, though Gussy says nothing; to think she has kept it secret all\u000athis time, and never let even the elder ones know: and how can we tell\u000aif it is not a deceit about the chair, too?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you had seen how she tore herself out of it last night!
p16635
aVIt was only\u000aher misery and anxiety that gave her power to do it.
p16636
aVIt is very hard to\u000ajudge any one like that.
p16637
aVI daresay,\u201d said Janet, indignantly, \u201cthat the\u000aother was done for your sakes, too, not to trouble you, when you were\u000astill so young, with knowing what was a great secret, I suppose?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh, but why was it a secret?
p16638
aVand who do you think the man is, Janet?\u201d\u000asaid Julia, clinging ever and ever closer to her arm.
p16639
aV\u201cJulia, what have I to do with the secrets of your family?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy, you are one of the family,\u201d said Julia; \u201cyou can\u2019t help knowing;\u000aand again I tell you, Janet, it isn\u2019t what you know, it\u2019s what you think\u000aI am asking.
p16640
aVWhy don\u2019t you give me your opinion?
p16641
aVevery one must have an\u000aopinion.
p16642
aVDolff and I, we don\u2019t know what to think.\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff himself came hurriedly up behind the girls at this moment.
p16643
aVHe had\u000anot gone out after all.
p16644
aV\u201cWhy do you trouble Miss Summerhayes, Ju?
p16645
aVIt is very interesting for us,\u000abut not for--a stranger----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is what I have just been saying, Mr. Harwood.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c--Who can\u2019t take any particular interest, except just as a wonder and a\u000athing to talk about, in what happens to us?\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff\u2019s hands were thrust to the very bottom of his pockets, his\u000ashoulders were up to his ears, his head upon his breast.
p16646
aVGloom and anger\u000aand misery were on Dolff\u2019s face.
p16647
aVAs for Janet, she had stiffened more\u000aand more with every word he said, and Julia, who had been clinging, with\u000aall a child\u2019s affection, to the arm of her governess, felt herself\u000arepulsed and detached, she could not tell how, and protested loudly:\u000a\u000a\u201cJanet, because Dolff is disagreeable that\u2019s no reason for shaking me\u000aoff!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have no intention of being disagreeable,\u201d said Dolff, walking slowly\u000awith them.
p16648
aV\u201cI only say what every one must perceive to be the fact.
p16649
aVWe\u000ahave all supposed there was a miracle to be performed, and Miss\u000aSummerhayes was to think of us as if--as if--she was, as you say, Ju,\u000aone of the family; but she does not feel like that; our affairs are\u000anothing to her--only something that is odd and makes a story to talk\u000aabout, as they would be to any other stranger.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, if you are going to quarrel!\u201d said Julia, \u201cyou had better get it\u000aover between yourselves.
p16650
aVI don\u2019t like people who are quarrelling.
p16651
aVYou\u000ahad better have it out with him, Janet, and then perhaps he will not be\u000aso dreadful as he has been all these days.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is nothing for us to quarrel about.
p16652
aVI am, as Mr. Harwood says,\u000aonly a stranger,\u201d said Janet, endeavoring to hold the girl\u2019s hand upon\u000aher arm.
p16653
aVBut Julia slipped it out and ran indoors, not without a thought that she\u000ahad managed matters well.
p16654
aVJulia had long ago made up her mind that a\u000aromantic attachment between Dolff and Janet would add great interest to\u000aher own life, and that the probable struggles of a love that would not\u000arun too smooth would be very desirable for a young lady to witness.
p16655
aVAnd\u000aDolff, under Janet\u2019s influence, had been so much \u201cnicer\u201d than Dolff\u000awithout that.
p16656
aVHe had stayed at home; he had been ready for anything\u000a(though there was always too much of that horrid music), he had not\u000aobjected even to a round game.
p16657
aVIt was true that all these domestic\u000apleasures had come to an end since Charley Meredith\u2019s accident.
p16658
aVBut\u000aJulia, in her inexperience, could not see why they might not come to an\u000aexplanation and \u201cget over it,\u201d and everything go on as before.
p16659
aVJanet did not follow her pupil as she would have liked to do.
p16660
aVShe\u000aconsented to the explanation as it seemed necessary, but she neither\u000ahoped nor intended that everything should go on as before.
p16661
aV\u201cYes,\u201d said Dolff, \u201cyou are only a stranger, Miss Summerhayes.
p16662
aVMy\u000amother, I think, took to you as if you had been her own, and everybody\u000awas at your feet, but you did not respond--that is to say, you were very\u000akind, and the things you could not help but see, being in the house with\u000aus, though we never saw them who belonged to it, you told--as amusing\u000aincidents, I suppose, to----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat did I tell, Mr. Harwood?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, I have not been taken into anyone\u2019s confidence.
p16663
aVYou gave\u000ainformation--you heard him say it--which made a secret meeting\u000anecessary, and--all that followed.
p16664
aVOne might say,\u201d said Dolff, with a\u000acheerless laugh, \u201cthat everything had followed.
p16665
aVI went mad, I suppose,\u000afor a little while; and you know as well as I do what I did.
p16666
aVOh, I am\u000avery well aware that you know.
p16667
aVYou saved me in your way after you had\u000aruined me.
p16668
aVFellows say that women are like that--driving you mad first,\u000aand then---- But I never was one that talked about women--till I knew\u000ayou.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am very sorry,\u201d said Janet, \u201cto have given you a bad opinion of\u000awomen; but I don\u2019t know why Mr. Meredith----\u201d Here her voice faltered a\u000alittle in spite of herself.
p16669
aV\u201cAh!\u201d cried Dolff, fiercely, \u201cyou have found out that fellow is not\u000aworth his salt, yet you could cry when you say his name.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is nothing of the sort,\u201d exclaimed Janet.
p16670
aV\u201c_I_ cry--for any man in\u000athe world!
p16671
aVYou don\u2019t know me, Mr. Harwood.
p16672
aVMr. Meredith, I remember,\u000awalked home a part of the road with me, as it was a dark night.
p16673
aVThere\u000aare some men who think that is a right thing when they meet a lady\u000aalone; and, though I am the governess, I am not very old.
p16674
aVI think it\u000avery old-fashioned, and unnecessary, and I am not afraid to go anywhere\u000aalone.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou know very well if you had wished for an escort, Miss\u000aSummerhayes----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, Mrs. Harwood would have liked her son to be at the command of the\u000agoverness!
p16675
aVMr. Meredith walked home with me out of a civility which is\u000aold-fashioned, and he stood talking, which it seems is his way--with\u000aladies.
p16676
aVA man like that,\u201d said Janet, almost fiercely, \u201cwill never learn\u000athat all girls are not alike, and that some detest these old-fashioned\u000aways of being polite.
p16677
aVBut there was not in all that any reason for\u000aknocking the man down.
p16678
aVI supposed when I saw it that you were, perhaps,\u000aworking out some old quarrel.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou thought,\u201d said Dolff, grinding his teeth, \u201cthat I had watched him,\u000aand flew at him, by premeditation, to take him at a disadvantage--not\u000abecause I was driven mad to see him holding you by the hands.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow could I know one thing or another?
p16679
aVThere was no reason for anyone\u000abeing mad about me: I can take care of myself without anyone\u000ainterfering.
p16680
aVBut I did not want any scandal, I do not want to be mixed\u000aup in it; when a girl\u2019s name is mentioned it is always she that gets the\u000awhole blame.
p16681
aVYou know what they say, \u2018Oh, there was a woman at the\u000abottom of it.\u2019 Now, I had done nothing wrong, I was not at the bottom of\u000ait.
p16682
aVWhatever you choose to say, it was no doing of mine.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOne of the things that fellow says,\u201d said Dolff, \u201cis that a woman has\u000aalways reasons to show she is never wrong.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey say everything that is brutal and cruel,\u201d said Janet, with a sound\u000aof tears in her voice, \u201cand therefore I was determined not to be mixed\u000aup in it: and I did my best to save you from what was--not a very fine\u000aaction, Mr. Harwood.
p16683
aVYou did take him at a disadvantage.
p16684
aVI don\u2019t doubt\u000athat you were very angry, though you had no reason----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you think it was all for you!\u201d cried Dolff, transported with boyish\u000apassion and anxious to give a blow in his turn.
p16685
aV\u201cBut to think of that\u000afellow, jeering and laughing at everybody, those who trusted in him----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou see,\u201d said Janet, with a smile, \u201cthat I was right when I said I was\u000anot at the bottom of it!\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff gave her a look which might have killed her where she stood, had\u000athe fire which passion struck even from his dull eyes been effectual,\u000aand yet which had in it a strange mixture of love and hate.
p16686
aVHe was not\u000aclever enough, however, to note that in Janet\u2019s smile there was a\u000amixture, too, of malicious triumph and of mortification; for,\u000anotwithstanding all that she had said, it would no doubt have been more\u000aagreeable to Janet\u2019s pride to have been told that the sudden assault was\u000aentirely on her own account from fierce jealousy and passion.
p16687
aVShe was a\u000alittle girl who was full of reason, and understood the complication of\u000athings, yet there was enough of the primitive in her to have been\u000apleased, even had she not fully believed it, by such an asseveration as\u000athat.
p16688
aV\u201cIn that case,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you have to find fault with\u000ame.
p16689
aVI did my best to smooth it all away that nobody might have known\u000aanything.
p16690
aVWhat use is there in telling things that are so easily\u000amisrepresented?
p16691
aVIf it would shock anyone who trusted in him to know that\u000aMr. Meredith had walked home with the governess----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh,\u201d cried Dolff, \u201cyou will drive me out of my senses!
p16692
aVwho calls you\u000athe governess, Miss Summerhayes?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do myself,\u201d said Janet, \u201cit is my right title.
p16693
aVI never have been one\u000aof those who despise it; but if it would vex anyone--who trusted in\u000ahim--to hear that Mr. Meredith had walked home because it was dark and\u000alate with the----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are very anxious to defend Meredith,\u201d said Dolff, bitterly.
p16694
aV\u201cAm I?\u201d cried Janet.
p16695
aVThere was a dart out of her eyes at that moment\u000athat was more powerful than any dull spark that could come from Dolff\u2019s.
p16696
aV\u201cIf I am,\u201d she added, with a laugh, \u201cit is only for the sake of those\u000awho, as you say, trust in him, Mr. Harwood.
p16697
aVFor me I find those\u000aold-fashioned ways of his intolerable.
p16698
aVHe is like a man in an old\u000anovel,\u201d cried Janet, \u201cwho kisses the maid and gives her half-a-crown,\u000aand is what is called civil to every girl.
p16699
aVIt is eighteenth-century--it\u000ais mock Lovelace--it is the most antiquated vanity and conceit.
p16700
aVAnd he\u000athinks that he takes people in by it, which shows how foolish and\u000aimbecile it is, besides being the worst taste in the world!\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff stared open-eyed at this tirade.
p16701
aVHe had a faint idea that Lovelace\u000ameant a seductive villain, but what Meredith had to do with the\u000aeighteenth century, or how he was old-fashioned, this young man, devoid\u000aof literature, understood not at all.
p16702
aVHe did understand, however, that\u000aJanet was angry with Meredith, and this went to his heart.
p16703
aVThe dull\u000ayellow sky began to look a little clearer.
p16704
aVIt became a possibility that\u000athings might brighten, that a new world might arise, that these misty\u000ashadows might blow away.
p16705
aV\u201cIf I could think,\u201d he said, \u201cthat you ever could forget all this, Miss\u000aSummerhayes.
p16706
aVI heard you taking my mother\u2019s part with Ju: and you are\u000athinking of Gussy, who doesn\u2019t deserve it very much, perhaps, and you\u000ahave saved me: for I never could have faced it out but for what you said\u000ato me--though I have seemed so ungrateful: and if you think it possible\u000athat we could all forget what has happened--in time----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo,\u201d said Janet, \u201cI think there are several things in it which neither\u000ayou nor I could ever forget.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am not so sure,\u201d said Dolff.
p16707
aV\u201cIt would depend upon you.
p16708
aVIf you would\u000apromise never to see or speak to----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhom?\u201d said Janet, rising several inches out of her shoes, and looking\u000adown upon him with a glance that froze Dolff; and then she added,\u000ainterrogatively, \u201cFor you?\u201d and, turning round upon her heel, walked\u000aaway into the house without a glance behind.
p16709
aVCHAPTER XLVI.
p16710
aVJanet was passing quickly through the hall, coming from the garden by\u000athe long passage which led past the kitchen and pantry, and turning\u000around to go upstairs, when she found herself suddenly caught as she\u000awent along.
p16711
aVSome one took hold of the end of the long boa which was\u000around her neck and detained her.
p16712
aVShe was a little startled and\u000afrightened at first, thinking instinctively of the mad tenant of the\u000awing, and that now the door was no longer fastened between him and the\u000ahouse.
p16713
aVHer fears, however, were instantly put to flight, and feelings\u000avery different substituted in their stead, when a voice said,\u000a\u000a\u201cJanet!
p16714
aVstop a moment and speak to me, I am very lonely here.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have no need to be here, or to be lonely unless you like,\u201d she\u000acried, hurriedly; \u201cand call me by my proper name, please.
p16715
aVI can be only\u000aMiss Summerhayes to you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t say so.
p16716
aVYou were not so hard upon me the other night.
p16717
aVAh!
p16718
aVI\u000aforgot; it\u2019s not the other night, it\u2019s three weeks ago.
p16719
aVStop a moment;\u000adon\u2019t pass without saying a word.
p16720
aVYou ought to pay me a little\u000aattention, considering all that I have suffered since--for you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFor me!\u201d she cried.
p16721
aV\u201cI am sorry that you have suffered, but it was not\u000afor me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you think for a moment that that lout would have sprung on me as he\u000adid if it hadn\u2019t been for you?
p16722
aVYou know better, Janet.
p16723
aVI owe it to you,\u000amy dear, that I was beaten flat like a pancake, and had my head dashed\u000aagainst the stones, as they did, you know, in the psalm.
p16724
aVNo, Janet; be\u000aquiet and listen to me.
p16725
aVI\u2019ve paid dear for one bit of an interview, and\u000ayou ought to give me some recompense.
p16726
aVI\u2019ve lain upon my back all these\u000amany days for you, and it\u2019s for you that I grin at that fellow, instead\u000aof taking him by the throat!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat does me no good,\u201d said Janet, panting with excitement and alarm.
p16727
aV\u201cLet me go, please.
p16728
aVI would rather die than be found talking to you\u000ahere.
p16729
aVTake him by the throat if you please.
p16730
aVWhat is that to me?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo save you from trouble,\u201d said the other.
p16731
aV\u201cDon\u2019t you think I have felt\u000ahow unpleasant it would be to have your name coming out?
p16732
aVThat is why I\u000ahave let him off, for that reason and no other.
p16733
aVCome, talk to me a\u000amoment, I deserve it.
p16734
aVNobody will hear us; Gussy is out, and the mother\u000ashut up in her room.
p16735
aVI\u2019m very forlorn in this house, which I had better\u000aleave, I think, at once; I\u2019m well enough, I suppose, to do so now----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t you want to leave it?
p16736
aVShall you not be glad to get away?\u201d cried\u000aJanet, under her breath.
p16737
aV\u201cGlad to get away!
p16738
aVwhen you are here, you little witch.
p16739
aVDo you think it\u000ahas been pleasant to go on all the time purred over by the others, and\u000anever getting a word with you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou will not,\u201d said Janet, with perhaps a certain revengeful pleasure,\u000a\u201cbe purred over by the others any more.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou think so?\u201d he said.
p16740
aV\u201cDon\u2019t you be too sure.
p16741
aVIf you disdain me, and\u000arefuse to hear me, there is no telling, they may purr again.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOne way or other,\u201d said Janet, \u201cit has nothing to do with me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy do you say so?
p16742
aVAre you going to be sent away?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSent away!\u201d Janet breathed forth the words as in a gale of indignation.
p16743
aV\u201cNobody,\u201d she cried, \u201cexcept myself, shall send me away.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cand yourself will not, I hope?
p16744
aVIt would be a changed\u000ahouse if you were gone.
p16745
aVAll the spirit and the understanding and the\u000amischief--don\u2019t be angry, Janet; there is nothing so enchanting as\u000amischief, and you know you are full of it--would be gone.
p16746
aVI doubt if I\u000ashould ever come back to the place again.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMr.
p16747
aVMeredith,\u201d said Janet, \u201cyou have no right to speak to me so.
p16748
aVIt is\u000aunpardonable in a man.
p16749
aVWho is to believe you?
p16750
aVMiss Harwood, whom I\u000abelieve you are engaged to all this time--or me, whom you venture to\u000atake hold of and--talk to, when you think nobody sees?
p16751
aVOh, it is quite\u000aunpardonable, Mr. Meredith!
p16752
aVIs it her or is it me whom you want to\u000aplease?
p16753
aVYou ought to know.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat sounds very like asking me my intentions,\u201d he said, with a laugh,\u000a\u201cas the father does in novels, or sometimes the mother.
p16754
aVBut never, so\u000afar as I recollect, the young lady herself.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet was angry, and she was sore.
p16755
aVShe had been made of no account among\u000athem; she who was very well aware of her own value, and had never been\u000aignored by those around her before, had been lately treated as if she\u000awere nobody in this house.
p16756
aVIt had been necessary for her to conceal her\u000aown movements, to be prudent, to take the most urgent measures that her\u000aname should not suffer.
p16757
aVBut it had galled her to the very heart that\u000aMeredith should have spoken of her as a mere means of receiving\u000ainformation, and even that Dolff should have ignored her part in the\u000amatter, though it was what she wished him most to do.
p16758
aVShe was full of\u000ainconsistency in this respect, as most human natures are, and as women\u000ain particular are expected to be.
p16759
aVNot to be mixed up in it was her most\u000aurgent desire, but to be ignored, though it was what she desired most,\u000awas bitter to her heart.
p16760
aVIt had given her a certain amount of\u000asatisfaction to assert her superiority to Dolff, and she would have been\u000astill more pleased now could she have done the same with Meredith, and\u000aissued from the double complication triumphant, setting both men in\u000a\u201ctheir proper place,\u201d and proving that she was not deceived by either,\u000abut above both.
p16761
aVBut it was not so easy with Meredith as with Dolff.
p16762
aVShe\u000ahad played with the youth who was not so clever as she, nor her equal in\u000aanything, but alas!
p16763
aVit was she who had been played with in the other\u000acase, and her attempt to change the _rle_ was not likely to be very\u000aeffectual.
p16764
aVShe did not love Meredith--she was angry with him, and more or less\u000adespised him: but he had a charm for her which some men have for women,\u000aand some women for men, not only without merit on the part of the\u000aenchanter, but even with a distinct feeling of disapproval and almost\u000acontempt on that of the enchanted.
p16765
aVThis was her feeling towards Gussy\u2019s\u000alover.
p16766
aVHe _was_ Gussy\u2019s lover, probably for all she knew Gussy\u2019s\u000abetrothed; yet he had dared to play with her, to set up a secret\u000aunderstanding, to persuade her that he loved her best.
p16767
aVHe did not love her at all, she declared to herself indignantly; he\u000aloved nobody except himself, he cared for nothing except to be amused,\u000ato have the best of everything, to gather sweetness on every side.
p16768
aVShe\u000ahad thrown him aside indignantly in the moment of trial when he had been\u000afound wanting, and when she, too, had found herself wanting, and\u000ainstinctively defended herself by dropping him.
p16769
aVAnd yet now when Janet\u000awas suddenly brought face to face with him again, and there was a moment\u000agiven her in which to express her final sentiments, one of those curious\u000areturns upon herself which come in every such history came over her.
p16770
aVIt\u000awas always possible that in the human mind there should be a complete\u000achange of sentiment, that the balance should turn at a touch, and truth\u000aand love vanquish all evil.
p16771
aVThe most conventional and the most lively\u000aand imaginative of minds acknowledge this possibility.
p16772
aVIt is called\u000aconversion in religion, in other matters it bears a less important\u000atitle: yet it is always a possibility.
p16773
aVA man who has been an egotist may\u000abecome suddenly generous and tender; a man who has resisted every\u000ainducement to do well, and broken every heart that loved him, may by\u000asome more subtle touch be changed, and turned from his evil ways.
p16774
aVSuch a\u000athing is always possible: and Janet, when she addressed Meredith in her\u000aindignation, had some such feeling in her mind.
p16775
aVHe had a charm for her\u000anotwithstanding her anger against him, her sense of wrong, and the\u000ano-faith she had in him; but yet he had a charm: and it was possible\u000athat something she might say, some argument struck out in the heat of\u000athe moment, might still convert him to honor and to truth.
p16776
aVThat was, to Janet\u2019s version of honor and truth, which was, perhaps, a\u000aone-sided one.
p16777
aVIt was according to all her canons that the man finding\u000ahimself not to love his _fiance_ but to love another, should sacrifice\u000aeverything to that other, and leave the _fiance_ to bear it as she\u000amight.
p16778
aVThis would have been the triumph of love over worldliness and\u000aconventionality in Janet\u2019s eyes.
p16779
aVShe would not have felt it wrong for\u000ahim to prefer herself, to give up Gussy: and it was quite in his power\u000ato hold by Gussy and give up herself; but one thing she felt must be\u000adone, and that at once.
p16780
aVShe would not allow him to go on, detaining her,\u000amaking love to her, telling her in words and otherwise that he loved her\u000abest, if he meant after all to marry Gussy.
p16781
aVIt had to be now decided\u000aonce for all.
p16782
aV\u201cSince you say so,\u201d she said, with her heart beating, \u201cI will not object\u000ato the word.
p16783
aVI am not frightened by words: and I have neither father nor\u000amother.
p16784
aVOh, don\u2019t think I forget what you said about that last time you\u000aasked me to meet you in the shop, that it was to receive information.
p16785
aVAnd now you stop me and want to begin again, in a way very different\u000afrom getting information.
p16786
aVYes, I want to know what you mean.
p16787
aVIt is quite\u000atrue: which of us is it you want to please?
p16788
aVAnswer me!\u201d cried Janet,\u000astamping upon the floor with her foot.
p16789
aV\u201cIs it her, or is it me?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAlas, that it can\u2019t be both!
p16790
aVMy dear child, I should like to please you\u000aboth, if that is how you put it,\u201d said Meredith.
p16791
aVIt was so dark that she could scarcely see his face, but he had twisted\u000athe long boa round his arm, so as to bring her nearer to him.
p16792
aVShe stamped her foot again upon the ground, and began to loosen her boa.
p16793
aV\u201cAnswer me!\u201d she said.
p16794
aV\u201cDon\u2019t put a poor fellow in a corner, Janet.
p16795
aVI have to temporize like\u000aother people.
p16796
aVYou have almost made me lose my head; but I can\u2019t afford\u000ait, don\u2019t you know.
p16797
aVI can\u2019t throw things up like that: and there\u2019s no\u000ahurry--we\u2019re all young enough; let us wait and see what may turn up.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIs that all you have got to say?\u201d said Janet, uncoiling the boa from\u000aher throat.
p16798
aV\u201cWhat can any one say more?
p16799
aVYou women have the most confounded way of\u000aputting a fellow in a corner.
p16800
aVThere\u2019s no need for any such desperate\u000adecision.
p16801
aVLet us wait a bit and enjoy ourselves as much as we can in the\u000ameantime,\u201d said Meredith, manipulating the boa on his side.
p16802
aVShe left it suddenly in his hand, and quickly and noiselessly turned\u000aaway, flying upstairs almost before he could call her back: and Meredith\u000adid not venture to call \u201cJanet, Janet!\u201d in more than a subdued tone.
p16803
aVHe\u000adared not follow her, he did not want anybody to know of that colloquy\u000ain the hall, though he had risked it, and would have prolonged it,\u000aperhaps, to the very edge of discovery.
p16804
aVWhen he felt the boa dropped\u000aupon his hands he laughed to himself, with amusement mingled with a\u000acertain discomfiture, to think how much in earnest these girls were--and\u000ahe was not at all in earnest.
p16805
aVHe liked to take the goods the gods had\u000aprovided, and get all the pleasure he could out of them; but to\u000acompromise his own future and bind himself forever was what he would not\u000ado for anyone: and perhaps he was half pleased to have got through the\u000adangerous amusement of that interview, though it was he who had sought\u000ait and prolonged it, so easily upon the whole.
p16806
aVHe had not been made to\u000acommit himself to anything, and yet he flattered himself he had made no\u000abreach.
p16807
aVThings were just as they had been before.
p16808
aVHe was not like a\u000amarried man, or one who had come under solemn engagements; there was no\u000areason that he should give up what was agreeable to him, yet, at least;\u000abut it amused him to see Janet\u2019s high spirit, her impatience, and even\u000athose questions which it was ludicrous, yet a little confusing, to be\u000aasked by her--about \u201chis intentions,\u201d as he said.
p16809
aVEven the sudden\u000aconclusion of the interview by which she betrayed her impatience, her\u000adispleasure was amusing to him.
p16810
aVHe felt all the more fond of her, amused\u000aand flattered by her anxiety to know what he meant, and pleased that she\u000ahad not made much of her bold attempt.
p16811
aV\u201cThe little vixen!\u201d he said to himself.
p16812
aVHe gathered up the boa, which\u000awas of a kind which slips through unused fingers, and laid it carefully\u000aupon the table.
p16813
aVIt escaped him once, as its mistress had done, and had\u000ato be caught again, and laid in soft, dark coils on the table, which was\u000aa thing that pleased him, and made him laugh again.
p16814
aVJanet was in a great\u000afright lest her conversation with him should be discovered, and she\u000awould by no means have liked it to be discovered, yet it gave him a\u000apungent pleasure to linger and keep her there, and feel that she had\u000afled on the very eve of detection, and get away himself to the shelter\u000aof his room, just as Gussy outside put her latch-key in the door.
p16815
aVHe laughed as he heard her come in and call to Priscilla to light the\u000alamps, and that the hall was so dark she could scarcely see her way\u000aupstairs.
p16816
aVJanet had found her way upstairs like a bird a minute before.
p16817
aVHe chuckled at the thought that in another moment it might have been too\u000alate: and yet he had no desire at all that Gussy should find out that\u000ameeting in the dark.
p16818
aVAs for Janet, she hurried to her room with hot indignation in her heart\u000aand the water in her eyes.
p16819
aVOh, it was not that she expected it to have\u000aended in any other way!
p16820
aVShe had known exactly how it would be.
p16821
aVHe was\u000anot a man to behave like a man, to love one and no more.
p16822
aVWhat he wanted\u000awas his own pleasure and advantage, not Gussy and not Janet.
p16823
aVShe\u000adespised him for it all, for the subdued tone in which he had attempted\u000ato call her back, for his way of putting off everything that was\u000aserious: and she half despised herself for having asked, as he said,\u000a\u201chis intentions,\u201d and allowed him to see that she cared.
p16824
aVShe did care, she said to herself, dashing the tears from her eyes.
p16825
aVShe\u000ahad a contempt for him, and penetrated his character with the keenest\u000aperception, and to say that she loved him would have been a great\u000aexaggeration: and yet he had a charm for Janet--his mockery, his laugh,\u000athe tone of his voice, almost his want of respect and bold appropriation\u000aof her, whether she wished it or not, had a charm.
p16826
aVHer heart would have\u000adanced with pleasure had he given her an assurance of love (which he\u000amight very well have done, she knew, without in the least meaning it),\u000aand yet she had penetrated him through and through, and had no illusion\u000aas to his character.
p16827
aVAll motives are mingled, but Janet\u2019s were so\u000amingled that she did not understand them.
p16828
aVShe was humiliated by the\u000aresult of her endeavor, yet highly excited, her heart leaping in her\u000abreast: she sat down as she was, in her hat and coat, to think it all\u000aover.
p16829
aVDolff and Meredith had both revealed their affection more or\u000aless--they had both allowed her to see into their hearts.
p16830
aVAnd Janet,\u000athough she had provoked it in both cases, was angry, mortified, full of\u000afury and pain.
p16831
aVThat was what men were incapable of, she thought--any\u000areal feeling, but for themselves and themselves only.
p16832
aVEven Dolff, who\u000ahad been her slave, would have consented now to forget everything, if\u000ashe would give him her promise.
p16833
aVShe to him!
p16834
aVas if he would give any\u000apromise or act otherwise than as pleased himself!
p16835
aVJanet sat for a long time pondering over the half-extinguished fire, her\u000aheart full of anger, disappointment, and contempt.
p16836
aVIt was themselves\u000athey had both thought of, never of her!
p16837
aVAt one time they had made her\u000abelieve that she was everything, queen of their hearts, and for a moment\u000ashe had been so silly as to be half-intoxicated, believing in it,\u000aaccepting the high compliment, but now----.
p16838
aVShe suddenly sprang up under\u000athe impulse of the shock at the dictation of a new idea.
p16839
aVThey might be\u000aunworthy, but there were some who were worthy.
p16840
aVOh, what did it matter\u000athat they should have youth and a fair appearance, or any of those\u000aadventitious gifts.
p16841
aVIt was better to be true and real.
p16842
aVIt occurred to\u000aher suddenly that instead of going away to another family to exercise\u000athe mystery of a governess, instead of being liable to be dismissed, as\u000aMeredith so coarsely had suggested, instead of the state which was\u000aoffensive to Janet\u2019s own good taste and feeling, of covert hostility to\u000aher employers, which she had fallen into so readily, and which in\u000aanother house it was horribly possible she might fall into again--how\u000amuch better it would be to go out proudly in the eye of day, as good as\u000aany of them, as independent, with a life of her own to fall back upon!
p16843
aVJanet flew to her writing-table at this new thought, and wrote, as quick\u000aas the pen would form the letters, a hasty letter.
p16844
aVIt was all done at\u000aflying speed, without taking time to think, a hurried, blurred, as she\u000afelt unladylike production.
p16845
aVShe thrust it into an envelope, directed it,\u000aand rushed downstairs with it to take it herself to the post, not to\u000alose a moment.
p16846
aVThe hall was now lighted but abandoned--nobody there to\u000acall to her, to bid her pause, to stop her on the way.
p16847
aVHer boa lay on\u000athe table carefully coiled round and round.
p16848
aVJanet snatched it up, as if\u000athat had been an additional reason for speed, and rushed out to decide\u000aher fate.
p16849
aVCHAPTER XLVII.
p16850
aVIn the evening they were all assembled in the drawing-room once more.
p16851
aVThe same party with so many differences.
p16852
aVThere were only Mrs. Harwood\u000aand Meredith who were unchanged.
p16853
aVShe sat in the usual warm corner, with\u000athe usual white fleecy knitting, which never changed, in her lace cap\u000aand white shawl, with her pretty complexion and her smiling looks, the\u000awoman of whom people said that she must have lain in the lilies and fed\u000aon the roses of life to preserve that wonderful complexion and eyes so\u000aclear and so bright.
p16854
aVAnd he, looking so much better--really assured in\u000ahis health, the tints of weakness going off, the high color which was at\u000aonce his characteristic and the drawback to his good looks coming back,\u000aand his high spirits as if they had never had any check.
p16855
aVIt was only\u000alast night that he had been following up that discovery with the\u000aeagerness of a bloodhound, forgetting everything but the scent on which\u000ahe was following on to the end.
p16856
aVAll that had now flown away.
p16857
aVHe was the\u000aCharley Meredith of old, playful and ready to \u201cchaff\u201d everybody round,\u000atalking of the new songs and what would suit \u201cour\u201d voices, and lamenting\u000athe interrupted \u201cpractisings.\u201d Charley was as if nothing had happened,\u000afull of fun, eager for amusement, calling upon the mother for sympathy\u000aand encouragement.
p16858
aV\u201cThey have all become so grave,\u201d he said.
p16859
aV\u201cIt is you and I, Mrs.\u000aHarwood, that will have to perform our duet.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, \u201cif I had been twenty years younger, there\u000ais no telling what might have happened.
p16860
aVI should not have kept you\u000awaiting, Charley.
p16861
aVI wish, Gussy, you would not look as if you had been\u000ato a funeral this afternoon.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot this afternoon--but something a little like it, mamma.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are talking great nonsense, my dear.
p16862
aVIf there is anybody that ought\u000ato be cast down, it is surely me.
p16863
aVAll my troubles have been forced back\u000aupon me; but I have the comfort of knowing,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, with a\u000aslightly raised voice, \u201cthat I never meant any harm--and that I have\u000adone none--and that the last people in the world to criticise me are my\u000achildren: so I desire that there shall be an end of this.
p16864
aVI have been\u000asummoned, as I expected, to explain everything: and Charley has kindly\u000apromised to appear for me and clear it all up--and secure permission for\u000ame to look after my poor dear upstairs, as I have done ever since he was\u000aafflicted.
p16865
aVWhen I have made it all clear with the Lunacy commissioners I\u000amay perhaps be supposed to have done enough, though one can never know.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMamma,\u201d said Gussy, \u201cthere was no need for anything but to be frank and\u000aopen.
p16866
aVYou have not been open--not to me, who was taken more or less into\u000ayour confidence.
p16867
aVI suppose you were compelled to tell me something, but\u000anot all, or nearly all.
p16868
aVA child could see there is more in it than meets\u000athe eye.
p16869
aVAnd now I presume you have taken Mr. Meredith into your\u000aconfidence, but none of your children.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy _Mr._ Meredith?\u201d said he, with a smile, putting out his hand for\u000ahers.
p16870
aVGussy made no reply.
p16871
aVShe gave him a look of indignant reproach.
p16872
aVIn point\u000aof fact, when he asked her thus, she could not have told why--after all.
p16873
aVThe truth began to steal into her mind, like the influence of a thaw,\u000athat after all he had done nothing.
p16874
aVHe had been curious to fathom the\u000asecret in the house.
p16875
aVSo would any one have been.
p16876
aVAnd there was something\u000aabout information that he had received--where or from whence could he\u000ahave received information?
p16877
aVBut even that, she suddenly reflected, could\u000anot be his fault.
p16878
aVIf he had been told anything it would be difficult not\u000ato listen.
p16879
aVThus, though she gave him a look of reproach and drew away\u000aher hand, it suddenly occurred to Gussy that after all there was no\u000aparticular reason why she should call him Mr. Meredith, or consider him\u000aas deeply to blame.
p16880
aVThe thaw had begun.
p16881
aVDolff had kept behind backs all the evening.
p16882
aVHe took no seat, he\u000aattached himself to none of the party.
p16883
aVFor some time he had been seated\u000ain a large easy-chair which almost swallowed him up, in the other part\u000aof the room, reading, or pretending to read.
p16884
aVThen when the conversation\u000abegan he had risen from that place, and walked about in the half-light\u000alike an uneasy ghost.
p16885
aVNow he came into the talk with a voice that\u000asounded far off, partly because of the length of the room, and partly\u000abecause of the boyish gruffness which, as a token of high contrariety\u000aand offence, he had brought into his voice.
p16886
aV\u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat Lunacy commissioners have to do with it in\u000acomparison with the people in the house.\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Harwood turned her chair round as much as she was capable of doing,\u000aand cast a look into the dim depths of the other room.
p16887
aV\u201cIt is a pity,\u201d she said, \u201cthat the commissioners could not be of your\u000aopinion, Dolff; it would have saved me a great deal of trouble.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI can\u2019t see,\u201d he said, irritably, \u201cwhy you should have taken such\u000atrouble upon you at all.
p16888
aVWhat is the man to you?
p16889
aVWho is he that you\u000ashould have taken such trouble for him?
p16890
aVYou have no brother that I ever\u000aheard of.
p16891
aVMother,\u201d said Dolff, coming forward out of the gloom, \u201cI have\u000acudgelled my brains to think who it could be.
p16892
aVIs it possible that for a\u000amere stranger--a man who is no relation to us--you should have risked\u000aall our comfort and separated us from you?
p16893
aVI have heard of such things,\u201d\u000asaid the young man, working himself up, \u201cbut to find them out in one\u2019s\u000amother whom one has always respected----\u201d\u000a\u000aShe gave a wondering look round upon them all and then burst into a\u000astrange confused laugh.
p16894
aV\u201cIn the name of wonder,\u201d she cried, \u201ccan anybody tell me what the boy\u000ahas got in his head?
p16895
aVwhat does he mean?\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat did he mean?
p16896
aVThey all looked at each other with perplexity; even\u000aJanet, rousing from the rigid unmeaningness to which she had condemned\u000aherself, to take share in the glance of amazement which ran round.
p16897
aVOnly\u000aMeredith did not share that amazement.
p16898
aVHe laughed, which was a sound\u000athat made Dolff frantic, and brought him a step forward with his hand\u000aclenched.
p16899
aV\u201cDolff, my good fellow,\u201d he said, with an air of superior experience\u000awhich still further irritated the furious lad, \u201cdon\u2019t fly upon me again:\u000afor that sort of argument doesn\u2019t do much good in a discussion.
p16900
aVAnd\u000adon\u2019t bring your ideas out of French novels here.
p16901
aVSuch things are a\u000agreat deal worse when they are translated than when they are at home.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d cried Dolff, \u201cwith your French novels!
p16902
aVnor\u000awhat right you have to be here, in the midst of us all, discussing a\u000asubject--a subject which--a subject that--makes me,\u201d cried the young\u000aman, \u201cthat I cannot endure myself, nor the house, nor so much as my\u000amother\u2019s name.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat does he mean?\u201d said the ladies to each other, looking all round\u000awith perturbed looks.
p16903
aVThey were all united, from Julia to her mother, in\u000athe wonder to which they had no clue.
p16904
aVEnglishwomen, brought up in the\u000avery lap of respectability, not knowing even the alphabet of shame, full\u000aof faults, no doubt of their own kind, but utterly incapable even of\u000aimagining the secret horror and suspicion that lurked in Dolff\u2019s words,\u000athey could do nothing but send round that troubled look of consultation.
p16905
aVWas Dolff going out of his senses, _too_?
p16906
aVWas it perhaps in the family,\u000athis dreadful thing, and had it assailed the boy?
p16907
aVMrs. Harwood grew pale\u000awith sheer fright and horror as she looked back upon her son, and then\u000apitifully consulted his sisters with her eyes.
p16908
aV\u201cDolff,\u201d cried Meredith, in a warning tone, \u201cmind what you are about, my\u000aboy.
p16909
aVI tell you to bring none of your French novels here.
p16910
aVThey don\u2019t\u000aexplain the situation.
p16911
aVStrike me if you like then; but don\u2019t be such an\u000aeverlasting fool.
p16912
aVPierre et Jean, eh, _here!_\u201d cried the elder man, with\u000aa half shriek of derisive laughter.
p16913
aVHe sat with a sort of careless\u000acourage, not putting himself even into an attitude of defence, but on\u000ahis guard, looking towards the enraged youth--an air which transported\u000aboth the young feminine hearts beside him into an ecstasy of admiration,\u000athough Gussy was so deeply offended (she began to think more and more\u000awithout reason), and Janet more deeply still, hating and despising him\u000aas she thought.
p16914
aVGussy darted forward between her brother, who had the air of springing\u000aupon his senior, and Meredith, warning Dolff in her turn with a loud\u000acry.
p16915
aV\u201cMind,\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cwhat you are about!
p16916
aVAs Charley says, enough has\u000ahappened already.
p16917
aVWe will tolerate no more in this house.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet rose too, scarcely knowing why she did it, she who had so solemnly\u000amade up her mind that on no provocation would she take any part.
p16918
aV\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat Mr. Dolff means; but I hope no one will\u000abe angry if I say I found some papers torn in little pieces under the\u000awindows of the wing.
p16919
aVI thought they were from an old copy-book and that\u000athey were Mr. Dolff\u2019s.
p16920
aVI am sure now they belonged to the poor gentleman\u000aupstairs.
p16921
aVThey were signed \u2018Adolphus Charles Harwood.\u2019 I have no right\u000ato be here at all, and I am going away.\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff stood breathless, feeling the light fail in his eyes.
p16922
aVHe saw\u000aMeredith spring up and open the door for her, and with a pang watched\u000awhile the little dark figure disappeared.
p16923
aVFor the moment he was only\u000aaware of her disappearance, of the final going out as he thought in\u000aeternal darkness of the little light which had made his life so\u000adifferent.
p16924
aVHe came back to himself with a gasp when the door closed, but\u000ascarcely knew what had been said to him for the beating of the pulses in\u000ahis head.
p16925
aV\u201c\u2018Adolphus Charles Harwood\u2019?\u201d said Julia, thoughtfully; \u201cthen that, I\u000asuppose, is the poor gentleman\u2019s name; so, Dolff, you see I was right,\u000aand it was a relation after all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is Pierre et Jean, Charley?\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, sitting up a\u000alittle more erect than usual, with a kindling in her eyes.
p16926
aV\u201cIt is a very clever French novel--far more clever and better than\u000amost--a very fine piece of work.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut with something in it,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, \u201clike our circumstances?
p16927
aVYou must bring it to me to read it, Dolff.
p16928
aVIf I did not burden your\u000aminds with a secret, which would have done you no good, and been hard,\u000ahard to keep----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen,\u201d he said, interrupting her abruptly, \u201cit is a relation?
p16929
aVbut even\u000athat I never heard of before.
p16930
aVHow is it that there should be a man of\u000athat name in the family, and I should never have heard of him before?\u201d\u000a\u000aHe still stood on the defensive, his face flushed with anger, and a\u000asense of being wrong and inferior to all the rest somehow, though he\u000acould not tell how.
p16931
aVIt is strange how difficult it sometimes is in such a discussion, when\u000athere is one whose invincible ignorance holds out in face of all\u000aargument and proof, to say the single word which will cut the knot.
p16932
aVIt\u000awas on Gussy\u2019s lips to say it; but she did not, perhaps because Dolff\u2019s\u000awant of comprehension was so curious to them all.
p16933
aVAnd at this moment,\u000aalmost before he could be replied to, there arose a little commotion in\u000athe hall.
p16934
aVJanet\u2019s voice was heard in a faint cry, and there was a\u000ashuffling of feet, and another unknown male voice rising in the quiet.
p16935
aVJulia, who was awake like a dog to all new sounds, rushed to the door\u000aand flung it open, and then there became visible the strangest sight.
p16936
aVThere stood upon the threshold an old man in a strange dress, something\u000abetween a long coat and a gown, with a white beard on his breast, long\u000awhite hair streaming on his shoulders, and a long pallid face.
p16937
aVHis\u000aappearance was so sudden, so unlooked-for, like a stage entrance without\u000awarning, that the effect was more startling and wild than could be\u000aimagined.
p16938
aVIt was as if the conversation, in which so many complications,\u000aso many misunderstandings, were involved, had been suddenly embodied in\u000athis bizarre and extraordinary figure which was its cause.
p16939
aVAnd, as if to\u000amake it more extraordinary still, this strange apparition held by the\u000ahand, with her arm drawn through his, Janet, pale, terrified, and\u000afaintly struggling, who had left the room but a moment before.
p16940
aVJanet was evidently wild with terror, yet did not dare even to try to\u000aescape except by the strain of reluctance in her whole figure, drawing\u000aback while he drew her forward.
p16941
aVThe most benignant aspect that is\u000acompatible with a disordered brain was in the madman\u2019s face.
p16942
aVHe smiled\u000aas he held her, dividing the fingers of the hand he held with his own,\u000aas if he were caressing and playing with a child.
p16943
aVHe stood for a moment\u000acontemplating them all, taking in the details of the picture which on\u000atheir side they made, with that pleased, half-bewildered, half-imbecile\u000alook, and nodding his head from one to another, like one of those\u000anodding figures that go on indefinitely.
p16944
aVThe weakness of the smile, the\u000aglow of foolish satisfaction in his face, the endless nodding, took much\u000afrom the majesty of the venerable patriarchal figure, and made him look\u000amore like a silly old man than a picturesque and tragical lunatic.
p16945
aVWhile\u000athey all stood thunderstruck, he advanced into the room with a buoyant,\u000aalmost dancing step.
p16946
aV\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201chere I am, Julia.
p16947
aVI suppose that you expected me?
p16948
aVThis\u000ais a merry meeting: here\u2019s to our merry meeting.
p16949
aVVicars says I am so\u000amuch better--and so I am, quite well--don\u2019t you see I have a color in my\u000acheeks--that I may come downstairs.
p16950
aVHe is a very good fellow, Vicars;\u000abut I want society.
p16951
aVJulia, see what I\u2019ve got here.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe drew Janet forward, nodding at her with the most complacent looks,\u000awhile the poor little girl, deadly pale, trembling with terror, hung\u000aupon his arm as if suspended by a hook, holding back, yet not daring to\u000astruggle, shutting her eyes for very terror.
p16952
aVHe waved his hand,\u000areleasing hers for a moment, but holding it tight within his arm.
p16953
aV\u201cAnother of them?\u201d he said.
p16954
aV\u201cWhere does she come?
p16955
aVI don\u2019t seem to\u000aremember what we called her, or where she comes in the family; but a\u000anice little thing, Julia--with some feeling for her old--for her\u000aold--eh?
p16956
aVI forget what I was going to say.
p16957
aVWhat is her name?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAdolphus!
p16958
aVlet the child go.
p16959
aVHere is a chair by me: come and sit down.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey all stood about helpless, gazing, Mrs. Harwood alone keeping her\u000aplace in her chair, while he strayed across the floor in his\u000ahalf-dancing step, dragging Janet with him.
p16960
aV\u201cI\u2019ll sit by you with pleasure, Julia.
p16961
aVIt is long since you have come to\u000asit with me till last night.
p16962
aVAnd these are all of them?
p16963
aVI\u2019ve said their\u000anames over in my mind, but I forget some--I forget some.
p16964
aVThey were so\u000alittle once--curious to think so little once, and then when a man comes\u000aback--tse!
p16965
aVin a moment all grown up--the same as men and women.
p16966
aVBut\u000athis,\u201d he said, with a laugh, \u201cis still a little thing.
p16967
aVWhere shall I\u000aput her, Julia?
p16968
aVToo big, you know, to sit on papa\u2019s knee.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe laughed again, looking round upon them all, and suddenly let Janet\u000ago, so that she fell in the shock of the release, which made the\u000astranger laugh more and more.
p16969
aV\u201cPoor little sing!
p16970
aVbut too big to tumble about.
p16971
aVDet up again and don\u2019t\u000aky. Julia,\u201d he put out his hand again and laid it on the elbow of Mrs.\u000aHarwood\u2019s chair, \u201cthese are all then?--between you and me----\u201d He rubbed\u000ahis long soft pallid hands.
p16972
aV\u201cWho would have thought,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I should have got so well, and\u000acome downstairs again and sat by you in another chair, and seen them all\u000amen and women.
p16973
aVIt\u2019s more than we could have expected--more than we could\u000ahave expected.
p16974
aVAnd now there\u2019s a great deal to be done to show that\u000awe\u2019re thankful.
p16975
aVWhere is my pocket-book?
p16976
aVI want my pocketbook.
p16977
aVGod in\u000aheaven!
p16978
aVthat villain Vicars has taken my pocket-book, and now I shall\u000anot be able to pay!\u201d\u000a\u000aHe started up again in rising excitement, his eyes beginning to stare\u000aand his face to redden, while he dragged and pulled at the pockets of\u000ahis coat.
p16979
aVMrs. Harwood put her hand upon him to pull him down into his\u000achair, and called to them all to find Vicars.
p16980
aV\u201cSit down, sit down, Adolphus,\u201d she said, holding him with both her\u000ahands.
p16981
aV\u201cIt is in your other coat.
p16982
aVYou changed your other coat to come\u000adown, you know you did.
p16983
aVRun--run, Dolff!
p16984
aVfor the love of heaven, and get\u000athe pocket-book out of your father\u2019s other coat!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER XLVIII.
p16985
aVDolff hurried out of the room so bewildered and dazed that he neither\u000aunderstood what this new revelation was, nor what he was sent out to do.
p16986
aVHe felt himself hustled out of the room by his anxious sisters, while\u000aMeredith was left to be the defender of the party against the madman.
p16987
aVThe madman!
p16988
aVWhat was it his mother had said.
p16989
aVTo fetch Vicars--but that\u000awas not all--to get something out of his father\u2019s coat.
p16990
aVHis father!
p16991
aVDolff stopped a few steps from the door, out of which he had been thrust\u000ato run in haste and bring what was wanted out of his father\u2019s coat.
p16992
aV\u201cMy father,\u201d Dolff said to himself, \u201chas been dead since ever I can\u000aremember.
p16993
aVWho is my father?\u201d He was completely bewildered.
p16994
aVHe remembered\u000ahis mother very well in her widow\u2019s cap.
p16995
aVAnd she was known everywhere to\u000abe a widow.
p16996
aV\u201cYour father!\u201d--he could not think what it meant.
p16997
aVHe\u000abelieved there must be some mistake, some strange illusion which had\u000afallen upon them, or which, perhaps, they had thought of, invented, to\u000aprevent remark.
p16998
aV\u201cYour father!\u201d could it have been said only to shut his\u000amouth?
p16999
aVIt was due to Providence, not to Dolff, that Vicars came in his way,\u000adrifting across the hall in pursuit of his patient.
p17000
aVVicars had the\u000afamous pocket-book in his hand, and Dolff wondered vaguely what was the\u000ameaning of it, and how it was that this pocket-book, like a property on\u000athe stage, should be so mixed up with the poor man\u2019s thoughts, if these\u000adistracted fancies could be called thoughts.
p17001
aVAll that he could do was to\u000apoint towards the drawing-room, whither Vicars hastened.
p17002
aVHe had no\u000acommand of his voice to say anything, or of himself to be able to\u000aexercise his own wits.
p17003
aVHe dropped in his dismay upon one of the hard\u000awooden chairs in the hall, and sat there staring vaguely before him,\u000atrying to think.
p17004
aVThere was a faint jar of the door, and a little figure came out\u000aabruptly, as if escaping.
p17005
aVIt was Janet, whose smooth hair was a little\u000aout of order, and her black dress crushed by the half embrace in which\u000athe madman had held her.
p17006
aVJanet was deeply humiliated by that embrace, by\u000ahaving thus appeared before Meredith and all of them, the object of the\u000aold man\u2019s fondling.
p17007
aVHer face was obscured by anger and annoyance, and\u000awhen Dolff sprang up and put himself in her way, the little governess\u000alooked for a moment like a little fury, contemplating him with a desire\u000ain her eyes to strike him to dust if she had been able--a fiery little\u000aGorgon, with the will without the power.
p17008
aV\u201cWhat is it--what is it _now_?\u201d she cried, clenching her hand as if she\u000awould have struck him, yet at the same moment holding herself in with\u000adifficulty from a fit of angry tears.
p17009
aV\u201cJanet, don\u2019t forsake me,\u201d cried Dolff; \u201cI am half mad, I don\u2019t know\u000awhat to think.
p17010
aVWho is he?
p17011
aVTell me who he is!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMr.
p17012
aVHarwood,\u201d cried Janet, fiercely, \u201cyou--you are not a wise child.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe looked at her with a naive wonder.
p17013
aV\u201cI have never set up for being wise.
p17014
aVYou are far, far more quick than I\u000aam.
p17015
aVI suppose you understand it, Janet.
p17016
aVI know you don\u2019t care for me, as\u000aI do for you; but you might feel for me a little.
p17017
aVOh, don\u2019t turn away\u000alike that--I know you\u2019ve thrown me off; but help me--only help me.
p17018
aVWho\u000ais he?
p17019
aVTell me who he is.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMr.
p17020
aVHarwood,\u201d said Janet, \u201chow should I know your family history?
p17021
aVHe is\u000ayour father; any one can see that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is impossible,\u201d said Dolff; \u201cmy father is dead.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOf course, I cannot know anything,\u201d said Janet, with a cruel intention\u000awhich she did not disguise from herself, with her lip a little raised\u000aover her white teeth like a fierce little animal at bay, \u201cbut I will\u000atell you what I think.
p17022
aVYour father has done something which made it\u000abetter that he should be thought dead, and your mother has hidden him\u000aaway and kept him a close prisoner all these years: but now it is all\u000afound out.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDone something--that made it better he should be thought dead!\u201d Dolff\u000aturned so deadly pale that the girl\u2019s heart smote her.
p17023
aVThe place seemed\u000ato turn round and round with him.
p17024
aVHe fell back against the wall as if he\u000awould have fallen.
p17025
aV\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that!--you don\u2019t mean that!\u201d he\u000acried, piteously, stretching out his hands to her as if she could help\u000ait.
p17026
aV\u201cOh!
p17027
aVforgive me, Mr. Dolff.
p17028
aVI did not mean to hurt you so.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNever mind about hurting me,\u201d he said, hoarsely.
p17029
aV\u201cIs it true?\u201d\u000a\u000aShe made no reply; what did she know about it?
p17030
aVPerhaps it was not\u000atrue--but what else could any one think who was not a fool?
p17031
aVIf Dolff had\u000anot been a fool he would have known that it must be so.
p17032
aVShe stood\u000aconfronting him for a minute while he stood there supporting himself\u000aagainst the wall, hiding his face in his hands.
p17033
aVAnd then Janet left him,\u000arunning upstairs to escape altogether from these family mysteries, with\u000awhich she had nothing to do.
p17034
aVIt had been very interesting at first, full\u000aof excitement, like a story.
p17035
aVBut now Janet felt that it was a great\u000aconsolation to have nothing really to do with it, to retire and leave\u000athese people to manage their own affairs.
p17036
aVAnd she had in her veins an\u000aentirely new excitement, something of her own enough to occupy all her\u000athoughts.
p17037
aVShe ran upstairs, leaving Dolff in his dismay with his head hidden in\u000ahis hands--what had she to do with that?--and fled to her comfortable\u000aroom, where she sat down beside the blazing fire, and turned to her own\u000aaffairs--they were important enough now to demand her full attention.
p17038
aVSince she had written that letter, Janet herself had become subject to\u000aall the suspenses, the doubts and alarms of independent life.
p17039
aVWhat would\u000abe thought of it?
p17040
aVWould he still be in the same mind?
p17041
aVWould he come to\u000atake her away?
p17042
aVAnd oh, biggest and most serious of all her questions,\u000aif he did come, if he were still of the same mind, could she endure\u000ahim--could she accept the fate which she had thus invited for herself?
p17043
aVJanet had serious enough questions of her own to discuss with herself as\u000ashe sat over the glowing fire.
p17044
aVPoor Dolff did not know how long he stood there, with his head against\u000athe wall.
p17045
aVHe was roused at last by the sound of a movement in the\u000adrawing-room, and presently the door opened, and a sort of procession\u000acame out.
p17046
aVFirst of all, the strange new inmate of the house leaning upon\u000aVicars, looking back and kissing his hand to the others behind him, who\u000acame crowding out in a group close to each other.
p17047
aV\u201cI\u2019ll come often now and sit an hour with you in the evening,\u201d he said.
p17048
aV\u201cNow that everybody\u2019s paid, I\u2019ll live a new life.
p17049
aVMy children, don\u2019t be\u000afrightened; I\u2019ll take care of you all.
p17050
aVFor,\u201d he said, stopping short,\u000aturning Vicars round by the arm, \u201cI\u2019m to have a wheeled chair and go out\u000afor an airing to-morrow.
p17051
aVHey, what do you think--an airing!
p17052
aVThat means\u000ait\u2019s all paid and everything right.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI wouldn\u2019t, if I were you, say the same thing over not more than twenty\u000atimes,\u201d said Vicars, sulkily; \u201cand you won\u2019t have no airing, I can tell\u000ayou, if you don\u2019t come off to bed.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s Vicars all over,\u201d said the smiling patient.
p17053
aV\u201cVicars all over!
p17054
aVYou would think he\u2019s my master--and he\u2019s only my servant!
p17055
aVYes--yes, it\u2019s\u000aall paid, and everything right--or how could I go out for an airing\u000ato-morrow?
p17056
aVThere is plenty in the pocket-book for everybody.
p17057
aVYou\u000aknow--in the pocket-book.
p17058
aVEh!
p17059
aVMy!
p17060
aVWhere\u2019s my pocket-book?\u201d he cried,\u000asuddenly changing his tone and searching in his breast-pocket.
p17061
aV\u201cVicars,\u000ado you hear?
p17062
aVMy pocket-book!
p17063
aVWhere\u2019s my pocket-book?
p17064
aVIt\u2019s not where I\u000aalways have it--I keep it here, you know, to keep it safe.
p17065
aVMy\u000apocket-book!\u201d cried the poor maniac, tossing Vicars from him and waving\u000ahis arms wildly.
p17066
aVHis distracted eyes caught at this moment the figure of Dolff standing\u000aagainst the wall.
p17067
aVDolff had uncovered his pale and miserable\u000acountenance: he was standing in the shade, mysterious, half seen, with\u000athat very pale face looking out from the semi-dark.
p17068
aVThe madman rushed\u000atowards him with a cry.
p17069
aV\u201cThere\u2019s the thief!
p17070
aVThere\u2019s the thief!
p17071
aVGet hold of him before he gets\u000aaway!
p17072
aVHe\u2019s got my pocket-book--lay hold of him!
p17073
aVI\u2019m not strong enough,\u201d\u000ahe added, turning round with an explanatory look, \u201cto do it myself.
p17074
aVNever getting any air you know, as I couldn\u2019t till things were settled.
p17075
aVI\u2019ve got very little strength.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI thought,\u201d said Vicars, \u201cas taking that pocket-book from him was a\u000amistake!
p17076
aVHe\u2019s always a-looking back upon that pocket-book!
p17077
aVYou\u2019ll have\u000ato give it him back.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t you remember, sir,\u201d said Meredith, holding up a sealed packet,\u000a\u201cthat you gave it to me to put it up--look at the seals, you stamped\u000athem yourself.
p17078
aVYou gave it to me to pay off everything.
p17079
aVTry to remember.
p17080
aVHere it is, safe and sound.
p17081
aVYou gave it to me yourself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd who the devil are you,\u201d said the invalid, \u201cthat I should give you\u000aall my money?
p17082
aVYou\u2019re not one of them: some fellow, Vicars, that Julia\u000ahas picked up.
p17083
aVShe\u2019s always picking people up.
p17084
aVGive it back, make him\u000agive it back, Vicars--my money that\u2019s meant to pay off everybody!
p17085
aVGive\u000ait back--back!
p17086
aVI tell you I\u2019ll pay them all myself!
p17087
aVI\u2019ll go out\u000ato-morrow in the wheel-chair--you know, Vicars, the wheel-chair for the\u000aairing--and pay them all myself!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWho is it,\u201d said Dolff, coming forward out of the gloom, \u201cwho has to be\u000apaid back?
p17088
aVand who is this man?
p17089
aVFor you all seem to know.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCome, come, sir,\u201d said Vicars; \u201cit\u2019s your time for bed.
p17090
aVYou\u2019ll not go\u000anowhere, neither for an airing nor to pay them debts of yours, if you\u000adon\u2019t come straight off to bed.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWho is he?\u201d cried Dolff, pushing upon the group.
p17091
aV\u201cWho are you?
p17092
aVFor I\u000awill know.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo the surprise of all, the madman, who had been so self-confident,\u000asuddenly shrank behind Vicars, and, catching his arm, pulled him towards\u000athe door that led to the wing.
p17093
aV\u201cI\u2019m afraid of that man,\u201d he said, in a whispering, hissing tone.
p17094
aV\u201cVicars, get me home; get me out of sight.
p17095
aVHe\u2019s an officer.
p17096
aVVicars, I\u2019m\u000anot safe with that man!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHold your tongue, can\u2019t you, Mr. Dolff, till I get him away,\u201d cried\u000aVicars, pushing past.
p17097
aVAnd in a moment the pair had disappeared within\u000athe mysterious door, which swung after them, noiseless, closing without\u000aa sound.
p17098
aVDolff was left, pale and threatening, with Meredith and his two sisters\u000afacing him.
p17099
aVThat they should know what he did not filled Dolff with a\u000asort of frenzy; and yet how could he continue to say that he did not\u000aknow?
p17100
aV\u201cI wish,\u201d cried Julia, stamping her foot, \u201cthat you two who know such a\u000alot would go away, and not speak to Dolff and me.
p17101
aVYou don\u2019t belong to\u000aus--at least Charley Meredith doesn\u2019t belong to us, and Gussy thinks\u000amore of him than of all of us together.
p17102
aVOh, Dolff, it only matters to\u000ayou and me!
p17103
aVI believe,\u201d cried Julia, catching her brother\u2019s arm, \u201cthat\u000aold madman\u2019s our father, Dolff.
p17104
aVI believe he is our father.
p17105
aVIt\u2019s\u000aterrible, it\u2019s odious, and I will never forgive mamma.
p17106
aVWhy isn\u2019t he\u000adead?
p17107
aVas she said he was.
p17108
aVDolff--oh, don\u2019t mind it so dreadfully!
p17109
aVI\u000adon\u2019t mind it so dreadfully: he\u2019s only mad--and that\u2019s not wicked after\u000aall.\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff pushed past them all to where his mother sat in that temple of\u000abrightness and comfort, in her chair.
p17110
aVEverything that could be done for\u000aher convenience and consolation in her incapacity was about her.
p17111
aVShe sat\u000athere as in a sanctuary, the centre of the most peaceful house.
p17112
aVAnd\u000athere she had sat for years with the air of knowing nothing different,\u000afearing nothing, meeting every day that rose and every night that fell\u000awith the same serene composure--a woman with nothing to conceal, nothing\u000ato alarm her, occupied only with little cares of the family and\u000asympathies with others, and the knitting with which she was always busy.
p17113
aVTo look at her, and to think of the burden that had been for so long\u000aupon her shoulders, unknown, undreamed of, was a problem beyond the\u000areach of imagination.
p17114
aVNever a line upon her brow, and all that mystery\u000aand misery behind.
p17115
aVThe room, usually so orderly, was a little disarranged to-night, the\u000achairs pushed about anyhow, and one lying where it fell, which had been\u000apushed over as Vicars led his patient out.
p17116
aVAnd she had sat there\u000apatiently and listened to the voices in the hall, knowing that another\u000aencounter was taking place--knowing that her son was desperate, that he\u000ahad it in him to be violent, that it was enough to touch that secret\u000aspring of madness which, for aught she could tell, the son of a mad\u000afather might have inherited.
p17117
aVPerhaps, had she been scanned at that\u000amoment by any one more able to judge than Dolff, the signs of a conflict\u000amight have been seen in her eyes, but to Dolff she appeared precisely as\u000ashe always was in her incredible calm.
p17118
aVHe placed himself in front of her\u000awith the air of an angry man demanding an explanation from his inferior.
p17119
aV\u201cIs that man my father?\u201d he said.
p17120
aV\u201cDolff, this is not a way either to address me or to inquire about your\u000afather.
p17121
aVYes, it is your father whom you have just seen, afflicted almost\u000aall your lifetime, an object for pity and reverence, not for this angry\u000atone.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat had he done that you kept him shut up for fifteen years?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDone!\u201d Even Mrs. Harwood\u2019s steady tones faltered a little.
p17122
aV\u201cWhy should\u000ahe have done anything, Dolff?
p17123
aVHe was mad.
p17124
aVIf it had been known that I\u000ahad kept him here he would have been taken from me, and how could I\u000atell that he would have been kindly treated, or humored, or waited on as\u000ahe would be at home?
p17125
aVHe was never violent, and I knew Vicars could\u000amanage him.
p17126
aVIf you saw how carefully everything was arranged for him,\u000ayou would not think it was from want of affection--too much perhaps,\u201d\u000ashe added, putting her handkerchief to her eyes.
p17127
aV\u201cAnd what is the meaning, then, of this about paying, and the\u000apocket-book?\u201d asked Dolff, half convinced.
p17128
aVMrs. Harwood put her hands together with a little gesture of appeal.
p17129
aV\u201cHow can I explain the fancies of a mind that is astray?\u201d she said.
p17130
aV\u201cHe\u000ahas got something into his head, some distorted recollection of things\u000athat happened before.
p17131
aVHe was not quite fortunate in his business,\u201d she\u000aadded, with a slight trembling in her voice; \u201cthe worry about that was\u000asupposed to have something to do with his breakdown.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen there were, I suppose, people to pay--whom he thinks he has\u000aprovided for in that pocket book?\u201d\u000a\u000aHe thought she gave an alarmed glance at some one behind him, and,\u000aturning round, caught what seemed to him an answering glance in the eyes\u000aof Meredith.
p17132
aV\u201c_He_ knows,\u201d cried Dolff; \u201cyou take him into your confidence, but give\u000aonly what you can\u2019t help to me!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCharley is to appear for me before the commissioners,\u201d said Mrs.\u000aHarwood, with dignity; \u201cI have given him all the information which was\u000aready for you had you not treated your mother as if she were an enemy\u000atrying to injure you.
p17133
aVIf you do not know, it is your own fault.\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff did not know what to think: his courage failed before his mother.
p17134
aVPerhaps it was true that Meredith (though he hated him) had stood by the\u000amother more than he, Dolff, had done, and was of more use in this great\u000afamily emergency.
p17135
aVThis thought stung him, but he could not escape from\u000ait.
p17136
aVAnd to think that if she had but been frank and honest--if he had\u000aknown of it, as he ought to have done, as soon as he was old enough to\u000aunderstand----\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, mother,\u201d he cried, \u201cwhy did you keep it from us?
p17137
aVWhy did I not know\u000along ago?\u201d\u000a\u000aA slight quiver came over Mrs. Harwood\u2019s face.
p17138
aV\u201cWhat I did I did for the best.
p17139
aVOne may be mistaken, but I thought it\u000abest for you all,\u201d she said.
p17140
aV\u201cAnd I think Mrs. Harwood has had enough agitation for one night,\u201d said\u000aMeredith.
p17141
aV\u201cYou have nothing to do with it!\u201d said Dolff, wildly, \u201cyou--what have\u000ayou to do with our family?
p17142
aVWhat right have you with our secrets?--since\u000awe have secrets,\u201d the young man added, in a tone of despair.
p17143
aVAnd Meredith fixed his laughing eyes upon Dolff.
p17144
aVHe could laugh, however\u000aserious the circumstances might be.
p17145
aV\u201cThere are some secrets,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich are supposed to be quite safe\u000awith me--which it might be awkward for other people were I to let\u000aescape.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe looked Dolff full in the eyes, and his laugh drove the young man\u000aalmost to frenzy.
p17146
aVBut at the same time it recalled him to himself.
p17147
aVHe\u000adared not meet Meredith\u2019s laughing eyes.
p17148
aVAs long as they should both\u000alive this fellow would have him at a disadvantage.
p17149
aVDolff drew back with\u000aa mortification and humiliation which were unspeakable.
p17150
aVHe had no longer\u000athe courage to question his mother, to assert his own rights.
p17151
aVHe had the\u000aright to know everything, to be the first to be consulted in his own\u000ahouse.
p17152
aVBut that look was enough to silence him, to drive him back.
p17153
aVOh,\u000athat he should have put such power into another\u2019s hand!
p17154
aVAnd for what?
p17155
aVFor whom?
p17156
aV\u201cIf it will be any satisfaction to you, Dolff,\u201d said Gussy, \u201cI knew all\u000athe time--at least, I have known for a year or two.
p17157
aVMamma told me, just\u000aas she has told you, that he was--afflicted soon after Ju was born, and\u000athat she knew they would not let her keep him if it was known.
p17158
aVSo it was\u000asaid he had died abroad, where he was for a little while.
p17159
aVIs that so,\u000amamma?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are quite right, my dear,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, who had quite\u000arecovered her composure.
p17160
aV\u201cBut with this in addition: that the news came\u000aof his death, and that I had got my widow\u2019s mourning and everything was\u000asettled, when I found out that we had been mistaken.
p17161
aVVicars had gone\u000awith him, and Vicars brought him back.
p17162
aVHe sent me a letter to say that\u000ayour father was not dead, but afflicted, and that he was bringing him\u000aback.
p17163
aVI could not tell what to do.
p17164
aVI did not want to let anybody know.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy?\u201d said Dolff, who had plucked up a little courage.
p17165
aVThis time Gussy\u000aand Julia both stood by him.
p17166
aVThey looked at their mother, the three\u000afaces together, all so much alike, lit up with the same sentiment.
p17167
aV\u201cWhy\u000adid you make a mystery of it?\u201d said Dolff.
p17168
aV\u201cWould it not have been\u000aeasier if everything had been frank and above-board?\u201d\u000a\u000aFor a moment there was silence in the room.
p17169
aVMrs. Harwood made no reply.
p17170
aVFor the first time in all these fifteen years she wavered, her\u000aconfidence forsook her, she had all but broken down.
p17171
aVAnother moment and\u000athe silence itself would have betrayed that there was something\u000aelse--another secret still unrevealed.
p17172
aVAs she looked at them all\u000atogether, her three children all asking the same question with faces\u000aovershadowed by a cloud of doubt, her strong heart almost gave way.
p17173
aV\u201cMrs.
p17174
aVHarwood has already told you the reason,\u201d said Meredith behind\u000athem.
p17175
aV\u201cShe knew that she would not be allowed to keep him, that he would\u000abe carried off from her to an asylum----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, children,\u201d cried Mrs. Harwood, with a burst of sobbing which was\u000ahalf relief, \u201cit is hard, hard upon me to drive me back again to that\u000atime!
p17176
aVI had to take my resolution all at once.
p17177
aVI had nobody to advise\u000ame.
p17178
aVI came up here, and took this house, and prepared it all myself.
p17179
aVYou\u000amay see for yourselves how carefully it is done.
p17180
aVI made the curtains and\u000athings with my own hands.
p17181
aVOh, I did not spare any trouble to make him\u000acomfortable!
p17182
aVAnd we managed everything, Vicars and I.
p17183
aVAt first, even,\u000awhen he was not so weak, we managed to get him out sometimes to take the\u000aair.
p17184
aVWe did everything for him.
p17185
aVI was not laid up then.
p17186
aVWhy should I\u000adefend myself before you as if you were my judges?\u201d she cried, drying\u000aher eyes hastily.
p17187
aV\u201cIt was all for you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMamma,\u201d said Julia, \u201cyou said just now it was because you would not be\u000aallowed to keep him--because he would be taken from you and put into an\u000aasylum: and now you say it was for us----\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Harwood again raised her head and gave them a look; her countenance\u000achanged, a flash of anger came over her face.
p17188
aVShe had borne everything\u000aelse, but these exasperating questions were more than she could bear.
p17189
aVShe was about to answer with unusual passion when Meredith\u2019s voice came\u000ain again.
p17190
aV\u201cYou do not remember,\u201d he said, \u201cthat to have a father in a lunatic\u000aasylum is not the best thing in the world for a family.
p17191
aVMrs. Harwood\u000adesired to save you that, to save you the anxiety of knowing he was\u000ahere, to bear everything herself and leave your minds free.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCharley,\u201d cried Gussy, quickly, \u201cthank you, you understand her better\u000athan we have done.
p17192
aVOh, mamma, that was why you told me so little--even\u000ame.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI did it for your sakes,\u201d said the mother, yielding at last to an\u000aexasperation beyond her power of resistance, and bursting into\u000auncontrolled tears.
p17193
aVCHAPTER XLIX.
p17194
aVThe explanation was over, but the family atmosphere was not cleared.
p17195
aVGussy indeed had been moved out of her resentment and doubt, partly for\u000athe sake of her lover, partly for the sake of her mother.
p17196
aVTo stand out\u000aagainst both was more than she had been capable of.
p17197
aVAnd Meredith had\u000abeen perhaps alarmed by her sudden withdrawal from him, or in some other\u000away (she could not tell how) moved back towards his former devotion.
p17198
aVHe\u000awas more anxious to draw her back, to recover her attention, than he had\u000aever been before in any of the little brief estrangements which Gussy\u000awas generally the person to bring to an end.
p17199
aVBut on this occasion it was\u000aentirely he who did it, who sought her pardon, her return of tenderness,\u000aall the old attentions that had once been lavished upon him.
p17200
aVGussy could\u000anot resist that silent moving back of her heart; and it pleased her that\u000ahe should defend her mother, whether or not her mother was worthy of it.
p17201
aVBut the younger ones were not moved by this influence.
p17202
aVThey were the\u000amore dissatisfied with their mother\u2019s defence, because Meredith had\u000achimed in, to put arguments into her mouth when she was about, as they\u000abelieved, to break down.
p17203
aVHad she been permitted to break down, a more\u000afull explanation might have been had, and the children might then have\u000aforgiven their mother; but, as it was, there had been too much and not\u000aenough.
p17204
aVAn insufficient explanation is the most painful of family\u000amisfortunes.
p17205
aVIt gives a sense of falsehood and insincerity to the mind.
p17206
aVWhen you do not explain at all, it is possible you may be innocent: but\u000awhen you explain profusely, dwelling upon some sides of the matter while\u000aignoring others, you must be guilty: and the impression left is all the\u000amore unhappy and unsatisfactory that it is in its way definitive and\u000afinal, and all are precluded from opening up the subject again.
p17207
aVUnless\u000asome new incident took place, or some accident which disturbed the\u000afamily laws, Dolff could not ask any more questions.
p17208
aVHe was too young to\u000aknow what to do, too proud and shame-faced to hazard the credit of the\u000afamily by making inquiries in other quarters.
p17209
aVAn uneasy sense that\u000aeverything was different, that his own position and that of everybody\u000aelse was changed, that he was no longer sure of the ground on which he\u000astood, or the relations of those around him, was in Dolff\u2019s mind.
p17210
aVIt\u000amust make a difference that his father was alive, even though that\u000afather was a madman: and vague notions came into his painfully exercised\u000abrain--ideas half seen, uncomprehended, of some sense in which his\u000amother might have done what she had done for their sakes, although she\u000ahad professed in the same breath that it was for her husband\u2019s sake she\u000ahad done it, that he might not be shut up away from her.
p17211
aVJulia, on the\u000aother hand who was much more sharp-witted than Dolff, had seized like\u000alightning upon this inconsistency, and could not forget it.
p17212
aV\u201cShe said it was for him and then she said it was for us,\u201d cried the\u000agirl.
p17213
aV\u201cHow could it be for us when it was for him?
p17214
aVIt could not be\u000asupposed good for us that there should have been some one shut up there\u000ain the wing, and when we might have found it out any day.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI never found it out nor thought of it,\u201d said Dolff.
p17215
aV\u201cIf I had been\u000atold of it I should not have believed it.
p17216
aVI should have said my mother\u000awas the last person in the world for mysteries--the very last person in\u000athe world--and that everything in this house was honest and\u000aabove-board.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI never thought like that,\u201d said Julia, shaking her head.
p17217
aV\u201cThere was\u000aalways something queer.
p17218
aVVicars, that was our servant, and yet not our\u000aservant, and that cry that one heard----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat cry?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, an awful cry that we heard sometimes.
p17219
aVJanet heard it when she had\u000aonly been here a week, and she was dreadfully frightened.
p17220
aVSo was I at\u000afirst,\u201d said Julia, with dignity.
p17221
aV\u201cIt has only been for a few years:\u000amamma explained it to me: she said it was the wind in the vacant\u000achimneys that were not used.
p17222
aVOh, Dolff, though she knew very well it was\u000anot the wind, and the chimneys were not vacant!
p17223
aVDolff, mamma has said a\u000agreat many things that are----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t talk of the mother, Ju--I\u2019m very fond of the mother; and to think\u000ashe should ever---- Don\u2019t--I think perhaps there might be reasons for\u000aour sakes, as she said.
p17224
aVThe property, you know, came from my grandfather\u000ato us.
p17225
aVIf he were known to have been alive, perhaps--I don\u2019t know so\u000amuch about business as I ought--perhaps---- It makes my head a little\u000aqueer to think of all that.
p17226
aVShe might have reasons.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf it was simply for _him_, as she said first, to keep him from being\u000asent to an asylum, it could not be for us as well.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m not so sure of that,\u201d said Dolff stroking fondly, but with a very\u000aserious face, his youthful very light moustache, light both in color and\u000atexture.
p17227
aV\u201cI have noticed in ladies,\u201d said quick-witted Julia, \u201cthat they like to\u000ahave a motive, don\u2019t you know--something nice, as if they were always\u000athinking of others, never of themselves; when they do anything, it\u2019s\u000aalways for their children.
p17228
aVMamma is not like that, to do her justice;\u000awhen things are going on she says she likes it, not for us only.
p17229
aVOh,\u000aDolff!
p17230
aVto think of the parties and romps we have had this Christmas, and\u000apeople coming to dinner, and _him_ there all the while!\u201d\u000a\u000aThey were both overawed by the thought, and silenced, not venturing even\u000ato look at one another, when Julia suddenly cried out,\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a party to-morrow, Dolff.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt mustn\u2019t be,\u201d said the young man; \u201cthey must write and say it can\u2019t\u000abe.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat can they say?
p17231
aVNobody is ill; you can\u2019t shut the people out who\u000acome to call, and they would see mamma was quite well, and know it was\u000anot true.
p17232
aVOh, no; mamma will say we must keep up appearances; and she\u000awill be there, looking as nice as possible at the end of the table, and\u000aVicars behind her chair.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJu, what did they do with _him_ when Vicars was at all the parties\u000abehind her chair?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe was fastened in, I suppose, the doors all locked.
p17233

aVDolff, suppose he had come downstairs one of these times, as he did last\u000anight!\u201d\u000a\u000aThey looked at each other with a shudder.
p17235
aV\u201cPerhaps on the whole,\u201d said the young man, \u201cit _was_ better for us that\u000awe did not know.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis was how they came to a partial approval of their mother.
p17236
aVIt rankled\u000ain their hearts that she had said to them what was not true, that she\u000ahad made explanations which they could not refuse yet could not receive;\u000athat this tremendous crisis had come and gone in their lives and\u000aeverything been changed, and yet that they were little wiser than\u000abefore.
p17237
aVAnd it was still more bitter for Dolff to perceive, what he\u000acould not help seeing whenever the family assembled together, that the\u000aknowledge that was kept from him was given to Meredith: but yet it had\u000agleamed upon him that after all there might be something reasonable in\u000ahis mother\u2019s plea.
p17238
aVThere came, however, in this way to be two parties in the house--one\u000awhich knew and discussed everything, the other which knew nothing and\u000aimagined a great deal, and chafed at the ignorance in which it was kept,\u000ayet found no means of knowing more or understanding better.

aVMrs. Harwood\u000atalked apart with Gussy and Meredith, who were always about her chair.
p17240
aVWhen the others came into the room there was a momentary silence, and\u000athen one of the three would start an indifferent subject.
p17241
aVIt was enough\u000afor Dolff or Julia to come near to stop all conversation of any\u000aimportance.
p17242
aVThey were shut out from all that was serious in the house as\u000aif they had nothing to do with it, as if their lives were not bound up\u000awith it as much--nay, far more than the others!
p17243
aVWhat had Meredith to do\u000awith it, at all?
p17244
aVOnly through Gussy, who, if she married him at last,\u000awould go away with him and be a Harwood no longer; whereas Dolff,\u000awhatever happened, would always be the representative of the family,\u000athough shut out from its councils and kept in ignorance of its affairs.
p17245
aVMrs. Harwood had decided, as Julia foresaw, that the party was to take\u000aplace, that the world was not to be permitted to see any difference.
p17246
aVSuch whispers as had crept out could be silenced in no other way.
p17247
aV\u201cOf course they have heard something,\u201d she said, \u201cand if they were put\u000aoff, if we made any excuse, they would believe the most of what they\u000aheard, whatever it was; but if they are received the same as ever and\u000ahave as good a dinner, and see us all just as usual, even the\u000aworst-thinking people will be confused.
p17248
aVThey will not believe we could\u000abe such hypocrites as that.
p17249
aVThey will say whatever it is that has\u000ahappened must be much exaggerated.
p17250
aVThe Harwoods look just as usual.
p17251
aVOh,\u000aI know the world a little,\u201d she said, with a half laugh.
p17252
aVEven Gussy, who knew her so well, was bewildered by her mother\u2019s\u000afortitude, and by the clearness of her vision.
p17253
aV\u201cI know the world a little,\u201d Mrs. Harwood said.
p17254
aV\u201cI have lived in it a\u000agreat many years.
p17255
aVNothing makes quite such an impression as we expect.
p17256
aVThe people who can piece things together and understand exactly what has\u000ahappened, are the ones that don\u2019t hear of it, and those who do hear\u000ahaven\u2019t got the clue.
p17257
aVI have told Charley already what I think.
p17258
aVIf we\u000astand together and are bold, we\u2019ll get out of it all, and no great harm\u000awill come.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, you have told me, and I begin to believe,\u201d said Meredith.
p17259
aV\u201cWhat do you mean by harm coming?\u201d said Gussy, surprised.
p17260
aV\u201cGossip about\u000aone\u2019s family is not pleasant; but that is all, and what other harm could\u000acome?\u201d\u000a\u000aHer mother and her lover looked at each other, and a faint sign passed\u000abetween them; they did not venture to smile, much less to laugh, at the\u000asimplicity which understood nothing.
p17261
aVDolff, too, overheard this talk\u000awith an ache of wonder.
p17262
aVWhat did they mean?
p17263
aVSomething more than gossip,\u000ahe felt sure; for what did it matter about gossip?
p17264
aVThe madman in the\u000ahouse would scare and startle the neighbors, but it was not that his\u000amother meant.
p17265
aVWhat did she mean?
p17266
aVHe was the one that was likely to\u000abetray himself at the dinner-party, where he was compelled to take the\u000afoot of the table as usual, much against his will.
p17267
aV\u201cWhy can\u2019t you put Meredith there?\u201d he said; \u201cyou trust him a great deal\u000amore than you trust me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd if I do so,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, \u201chave I not good reason?
p17268
aVHe is not\u000aalways flinging my mistake--if it is a mistake--in my face.
p17269
aVHe is\u000awilling to do what he can for me.
p17270
aVTo help me without setting up for a\u000ajudge.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have not set up for a judge,\u201d said Dolff.
p17271
aV\u201cYou have,\u201d his mother said; \u201cyou are judging me and finding me wanting\u000awhatever I do.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy should you have this party?\u201d cried the young man; \u201cwhy fill the\u000ahouse with strangers when we are all so miserable?\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff could have cried with trouble and discontent and a sense of wrong\u000ahad not his manhood forbidden such an indulgence.
p17272
aVHe was all wrong, out\u000aof place, wherever he turned.
p17273
aV\u201cI see no cause you have to be miserable.
p17274
aVI am not miserable,\u201d said Mrs.\u000aHarwood, \u201cand I hope you will have the sense not to look so, making\u000aeverybody talk.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis effort, however, on the part of Dolff was impossible.
p17275
aVHe sat at the\u000afoot of the table like a ghost.
p17276
aVHe scarcely opened his mouth, either to\u000athe lady on his right hand or the lady on his left.
p17277
aVHe ate nothing,\u000amaking it very evident that he had something on his mind; and it became\u000aquite clear to all the guests that Dolff was in great trouble.
p17278
aVRumors\u000aabout him had flown through the neighborhood, as well as rumors on the\u000aother subject, perplexed stories of which it was difficult to make\u000aanything.
p17279
aVBut when his mother\u2019s guests saw Dolff\u2019s looks, they were\u000ainstantly convinced that the true part of the story was that which\u000aconcerned him.
p17280
aV\u201cDidn\u2019t you remark what a hang-dog look he had?
p17281
aVDepend upon it, it is\u000aDolff that is at the bottom of everything.
p17282
aVThe other thing is probably\u000agreat nonsense, but Dolff is evidently in a bad way.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis was the conclusion arrived at by Mrs. Harwood\u2019s guests, which that\u000ainscrutable woman had foreseen, and for which, perhaps, she was scarcely\u000asorry.
p17283
aVIt is so common for a young man to get into a scrape--and when\u000athe said young man is only two-and-twenty it is not so difficult to get\u000ahim out of it.
p17284
aVEven the hardest of judges are tolerant of\u000amisdemeanors--when they are not dishonorable--at that age.
p17285
aVTherefore,\u000aperhaps, the mother calculated--being forced to very deep calculations\u000aat this trying period--that it would do no harm to the house to have the\u000atrouble in it saddled upon Dolff.
p17286
aV\u201cIs that all?\u201d people would say.
p17287
aVWhereas to have a family secret divulged--to have curious minds in St.\u000aJohn\u2019s Wood inquiring what was the meaning of that story about a secret\u000ainmate in the Harwoods\u2019 house, and who the Harwoods were before they\u000acame to that house, and what there was in the antecedents of the family\u000ato account for it--that would be a very different matter.
p17288
aVWhen a\u000asympathetic friend, anxious to find out what she could, condoled with\u000aher after dinner in the drawing-room about her son\u2019s looks, Mrs. Harwood\u000aaccepted the kind expressions gratefully.
p17289
aV\u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cI am afraid Dolff is not looking very well, poor boy;\u000ahe has had a good deal to trouble him: but I hope everything is now in a\u000aright way, and he will have no more bother.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWas it some trouble with his college?\u201d asked the sympathetic friend.
p17290
aV\u201cOh, no!
p17291
aVnothing with the college,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood.
p17292
aV\u201cHe has stayed\u000adown for an extra week to look after some business, and he is going back\u000ato Oxford in a day or two--it is nothing of that kind.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe friend concluded from this that it was debt which was troubling\u000aDolff, \u201clike all the young men.\u201d And his mother, no doubt, had been\u000aobliged to draw her purse.
p17293
aVIt must have been some writ or something of\u000athat sort--which is a thing that still always seems to involve dungeons\u000aand horrors to women--which had taken the \u201cpolice\u201d to the Harwoods: for\u000athat the \u201cpolice\u201d had been at the house of the Harwoods everybody knew.
p17294
aVPoor Dolff!
p17295
aVbut he had evidently got a lesson, and probably it would do\u000agood for him in the end, these good people thought.
p17296
aVThus Mrs. Harwood\u2019s plan was successful more than she could have hoped,\u000aand it seemed as if all would settle down again, and go well.
p17297
aVMeredith\u000ahad arranged everything for his appearance before the commissioners on\u000aher behalf.
p17298
aVHe had a very touching story to tell.
p17299
aVThe poor wife\u000adistracted by the arrival of her husband, whom she had supposed to be\u000adead, but who was brought back to her when she was in her widow\u2019s weeds,\u000anot dead, indeed, but mad, and as much severed from life and all its\u000aways as if he had been dead indeed; and how she had no one to advise\u000aher, no one to consult with, and had come to a rash but heroic\u000aresolution to devote herself to him, to provide for his comfort secretly\u000ain her own house; and how he had been carefully tended by an\u000aexperienced servant, and by herself until rheumatism crippled her and\u000aconfined her to her chair--which still did not prevent her now and then\u000afrom paying him visits, at the cost of great agony to herself, to see\u000athat all was well.
p17300
aV\u201cSuch things rarely get into the papers unless there is some special\u000ainterest in them,\u201d said Meredith.
p17301
aV\u201cI think with a little care we may\u000akeep it quiet, and then----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen all will be safe,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, \u201cand no secrecy whatever.
p17302
aVOh!
p17303
aVmy dear Charley, what I shall owe you!--the relief to my mind, above\u000aall.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou will owe me no more than you will pay me,\u201d he said, with a laugh;\u000a\u201cwhich will satisfy _him_ also, as clearing off those debts which are so\u000amuch on his mind.
p17304
aVIt is a transaction by which we shall all gain.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis was not a point of view which was agreeable to Mrs. Harwood.
p17305
aV\u201cI wish,\u201d she said, \u201cthat you would not treat it in that way.
p17306
aVIt will be\u000aGussy\u2019s fortune.
p17307
aVI have a right to give Gussy what I please.
p17308
aVShe has not\u000asaid anything to me, but I hope you have spoken to Gussy----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs soon as the business is over,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen I shall have won--not\u000aonly Gussy, but my share----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh!
p17309
aVfor heaven\u2019s sake,\u201d cried Mrs. Harwood, \u201cdo not speak of it like\u000athat.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER L.\u000a\u000a\u000aMeantime Janet, who had nothing to do with dinner-parties or anything of\u000athe kind, and who in the agitated state of the house appeared but\u000alittle, and did not linger a moment longer than could be helped\u000adownstairs, had been passing through a period of suspense which was\u000aintolerable to her--far more terrible to bear than all the burdens,\u000ainvolving so much, which were on the accustomed shoulders of Mrs.\u000aHarwood.
p17310
aVIt was on Tuesday that she had written that momentous\u000aletter--that appeal of her impatient young soul to fate.
p17311
aVShe had written\u000abegging that she might be delivered at once from the position which she\u000acould not bear.
p17312
aV\u201cAll that I was threatened with before I left Clover has come true,\u201d she\u000asaid, \u201cthough not in the way they thought: and I can\u2019t bear it any\u000alonger; and, if you meant what you said, come--come and take me away at\u000aonce.
p17313
aVIf you don\u2019t come I will know that you didn\u2019t mean it, or that\u000ayou have changed your mind: and I will do what I can for myself.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday!
p17314
aVThursday at the latest should have brought a letter--though\u000awhat she had expected was, that on Wednesday, the very day he received\u000ahers, he would come at once, answering it in person.
p17315
aVThis was the\u000anatural thing to expect.
p17316
aVHe would come--full of that ardor which had\u000amade Janet laugh when in October he had pleaded with her not to go away,\u000ato let him take care of her, provide for her.
p17317
aVIt had seemed to Janet the\u000amost ridiculous of suggestions that she should give her hand to the old\u000adoctor, and settle down for life in the familiar place where she knew\u000aeverybody and everything, and where novelty was not, nor change of any\u000akind.
p17318
aVAnd it was only January, the end of January, not much more than three\u000amonths!
p17319
aVwas it possible that life had so disgusted this little neophyte,\u000awho had faced it so valiantly, that she gave up the battle already?
p17320
aVShe\u000ahad asked herself that question as soon as her letter was in the\u000apost-office and beyond her control.
p17321
aVWhat was there to hinder her from\u000agoing on to another chapter, from spurning from her this prelude in\u000awhich she had not come off a conqueror--three months only, and to throw\u000adown her arms!
p17322
aVThe moment that Janet had dropped her letter into the box at Mimpriss\u2019s\u000athat place which had played so large a part in her life, her heart made\u000aa great leap, a sort of sickening rebound against what she had done.
p17323
aVOh\u000ano; her first beginning had not been a success.
p17324
aVShe had betrayed people\u000awho had been so good to her; her quick wit had seen too much, known too\u000amuch, in the house where she ought to have been a grateful spectator\u000aonly, making no discoveries.
p17325
aVShe had not been unwilling, by way of mere\u000afun and distraction, to take Gussy\u2019s lover from her.
p17326
aVShe had not been\u000aunwilling \u201cto make a fool of\u201d the son of the house.
p17327
aVShe had been there\u000alike a little free lance to get what amusement and advantage she could\u000aout of them, without giving anything in return.
p17328
aVBut Janet, though she had succeeded in the most remarkable way in both\u000acases, had come to such a failure in the end as made her loathe herself.
p17329
aVShe had been met by her match, she had been deluded by a stronger\u000apractitioner of those arts, intent upon fun and distraction too, and\u000awith as little intention of promoting Janet as of anything else that\u000awould involve trouble to himself.
p17330
aVHow could she ever have thought it?
p17331
aVA\u000aman who betrayed the woman who loved him to her, a stranger, how could\u000ashe have supposed that he would be true to her and give up his own\u000ainterest to proclaim his devotion to the governess!
p17332
aVAnd Dolff, the dolt\u000awhom she had said to herself that she could turn round her little\u000afinger--Dolff, who had nearly killed the other man who had played with\u000aher; but not even that for Janet\u2019s sake.
p17333
aVFor his sister\u2019s sake, whom\u000aJanet had never taken into consideration--Dolff, too, had thrown her off\u000aas easily as an old glove when he got into trouble, and more serious\u000amatters occupied his mind.
p17334
aVThese extraordinary failures had altogether overset Janet\u2019s moral\u000aequilibrium.
p17335
aVHad she been driven out of the house by the jealousy of the\u000awomen, with the secret sympathy and support of the men, a victim to the\u000aspitefulness of her own sex, but assured in her power of attracting and\u000asubjugating the other, Janet would have felt this to be quite natural--a\u000athing that is in all the stories, the natural fate of the too attractive\u000adependent.
p17336
aVBut this was not at all her case.
p17337
aVThe ladies had been very\u000akind to her; they had never discovered her misdoings.
p17338
aVEven Gussy, if she\u000asuspected anything, had taken no notice, which was to Janet very\u000ahumiliating, an immense mortification, though the thing most to be\u000adesired by anyone who had retained a morsel of sense.
p17339
aVJanet had a great deal of sense, but in this emergency it forsook\u000aher--the kindness of the ladies had added a sting to the humiliating\u000ainsincerity of Meredith and the indignant self-emancipation of Dolff.
p17340
aVShe had failed every way.
p17341
aVIt was she who was jealous--the one to be\u000athrown aside; the legitimate sentiment had triumphed all along the line,\u000aand the little interloper had failed in everything.
p17342
aVShe had thought that\u000ato prove to them at last that she had no need of them, that she had but\u000ato hold up a finger to bring her deliverer flying to the rescue, to be\u000acarried off triumphant to her own house, to her own people, would be a\u000atriumph which would make up for all, while still Meredith was in the\u000ahouse, while Dolff was at home, while everyone could see how little\u000anecessity she had to care what they thought!
p17343
aVJanet knew, she was\u000acertain, that the moment she held up a finger---- And she had held it\u000aup--she had summoned her deliverer--without pausing to think.
p17344
aVBut when she dropped the letter in the letter-box at the window of\u000aMimpriss\u2019s there suddenly came over Janet a vision of Dr. Harding as she\u000ahad seen him last, rusty, splashed with mud, his hat pushed back on a\u000aforehead that was a little bald, his coat-collar rubbed with hair that\u000awas iron-gray.
p17345
aVHe was nearly as old as Meredith and Dolff added up\u000atogether; a country doctor, called out day and night by whoever pleased\u000ato send for him, not even rich.
p17346
aVOh, the agitated night Janet had after\u000athat rash step of hers!
p17347
aVShe had called him to her, and he would come\u000aflying on wings of love--_i.
p17348
aVe._, by the quickest express train that\u000anever stopped between Clover and London, which flew even past the\u000ajunction--that terrible train which frightened all the Clover ladies; as\u000aquick as the telegraph almost would he be here.
p17349
aVJanet held her breath and asked herself how she could have done it?
p17350
aVAnd\u000awhat if, when he came, holding out his arms to her as he would be sure\u000ato do, her heart should fail and she should turn away--turn her back on\u000ahim after she had summoned him?
p17351
aVOh, that was what she must not, dare not\u000ado.
p17352
aVShe had settled her fate; she had committed herself beyond remedy.
p17353
aVIf Meredith and Dolff should repent, and fling themselves one after\u000aanother at her feet, it would do no good now.
p17354
aVHe might be ready to\u000asacrifice Gussy to her, but she could not sacrifice Dr. Harding to him.
p17355
aVOh, not now--she had settled her fate now!
p17356
aVAll Wednesday morning Janet was in a state of suspense which defies\u000adescription.
p17357
aVShe expected every moment to be called downstairs, to be\u000atold that a gentleman had come asking for her.
p17358
aVThe train arrived at\u000ahalf-past ten, just half-an-hour after the hour at which she sat down\u000awith Julia to lessons.
p17359
aVLessons, good heavens!
p17360
aVThey had never, perhaps,\u000abeen very excellent of their kind, these lessons, though they had been\u000agone through with steadily enough; but Julia had been quite well aware\u000afrom the first that Janet\u2019s heart was not in them, just as Janet had\u000adiscovered from the first that Julia would learn no more than she could\u000apossibly help learning.
p17361
aVAnd it may be supposed that, with this\u000aindifferent mutual foundation, the agitated state of the house, and of\u000athe minds of both instructress and instructed, had not improved the\u000aseriousness of the studies.
p17362
aVJanet calculated that half-an-hour would be\u000awanted to get from the station to St. John\u2019s Wood; half-an-hour would be\u000aenough, for of course he would take a hansom, the quickest to be had,\u000ainstead of the slow four-wheeler which had conveyed her and her luggage\u000aon the occasion of her arrival.
p17363
aVThen at eleven o\u2019clock!
p17364
aVOh, what should\u000ashe do, what could she do?
p17365
aVThere were but two things she could do--run\u000adownstairs at the first summons, and rush into Dr. Harding\u2019s arms--or\u000afly away, somewhere, she knew not where, before he came.
p17366
aVSitting dazed by this suspense, her heart beating in her ears, taking no\u000anotice of Julia\u2019s proceedings, which were very erratic, listening for\u000athe sound of Priscilla\u2019s steps on the stair with the summons feared yet\u000adesired, Janet came to herself with a shock at the sound of twelve,\u000astruck upon the little French clock on the mantelpiece, and by the\u000alarger church clock in St. John\u2019s Wood, at a minute\u2019s interval.
p17367
aVTwelve\u000ao\u2019clock!
p17368
aVIt must be eleven, it could not be twelve!
p17369
aVIt was impossible,\u000aimpossible!
p17370
aVBut, like so many other impossible things, it was true.
p17371
aVHer\u000aheart seemed to sink down into her slippers, and a horrible stillness\u000atook the place of all that beating.
p17372
aVHe had not come!
p17373
aVCould such a thing\u000abe?
p17374
aVHe had not come!
p17375
aVThen he had not meant it, or he meant it no longer.
p17376
aVDr. Harding, who had been her slave since she was a child, who had\u000apleaded, oh!
p17377
aVhow he had looked at her, what tones his voice had taken,\u000ahow he had implored her as if his life depended upon it!
p17378
aVwhile she--had\u000alaughed.
p17379
aVHer voice had trembled, too, but it was with laughter.
p17380
aVShe had\u000anot given a moment\u2019s consideration to that proposal.
p17381
aVShe, before whom\u000athe world lay open, full of triumphs, she marry the old doctor!
p17382
aVIt was\u000aludicrous, too absurd to be thought of; she had not been unkind, but she\u000ahad let him know this very completely; there had been no hesitation, no\u000arelenting in her reply.
p17383
aVAnd now he had done the same to her.
p17384
aVBut Janet could not believe it--she went on expecting him all day.
p17385
aVSomething might have happened to detain him in the morning.
p17386
aVHe might\u000ahave gone out upon his rounds before the letter came--sometimes the\u000apostman was very late, at Clover.
p17387
aVShe knew the life there so well that\u000ashe could calculate exactly when the letters would reach the doctor\u2019s\u000ahouse.
p17388
aVThe bag was always heavy in the beginning of the year.
p17389
aVClover was\u000aone of those places where all the people hear from their friends in the\u000aearly part of the year.
p17390
aVPerhaps there were still some belated Christmas\u000acards or premature valentines to give the postman more to do.
p17391
aVAnd some\u000aone might have been ill, and the doctor called out before his usual\u000atime.
p17392
aVAll these things were possible--but not that he should have\u000areceived her letter and not come.
p17393
aVBut when Thursday passed without even\u000aa letter in reply, and Friday--Friday, the third day!--Janet fell into a\u000astate of depression that was miserable to see.
p17394
aVShe could think of\u000anothing else.
p17395
aVHer doubts about the doctor\u2019s age, about his appearance,\u000aabout his gray hair, and all his disadvantages, disappeared altogether\u000afrom her mind.
p17396
aVAstonishment, humiliation, the sense of having fallen altogether from\u000aher high estate, of being a miserable little failure abandoned by\u000aeverybody, filled Janet\u2019s mind.
p17397
aVHe had not come, though she had sent for\u000ahim; he had turned a deaf ear to her appeal.
p17398
aVWhere could she now go?
p17399
aVNever to Clover to give him the chance of exulting over her, though\u000aClover was the only place in which she could find a home.
p17400
aVOh, how\u000afoolish, how foolish she had been!
p17401
aVShe might have gone back to the\u000avicarage with no more ado than saying that she was not happy in her\u000asituation.
p17402
aVThe vicar and his wife had expected as much--they would not\u000ahave been surprised.
p17403
aVBut now she had closed in her own face that\u000afriendly refuge.
p17404
aVShe had longed for a triumph, though it would be a\u000ahomely one, and again she had failed--again she had failed!
p17405
aVAnything\u000amore subdued, more troubled than Janet could not be.
p17406
aVThe doctor was no\u000alonger in her eyes a makeshift, an expedient--something to restore her\u000a_amour propre_, but whom she shrank from even in appealing to him.
p17407
aVShe\u000aforgot his rusty gray hair, his bald forehead, the mud on his boots.
p17408
aVOh,\u000aif he would but still come, if he would come!
p17409
aVTo let them see that she\u000ahad someone who cared for her, a man who thought her the first of women\u000awhile to them she was only the little governess.
p17410
aVBut when Friday came,\u000aJanet gave up the hope.
p17411
aVHe too had decided against her.
p17412
aVShe was not the\u000afirst of women to anybody, but a poor little foolish girl who would not\u000awhen she might and now had to be said nay.
p17413
aVThe lessons went on all the time, not, I fear, very profitable lessons,\u000aand the two girls went out to have their walks as usual, with what\u000acomfort they might, and everything continued like a feverish dream.
p17414
aVJanet sat upstairs and heard the sounds and commotion of the\u000adinner-party and did not care.
p17415
aVWhat did it matter that they were\u000afeasting below, while she was left all alone, neglected by everybody?
p17416
aVBy\u000aeverybody, yes!
p17417
aVeven by people who had loved her: nobody loved her now.
p17418
aVShe was forgotten, both by those at home and those here.
p17419
aVAnd what did it\u000amatter?
p17420
aVThe school-room, that was the place for a governess.
p17421
aVThey ought\u000anever to have brought her out of it.
p17422
aVIt was true she ought not to have\u000abeen deceived by any other thoughts--and it was true that she must\u000acalculate on spending all the rest of her life, nobody to give her any\u000atriumph, nobody to carry her away like a conqueror, nobody to vindicate\u000aher importance so that the Harwoods would see their mistake, and Mr.\u000aMeredith bite his lips with envy and dismay.
p17423
aVNo, that had all been a\u000adream; there was nobody to deliver Janet, and nothing for her but to\u000atake a new situation, and perhaps go through the whole again, as poor\u000agovernesses so often do.
p17424
aVOn Friday afternoon she had come in from her walk depressed beyond\u000adescription, feeling that everything had failed her.
p17425
aVJulia had gone into\u000athe drawing-room to her mother, while Janet, dragging a little behind,\u000aas she had begun to do in the prostration of her being, lingered in the\u000ahall, loitering by the umbrellas in the stand, untwining her boa from\u000aher throat, the boa which Meredith had held, by which he had detained\u000aher until she had thrown it upon his hands and escaped from him on their\u000alast interview.
p17426
aVShe was very low; expectation was dead in her--she no\u000alonger looked for an answer to her letter, nor for anything that could\u000ahappen.
p17427
aVSo dull, indeed, was she in her despondency that she did not\u000aheed the ring at the bell, nor the hasty step upon the path when\u000aPriscilla opened the door.
p17428
aVIt would be some visitor, some one for the\u000aothers--nobody any more for Janet.
p17429
aVIt was a noisy step which came in at\u000athe door, firm, a little heavy, and very hurried and rapid.
p17430
aVIt was almost twilight; the hall was dark, and Janet in the darkest\u000acorner, with her back to the door, slowly untwisting the boa from her\u000aneck, when--oh, what was this that burst upon her ear?
p17431
aV\u201cNo,\u201d very hastily, with an impatient tone, \u201cnot Mrs. Harwood.
p17432
aVI said\u000a\u2018Miss Summerhayes.\u2019 I want to see Miss Summerhayes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh!\u201d Janet turned round and came forward, feeling as if she had wings,\u000aas if her feet touched the ground no longer.
p17433
aVShe called out of the\u000adarkness, \u201cIs it you, is it you?\u201d as if she did not know who it was at\u000athe first thrill of his voice!
p17434
aV\u201cJanet,\u201d he cried, and came forward and caught her--not exactly in his\u000aarms, but with his hands upon her shoulders, clutching her with a sort\u000aof hungry grasp (\u201cas if he were going to eat me up,\u201d she said\u000aafterwards).
p17435
aVShe felt him trembling, thrilling all over, and perhaps it\u000awas as well that it was dark, that she could see nothing of the gray\u000ahair, etc., but only that the middle-aged doctor had a vibration of\u000ahaste, of anxiety, of emotion in his arms and hands, and the very\u000alappels of his coat which touched her breast, which was more real than\u000aany words, convincing her in a moment, as no explanation from Meredith,\u000afor instance, could have done, that the delay was none of his doing,\u000athat he was here as quickly as if he had come by that express train.
p17436
aV\u201cJanet!
p17437
aVYou mean that?\u201d he asked, with eyes that glowed even through the\u000adarkness, and a voice that thrilled and trembled too.
p17438
aV\u201cYes, Dr. Harding, if you do.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf _I_ do?\u201d he said, with a sort of suppressed shout, \u201cdid you ever\u000ahave any doubt of me?
p17439
aVMy little darling!
p17440
aVI\u2019m like your father, ain\u2019t I?
p17441
aVI\u2019ll be father and mother and husband all together now you\u2019ll have me,\u000achild!
p17442
aVIf I do!
p17443
aVHow dare you say that, you little torment; you little\u000adelight!
p17444
aVas if I shouldn\u2019t have rushed head over heels from the ends of\u000athe earth!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have taken your time about it, Dr. Harding,\u201d Janet said, \u201cyou might\u000ahave been here on Wednesday, and now it is Friday afternoon.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou little love!
p17445
aVHave you counted the days?\u201d cried the poor man, who\u000awas such a fool; and then he burst into his explanation, how he had\u000aindeed come from the ends of the earth, from one of the great towns of\u000athe North where he had found \u201ca noble practice\u201d awaiting him.
p17446
aV\u201cThey\u2019d\u000aheard of me, dear, fancy that!
p17447
aVHow surprised the Clover people will be!
p17448
aVAnd there will be fine company and grand parties, and everything she\u000alikes, for my little Janet,\u201d he cried, with a sort of sobbing of joy and\u000atriumph in his voice.
p17449
aVTo tell the truth, Janet was as much bewildered by the thought that\u000aDoctor Harding had been heard of, as anybody in Clover could have been.
p17450
aVBut she concealed this with a throb of delight in her heart to hear of\u000athe great town in the North, and the fine company and grand parties.
p17451
aVNo\u000aClover then and seclusion, but the world and all its delights.
p17452
aVJanet\u2019s\u000aheart beat high with satisfaction in her own wise impulse, and the sense\u000aof the triumph to come.
p17453
aVAs they stood talking, the door of the drawing-room was thrown open,\u000aand, looking up at the sound, they both had a view of the interior of\u000athe room illuminated with its bright firelight and with the lamp, always\u000athe first brought in, which stood on Mrs. Harwood\u2019s table.
p17454
aVShe in her\u000awhite shawl, with her white hair and cap and the mass of white knitting\u000aon her knees, stood out like a mass of whiteness made rosy by the light\u000afrom the fire, a most brilliant figure seen from the twilight of the\u000ahall.
p17455
aVThe doctor started a little, and took his hands from Janet\u2019s\u000ashoulders.
p17456
aV\u201cMrs.
p17457
aVAdolphus\u201d he said.
p17458
aV\u201cIt is Mrs. Harwood; do you know her?
p17459
aVBut, indeed, her husband\u2019s name is\u000aAdolphus.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou mean was: don\u2019t let us speak of him.
p17460
aVShe is an old friend of mine.
p17461
aVBut if it had not been for Adolphus Harwood I should never have been\u000adoctor at Clover, and perhaps never have seen my little Janet, so for\u000aevery trouble there is compensation, my dear.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat trouble?\u201d she said, eagerly.
p17462
aV\u201cNever mind.
p17463
aVCome in and introduce me, Janet--though we know each other\u000avery well.\u201d\u000a\u000aJanet took the arm he offered her and walked in, with all her spirit and\u000acourage restored, to Mrs. Harwood\u2019s room.
p17464
aVShe wished they had been all\u000athere, every one to see that she was not the lonely creature they had\u000athought her.
p17465
aVBut there was nobody but the mistress of the house, with\u000aJulia behind, telling her mother what they had seen during their walk.
p17466
aVMrs. Harwood was smiling; she had the air of a contented and cheerful\u000amother with no trouble in her way.
p17467
aVShe looked up to receive the\u000anew-comers, saying, \u201cWhy, Janet!\u201d with a little surprise, quickly\u000adivining from the girl\u2019s attitude and the air of the pair that something\u000aunusual had come in the governess\u2019s way.
p17468
aV\u201cI have brought an old friend to see you,\u201d said Janet, faltering a\u000alittle.
p17469
aV\u201cJohn Harding, at your service, Mrs. Harwood, now as long ago,\u201d the\u000adoctor said.
p17470
aVMrs. Harwood uttered a low cry, the color went out of her face, and the\u000alight out of her eyes.
p17471
aVShe sat and looked at him, with her under lip\u000afalling and dismay in her heart.
p17472
aVCHAPTER LI.
p17473
aVNothing, as Mrs. Harwood herself said, is so bad as you expect; and the\u000agreat shock which the sight of this stranger evidently gave her soon\u000asubsided in the extraordinary composure and self-command which she was\u000aable to bring to bear against every accident.
p17474
aVBy the time that it had\u000abeen explained to her who the visitor was, and what was his errand,\u000awhich he insisted at once upon telling, the conversation became what an\u000auninitiated person would have thought quite cosy and pleasant.
p17475
aVMrs.\u000aHarwood drew her breath more quickly than usual.
p17476
aVShe looked at the door\u000awith some anxiety, and she even sent Julia with a message whispered in\u000aher ear.
p17477
aV\u201cDon\u2019t let Dolff come in here.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy not?\u201d said Julia, aloud.
p17478
aVIt is inconvenient to have a daughter who has not the sense to obey.
p17479
aVMrs. Harwood made no answer, but pushed the girl away, and after a\u000amoment\u2019s pause Julia went, though whether to fulfil the message in the\u000amanner intended, her mother could not say.
p17480
aV\u201cThings have changed very much for us all,\u201d she said, in her cheerful\u000avoice; \u201cI have a daughter on the eve of marriage, like you, Dr.\u000aHarding--a man who does not marry keeps so much longer young.
p17481
aVYou may\u000aremember my Gussy as a child----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI remember my little wife that is to be as a child,\u201d he said, heartily,\u000a\u201cand she might well have despised an old fellow.
p17482
aVYes, things have\u000achanged.
p17483
aVIt was very good for me, as it turns out, that I could not go\u000aon in my old way.
p17484
aVI\u2019ve been a hard-working man, and kept very close to\u000ait for a long time, and now things are mending with me.
p17485
aVI shall be able\u000ato give this little thing what they all like--a carriage and finery and\u000aall that.
p17486
aVI am going back--to the old place, Mrs. Harwood----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo Liverpool?\u201d she said with something like a repressed scream.
p17487
aV\u201cYes, to Liverpool; they had heard of me, it appears, and then some of\u000athe old folks remembered I was a townsman.
p17488
aVYou have not kept up much\u000aconnection with the old place, Mrs. Harwood.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNone at all; you may suppose it would not be very pleasant for me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d he answered, drumming a little with his finger on his\u000aknee; \u201cand yet I don\u2019t know why, for there was always a great deal of\u000asympathy with you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDr.
p17489
aVHarding,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, with some eagerness and a nervous\u000athrill in her voice, \u201cmay I ask you a favor?
p17490
aVIt is, please, not to speak\u000aof me to any of my old friends.
p17491
aVYou may think it strange--there is\u000anobody else in the room, is there, Janet?--but I would rather the\u000achildren did not know more than is necessary about the past.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI understand: and I honor you, madam,\u201d said Dr. Harding, in an\u000aold-fashioned, emphatic way.
p17492
aVA faint tint of color came over Mrs. Harwood\u2019s face, which varied from\u000ared to white, no doubt with the agitation caused by the sight of her old\u000aacquaintance.
p17493
aV\u201cI ask for no honor,\u201d she said, hurriedly, \u201cso long as it is thought\u000athat I have done my duty by the children.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI should think there could not be much doubt of that,\u201d said Dr.\u000aHarding, who, in his own high content and satisfaction with himself saw\u000aevery one round him in a rose-colored light.
p17494
aVHe would have sworn she was\u000aan example to the country, had anyone asked him.
p17495
aVSo she was, no doubt,\u000afor had she not given shelter and protection to Janet, and somehow led\u000aher by example or otherwise to see that there was nothing so good in\u000athis world as to trust yourself to the man that loved you, whatever his\u000aage or his appearance might be?
p17496
aVJanet listened to this conversation with a great deal of her old\u000acuriosity and desire to find everything out.
p17497
aVShe did not see why her\u000adoctor should be bound by a promise to Mrs. Harwood not to speak to her\u000aof Liverpool.
p17498
aVJanet felt happy that it was not upon herself this\u000ainjunction was laid, and that she was free to talk about the strange\u000aoccurrences which had happened in St. John\u2019s Wood, and perhaps get to\u000aunderstand them better.
p17499
aVJanet, however, gave only a part of her mind to\u000athis.
p17500
aVThe rest was filled with her own affairs: her heart was beating\u000astill with the startling sensation of his arrival and the realization of\u000aall that must now follow.
p17501
aVShe had been a little afraid, when she brought\u000ahim into the bright light, of the revelations it would make.
p17502
aVBut the Dr.\u000aHarding who was about to enter upon a \u2018noble practise\u2019 in Liverpool was\u000anot at all like the Dr. Harding of Clover.
p17503
aVHis clothes were new and\u000awell-made, his hair carefully brushed, his linen dazzling--oh, he was\u000anot at all like the man who rode over on a shaggy cob to see Miss\u000aPhilipson, and was at everybody\u2019s beck and call around the Green.
p17504
aVLooking at him again in this favorable new light, Janet decided that he\u000awas not so very old--older than herself, no doubt, older than Meredith\u000aor Dolff, but not _so_ old--at the utmost no more than middle-aged--a\u000aman still in his prime.
p17505
aVShe did not do any talking herself, but let him\u000atalk, and she thought he talked well.
p17506
aVAll her thoughts had undergone\u000asuch a revolution within the last half-hour.
p17507
aVShe had felt herself\u000aabandoned, a creature all alone, cast off from everything, scorned on\u000aall sides.
p17508
aVAnd now all at once she had a defender in whose presence no\u000aone dared utter a jibe or make a scoff of Janet.
p17509
aVShe had wealth within\u000aher reach--a carriage (he said), all the prettinesses that life could\u000abestow.
p17510
aVNo such prospect was before Gussy, though she thought herself so\u000ahappy;--and the more Janet looked at him in these spruce clothes, the\u000amore her breast expanded with satisfaction.
p17511
aVHe was not merely Dr.\u000aHarding--he was something that belonged to herself.
p17512
aVAnd so manly--not a\u000aperson to be despised.
p17513
aVMeredith himself--why did she keep thinking of\u000aMeredith?--Meredith was a weakly person, a man who had let himself be\u000aalmost killed, not one who would stand against the world like John\u000aHarding.
p17514
aVPride and satisfaction swelled her breast.
p17515
aVShe too looked at\u000athe door as Mrs. Harwood did, but with a different meaning.
p17516
aVShe desired\u000athat they should all come in to see how much changed her position was,\u000aand that she had now someone belonging to her--someone who was better\u000athan them all.
p17517
aVBoth these ladies accordingly sat and listened to Dr. Harding without\u000ataking much notice of what he said.
p17518
aVHe filled them with emotions of\u000adifferent kinds, neither of them entirely on his own account.
p17519
aVThey both\u000alistened for sounds without while he talked, intently, anxiously praying\u000aand hoping on one side and the other that some one would or would not\u000acome.
p17520
aVMrs. Harwood had perhaps never been so deeply moved before.
p17521
aVTo\u000ahave made sure that no one would come--that this dangerous man might be\u000agot out of the house, without meeting Dolff at least, she would have\u000agiven a year or two out of her life.
p17522
aVThere were sounds, several times\u000arepeated, of people coming and going, doors opening and shutting, the\u000ausual sounds of a house full of people, which brought the blood coursing\u000ato the mother\u2019s heart.
p17523
aVShe put up her handkerchief to her face as if the\u000afire scorched her.
p17524
aVBut it was her trouble that scorched her, the great\u000aanxiety in which she was consuming her very soul.
p17525
aVAt last, in a moment, it was stilled, as our fears of an evil are\u000astilled, either because it has become impossible, or because it has\u000ahappened.
p17526
aVThe latter was the case in this instance.
p17527
aVDolff came into the room, and behind him Julia, very curious, and after\u000aher Priscilla carrying the tea-tray.
p17528
aVPriscilla and the tea-tray were\u000athings in which there was hope--but what Mrs. Harwood dreaded had\u000ahappened.
p17529
aVShe had no resource, but to say:\u000a\u000a\u201cMy son, Dr. Harding.
p17530
aVDolff, Dr. Harding is a friend of Janet\u2019s and--and\u000aan old acquaintance of mine.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow do you do?\u201d said Dr. Harding, rising up, formally giving the young\u000aman his hand.
p17531
aV\u201cI did not know your son was grown up.
p17532
aVI thought he was\u000athe youngest.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, it is Julia who is the youngest,\u201d said the mother, breathlessly,\u000aindicating the girl, who came forward and shook hands with Dr. Harding\u000atoo.
p17533
aVThough she had been in the room at his first appearance, there had\u000abeen no thought of introduction then.
p17534
aV\u201cIt is quite curious,\u201d said the doctor, with his hearty voice, \u201cto find\u000amyself among old friends.
p17535
aVI expected to find only my little Janet, and\u000ahere I am surrounded by people whom I knew in the old days in Liverpool\u000abefore she was born.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut we have nothing to do with Liverpool,\u201d said Dolff.
p17536
aV\u201cWelsh,\u201d said Mrs. Harwood, with breathless brevity.
p17537
aV\u201cAh, yes, by origin; the little property\u2019s there, isn\u2019t it?
p17538
aVBut Harwood\u000ahas been a well-known name in Liverpool for longer than any of us can\u000arecollect.
p17539
aVI remember when it was talked of like the Bank of England,\u201d\u000asaid the doctor, shaking his head a little and with a suppressed sigh.
p17540
aV\u201cOh,\u201d cried Mrs. Harwood, \u201cI am not fond of those old recollections;\u000athey always lead to something sad.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe had made another tremendous effort of self-control, recovered her\u000avoice, recovered her composure.
p17541
aVShe sat bolt upright in her chair, her\u000aeyes shining out like watch-lights, and all her color concentrated in\u000atwo red spots in her cheeks.
p17542
aV\u201cThis is very interesting to me, for I never heard of it before,\u201d said\u000aDolff.
p17543
aV\u201cMy mother has told us very little, Dr. Harding; I should be very\u000agrateful for a little information.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear young fellow,\u201d said Dr. Harding, \u201cI daresay your mother\u2019s very\u000awise.
p17544
aVLeast said is soonest mended.
p17545
aVThat\u2019s all over and done with.
p17546
aVIt\u000aall went to pieces, you know, when your father\u201d--he paused a moment,\u000avisibly embarrassed, not knowing what word to use; then added softly,\u000a\u201cwhen your father--died.\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Harwood drew a long breath.
p17547
aVShe sank back a little in her chair.
p17548
aVThe dreadful tension was loosed.
p17549
aV\u201cIf you think that this is satisfactory to me,\u201d said Dolff, \u201cyou are\u000amaking an immense mistake.
p17550
aVWhy should least said be soonest mended?
p17551
aVIs\u000athere any disgrace belonging to our name?
p17552
aVBesides,\u201d he said, himself a\u000alittle breathless, with an instinctive sense that his words were words\u000aof fate, \u201cmy father--is not dead.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat?\u201d said Dr. Harding.
p17553
aVHe jumped up from his chair as if he had been\u000astung.
p17554
aV\u201cWhat?
p17555
aVAdolphus Harwood not dead?
p17556
aVMy God!
p17557
aVAdolphus Harwood?
p17558
aVWhat\u000adoes this mean?\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Harwood was making convulsive efforts to speak, to rise from her\u000achair, but nobody heeded her.
p17559
aVDolff stood confronting the stranger, in\u000ahis ignorance, poor boy, fearing he knew not what, angry, beginning to\u000aawake to the fact that there might be need for defence, and that the\u000adanger was his own.
p17560
aVHe said:\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t know why you speak in such a tone.
p17561
aVThere is no harm, I suppose,\u000ain my father--being alive.
p17562
aVWe never knew till the other day.
p17563
aVPerhaps\u000a_she_ can tell you why.
p17564
aVIs there any harm in my father--not having\u000adied?\u201d\u000a\u000aHis voice had grown hoarse with an alarm which he did not himself\u000aunderstand.
p17565
aV\u201cHarm!\u201d cried Dr. Harding.
p17566
aV\u201cAdolphus Harwood alive!--harm!
p17567
aVOnly this\u000aharm--that I can\u2019t let old friendship stand in the way.
p17568
aVI dare not do\u000ainjustice; he must be given up to answer for his ill-doings.
p17569
aVHarm!
p17570
aVThe\u000afool!
p17571
aVHe never did but what was the worst for him!
p17572
aVto live till\u000anow--with all the misery and ruin that he brought----\u201d\u000a\u000aDolff frantically seized the doctor by the breast.
p17573
aV\u201cStop,\u201d he said, \u201ctell me what has he done?
p17574
aVI knew--I knew there was\u000amore in it; what has he done?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDone!\u201d cried the doctor, flinging the young man off from him, \u201cdone!
p17575
aVruined everybody that ever trusted in him!
p17576
aVDon\u2019t stop me, young man!
p17577
aVKeep yourself clear of him!
p17578
aVI cannot help it; I am sorry for your\u000asake--but he must be given up.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo what?\u201d cried Dolff, \u201cto what?\u201d He put himself in front of the\u000adoctor, who was buttoning his coat hastily and had seized his hat from\u000athe floor.
p17579
aV\u201cLook here!
p17580
aVto what?
p17581
aVYou don\u2019t stir a foot from here till you\u000atell me.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe had his arm up in mad excitement as if ready to strike, while Dr.\u000aHarding, a man of twice his strength, stood slightly drawn back prepared\u000ato defend himself.
p17582
aVThen there suddenly came between them, with a cry, a\u000amoving, stumbling figure, white shawl and white cap showing doubly white\u000abetween the dark-clothed men.
p17583
aVShe put one hand on Dr. Harding\u2019s breast,\u000aand with the other pushed her son away.
p17584
aV\u201cJohn Harding!\u201d she cried, \u201cJohn Harding!
p17585
aVlisten to me.
p17586
aVHe is mad--mad,\u000ado you hear?
p17587
aVMad!
p17588
aVWhat is that but dead?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMother, let this man answer to me!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, go away, go away with your folly!
p17589
aVHe is mad, John Harding!
p17590
aVHe came\u000aback to me mad--could I turn my husband to the door?
p17591
aVgive him up to the\u000apolice?
p17592
aVListen to me,\u201d she cried, holding the doctor\u2019s coat as if it had\u000abeen a prop to support her; \u201cyou can see him yourself, if you doubt\u000ame--he is mad.\u201d The poor woman burst into a shrill hysterical laugh.
p17593
aV\u201cMad as a March hare--silly!
p17594
aVOh, John Harding, John Harding, hear what I\u000ahave got to say!\u201d\u000a\u000aA sudden transformation came over Dr. Harding, such as may be seen in\u000ahis profession in the most exciting moments.
p17595
aVHe became a doctor and not\u000aan ordinary man.
p17596
aVHe threw down his hat and took her by the elbows, while\u000ashe still held fast by his coat.
p17597
aV\u201cWheel her chair forward,\u201d he said.
p17598
aV\u201cYoung Harwood, gently, send for her\u000amaid.
p17599
aVHeavens, boy!
p17600
aVbe gentle; do you want to kill your mother?
p17601
aVJanet,\u000acome round here and put the cushions straight, to support her head.
p17602
aVThere!
p17603
aVquiet all of you.
p17604
aVLet her rest; and you, Janet, give her air.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe has done it before,\u201d said Dolff, with passion.
p17605
aV\u201cOh, I am not taken\u000ain, mother!
p17606
aVLet her alone, man, and answer me!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGo to the devil,\u201d cried the doctor, pushing the young man away.
p17607
aV\u201cYou\u000aconfounded cub, be quiet, and let the poor woman come to herself?\u201d\u000a\u000aHad he forgotten all about the other, altogether, as if it had never\u000abeen?
p17608
aVHe looked like it, bending over Mrs. Harwood in her chair, giving\u000aquick directions, taking the fan out of Janet\u2019s hand to give her air,\u000amoistening her lips with the wine he asked for, absorbed in her looks as\u000aif there was nothing in his mind but the care of her.
p17609
aVJanet, too, ran to\u000aget whatever he asked for, stood at hand to do what was wanted, inspired\u000aby the doctor\u2019s devotion.
p17610
aVAs for Dolff, he turned away as if he took no\u000ainterest in it.
p17611
aVHis mother to him was a deceiver, getting sympathy by an\u000aexhibition of weakness.
p17612
aVJulia, half moved by her mother\u2019s faint, half by\u000aher brother\u2019s rebellion and excitement, wavered between the two,\u000auncertain.
p17613
aVJanet and her doctor alone gave themselves up to Mrs. Harwood\u000aas if there was nothing else in the world to think about.
p17614
aV\u201cSuch an effort as that to a woman in her state might be fatal,\u201d said\u000athe doctor.
p17615
aV\u201cShe must have the constitution of an elephant.
p17616
aVOnce before,\u000adid you say?
p17617
aVJanet, my little darling, you\u2019re made for a doctor\u2019s wife!
p17618
aVHold this fast--and steady as a rock.
p17619
aVNow, raise her head a little.
p17620
aVThere!
p17621
aVNow I hope she\u2019ll come to.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou make yourself busy about my mother,\u201d said Dolff, coming up to him,\u000astriking him upon the shoulder.
p17622
aV\u201cThere\u2019s nothing the matter with my\u000amother: but you\u2019ve got to explain to me--What does it mean?
p17623
aVWhat do you\u000awant with him?
p17624
aVWhat has he done?
p17625
aVI never knew he was there,\u201d cried the\u000alad, \u201ctill the other day.
p17626
aVAnd then I never suspected he was my father.
p17627
aVOh, don\u2019t you know when one never has had a father, what one thinks he\u000amust have been?
p17628
aVAnd then to see--that!
p17629
aVbut I must have satisfaction,\u201d\u000acried Dolff.
p17630
aV\u201cWhat has he done?
p17631
aVWhat are you going to do?\u201d\u000a\u000aAt this moment the door was opened hastily, and Gussy came in, followed\u000aby Meredith.
p17632
aVThere had been so much excitement in the house that they\u000aall came together for every new incident.
p17633
aV\u201cIs my mother ill?\u201d she said, with a glance at Mrs. Harwood in her\u000achair.
p17634
aV\u201cSomething has gone wrong.
p17635
aVDolff, who is this gentleman?
p17636
aVand for\u000aheaven\u2019s sake tell me what is it now?
p17637
aVWhat has gone wrong?\u201d\u000a\u000aOnly a glance at her mother, who was still but half sensible, supported\u000ain Janet\u2019s arms, and then Gussy came and stood by her brother\u2019s side,\u000aand looked at the stranger.
p17638
aVShe had no doubt that he had something to do\u000awith the secret in the house.
p17639
aVEverything clustered round that, and was\u000adrawing to it like flying things to the light.
p17640
aVDr. Harding, on his side, looked at the little crowd round him, meeting\u000atheir eager eyes with reluctance and embarrassment.
p17641
aV\u201cI presume that you are Miss Harwood,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I cannot explain\u000athis matter to you.
p17642
aVThe less you know of it the better, my dear young\u000apeople.
p17643
aVI have no ill-feeling to your poor father--not the least, not\u000athe least: though I was one of the victims, I hope I\u2019ve forgiven him\u000afreely.
p17644
aVBut justice is justice.
p17645
aVIf Adolphus Harwood is in this house, he\u000amust be given up.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDear Gussy,\u201d said Meredith behind her, \u201cwill you take my advice and go\u000aaway, and get Dolff to go?
p17646
aVLet me speak to this gentleman.
p17647
aVI know all\u000aabout the business affairs.
p17648
aVI am to appear for your mother, you know.
p17649
aVLet me speak to him, and hear what he has to say.\u201d\u000a\u000aGussy gave him a look and a faint smile, but did not move.
p17650
aVThey all\u000astood still gathered round the doctor like a ring, more anxious than\u000ahostile, and yet hostile too, hemming him in with a sort of enclosure of\u000apale faces.
p17651
aVDr. Harding was greatly moved; he put out his hands as if to\u000aput them away--to deliver himself.
p17652
aV\u201cGod knows,\u201d he said, \u201chow I feel for you, you poor children!
p17653
aVYou break\u000amy heart; but if Adolphus Harwood has been living quietly here, living\u000ain comfort and luxury here, after bringing so many to ruin----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe has been living,\u201d said Meredith, \u201cconcealed in a couple of rooms,\u000afor fifteen years.
p17654
aVI don\u2019t know who you are, or what right you have to\u000abe here, or to inquire into the affairs of this family.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, hush,\u201d cried Gussy, \u201che will be a friend, he has a kind face!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHis name is Dr. Harding,\u201d said Julia, breaking in.
p17655
aV\u201cHe came for Janet,\u000abut mamma said he was an old friend: and Dolff told him by chance that\u000a_he_--_he_, you know--was living, and not dead.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is all mere madness,\u201d said Dr. Harding.
p17656
aV\u201cI did not want to know\u000aanything about the affairs of the family, but I have my duty to do--I\u000amust do what is my duty.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere came a faint voice from behind--from the chair in which the mother\u000alay, only as it seemed half-conscious, propped by pillows.
p17657
aV\u201cSee him,\u201d it said.
p17658
aV\u201cSee him, see him; a doctor, he will know.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey all turned round startled, but it was Meredith alone who caught up\u000athe meaning of this half-stifled utterance.
p17659
aVHe put his hand on the\u000adoctor\u2019s arm.
p17660
aV\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, \u201cand look at the man for yourself.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe opened the door softly as he spoke.
p17661
aVThere had been sounds outside to\u000awhich no one had paid any attention till now.
p17662
aVThe lamp had been lighted\u000ain the hall, and it threw a strong light upon a man in a wheeled chair\u000awith white hair and beard.
p17663
aVHe was speaking in a note of half-whispering\u000acomplaint.
p17664
aV\u201cWhy do you bring me in, when I don\u2019t want to come in, Vicars?
p17665
aVDark--I\u000alike it when it\u2019s dark and nobody can see.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt don\u2019t do you no good, sir,\u201d said Vicars, \u201cto be out in the dark.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cVicars, you\u2019re a fool!
p17666
aVA man with money about him, a lot of money like\u000ame--you want me to be robbed, you villain!
p17667
aVAnd then how can I pay up?
p17668
aVWhen you know it\u2019s my pride to pay up, whenever I\u2019m called upon.
p17669
aVWhenever I\u2019m called upon--everybody!
p17670
aVThere\u2019s plenty for everybody.
p17671
aVAh!
p17672
aVthere\u2019s an open door!
p17673
aVI\u2019m going to see them, Vicars.
p17674
aVTheir mother tells\u000athem lies, but when they know I have it all here to pay up----\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, sir,\u201d said Vicars, \u201cyou can\u2019t go in there to-night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy not to-night?
p17675
aVDid she say so?
p17676
aVShe wants to get my money from me,\u000athat\u2019s what it is!
p17677
aVSwear, Vicars, you\u2019ll never tell them where I keep my\u000amoney!
p17678
aVShe got it and gave it to that fellow, but it came back, eh!
p17679
aVVicars?
p17680
aVIt knows its own master, and it always comes back.\u201d Here the old\u000aman burst into a foolish laugh, but presently began to whisper again.
p17681
aV\u201cWhere are you taking me?
p17682
aVYou are taking me upstairs.
p17683
aVYou want me to be\u000amurdered for my money in that dark hole upstairs.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe two men stood at the door, hidden in the curtain that hung on it,\u000aand watched this scene.
p17684
aVThey stood still, listening while the wheels of\u000athe chair rumbled along, and the door of the wing closed upon it.
p17685
aVThen\u000aMeredith spoke.
p17686
aV\u201cIs this the man you are going to give up to punishment?\u201d he said.
p17687
aVThe doctor turned away and covered his face for a moment with his hands.
p17688
aVWhen he turned round again to the audience, who watched him so intently,\u000aalmost without seeming to draw breath, he met the gaze of Mrs. Harwood\u2019s\u000aeyes, wide open, full of agonized meaning.
p17689
aVShe had come to herself and\u000ato a consciousness of all that depended upon the decision he would make.
p17690
aV\u201cWhat does he mean about the money?\u201d he asked in a low tone.
p17691
aV\u201cHe means,\u201d she said, answering him before any one could speak, \u201cwhat he\u000athinks he has in his pocket-book--money to pay everybody.
p17692
aVOh, John\u000aHarding, that\u2019s no dishonest meaning.
p17693
aVHe gives it to me, to pay up--and\u000athen he is restless till he has it back again.
p17694
aVThere\u2019s nothing but old\u000apapers, old bills, worth nothing.
p17695
aVHe thinks,\u201d she said, carried on by\u000aher eagerness, \u201cthat it is the money he took to Spain.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd where is the money he took to Spain?\u201d\u000a\u000aShe had not meant to say that; but there was only one in the company who\u000awas aware that she had betrayed herself, or understood the look of\u000abewilderment that for a moment came over her face.
p17696
aVShe paused, and that\u000aone who was in her confidence trembled.
p17697
aVShe raised herself up by the\u000aarms of her chair, and looked round upon them.
p17698
aVThen she burst into a\u000astrange hysterical fit of laughter.
p17699
aV\u201cHe thinks that I know everything,\u201d she said.
p17700
aV\u201cHow can I tell?
p17701
aVWhere are\u000athe snows of last year?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER LII.
p17702
aVThere are times when Nemesis appears unwitting at the door of a doomed\u000ahouse, and, however unlikely that might be, before she crosses the\u000athreshold, with the mere wind of her coming, the cunning webs of deceit\u000aare shattered, the blow of vengeance falls.
p17703
aVBut there are other cases in\u000awhich Nemesis comes and stands in the doorway and departs again\u000ainnoxious, either because some veil has been thrown over her\u000aclear-sighted eyes, or because the heart of that inexorable goddess has\u000afailed.
p17704
aVNemesis turned and departed from the house of the Harwoods when Dr.\u000aHarding went upstairs to the school-room with his little Janet.
p17705
aVThe\u000amiddle-aged gentleman there spent an ecstatic hour, the happiest of his\u000alife, and he forgot that there were such people as the Harwoods in\u000aexistence, or anybody worth thinking of except the little girl who had\u000acalled him to come and take her to himself--Janet, who had flung him\u000aover that dark October evening on the edge of the windy common at\u000aClover, but who had now whistled him back and put her little hand in\u000ahis.
p17706
aVWhich was more true to her real meaning--her refusal then, or her\u000adelighted acceptance now?
p17707
aVThe doctor never asked himself any such\u000aquestions.
p17708
aVHe was too happy to be allowed to think that when Janet\u000acompared the others, all the rest of the world, with him, who had loved\u000aher since she was a baby, she had found that none were so much to her\u000ataste as her old lover.
p17709
aVThat she had \u201cthem all\u201d at her feet, Dr.\u000aHarding had no doubt--how could it be otherwise?
p17710
aVseeing there was no one\u000alike her, no one!
p17711
aVIt seemed clear enough to him that both that cool\u000afellow downstairs who had taken the management of the business, and the\u000adolt--Dolff--what did they call him?
p17712
aVhad been at Janet\u2019s feet, and had\u000abeen rejected.
p17713
aVThe young fellows had done him a good turn.
p17714
aVThey had\u000ashown this little captivating creature, this darling little capricious\u000awoman who did not know her own mind, that there was nobody like her old\u000adoctor after all.
p17715
aVWhen he took his departure that night for the hotel where he meant to\u000astay until he could take Janet down to Clover to the vicarage from which\u000ahe was to marry her, there was no thought in his disturbed and rapturous\u000amind of the awful part which for a moment he had seemed about to play.
p17716
aVNot Nemesis--but Dr. Harding, an old fellow in love, and more silly than\u000aany boy.
p17717
aVAs for Janet, when her old lover left her, her little head was partly\u000aturned by his raptures, and by the opinion he had of her as if she had\u000abeen a queen, and all the gratitude and honor he seemed to think he owed\u000aher.
p17718
aVA little thing who had not a penny, and who, indeed, had thrown\u000aherself into his arms in a kind of despair because of her first\u000adisappointment and disgust with the world.
p17719
aVBut he did not know that at\u000aall, and she scarcely remembered it, when he took his leave with a\u000aprivileged kiss which made her cheeks burn, and a promise to come for\u000aher as early as possible in the morning, to take her out shopping, to\u000abuy what she would want against the great event, which was to be delayed\u000aonly as long as was necessary--not a day longer, he vowed.
p17720
aV\u201cFor you have cheated me out of six months,\u201d he said.
p17721
aV\u201cI might have had\u000ayou six months ago.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, no, no, Dr. Harding,\u201d said Janet, with gravity, remembering that\u000anothing in the world would then have made her accept the old doctor.
p17722
aVBut she had no such feeling as that now.
p17723
aVShe did not even remember that\u000ahe was a _pis aller_, and she looked forward to to-morrow, when she was\u000ato be taken out shopping, and to buy such things as she had never hoped\u000afor--dinner-dresses, morning-dresses ball-dresses; for she would require\u000aa great deal of dress, she had the sense to perceive, in that great rich\u000atown in the north, which was so very different from Clover.
p17724
aVJanet could scarcely think for the moment of anything beyond this, for\u000ait was a delight she had never enjoyed before.
p17725
aVTo buy, is a pleasure to\u000aevery woman--to get a number of new dresses, is a delight to any girl.
p17726
aVIf these things are accompanied by a heartbreak, as when she is going to\u000abe forced to marry a man whom she does not love, the pleasure\u000aevaporates.
p17727
aVBut this was not Janet\u2019s case.
p17728
aVShe had made up her mind to\u000ahave her old doctor, it is true, in a moment of pique and\u000adisappointment, and perhaps if he had come instantly as she had\u000aexpected, if he had not kept her waiting, if he had been still only the\u000adoctor of Clover--but none of these things had been.
p17729
aVHer heart had been\u000aracked with the thought that he, too, had forsaken her; and then he had\u000aarrived a new man, in those new, well-cut clothes, with all the\u000aconfidence of a great success about him.
p17730
aVAnd he had no sooner appeared than he had taken a commanding position.
p17731
aVThe father of the family had been in his hand.
p17732
aVDolff was nothing but a\u000afoolish boy beside him, and even Meredith--Dr. Harding had held the\u000aupper hand easily of them all.
p17733
aVHe had been able to put aside Janet while\u000athat crisis which she but half understood was going on, and then he had\u000acome back to her, and poured out gratitude and admiration; and she was\u000ato have a handsome house in Liverpool, where there was a great deal of\u000agayety, a great deal of wealth--and a carriage--and a day of shopping\u000ato-morrow with nothing to do but to say, \u201cI like this,\u201d or \u201cI like\u000athat!\u201d\u000a\u000aThus Janet\u2019s mind was satisfied, and her fancy delighted.
p17734
aVThose little\u000avagaries which had troubled her rest had all dropped into oblivion.
p17735
aVMeredith?
p17736
aVYes, he was going to marry Miss Harwood, to struggle into a\u000apractice at the Bar, though he was not at all hardworking, and probably\u000awould never be known except as an amateur tenor among his friends.
p17737
aVJanet\u000awondered maliciously whether they would sing as much together after they\u000awere married, or, if not, what they would do to amuse themselves?
p17738
aVand\u000acould not help the reflection that Gussy\u2019s accompaniments would probably\u000atire her husband, and that he would not conceal the fact from her in\u000athese after days.
p17739
aVShe wished them no harm whatever, none at all, they\u000ahad done her no harm: but still in her own room, as she was going to\u000abed, Janet could not but laugh at this thought.
p17740
aVMrs. Harwood had recovered in the most wonderful way.
p17741
aVIt was she who\u000akept up the conversation at dinner, talking to Dr. Harding of old\u000afriends, and, with her head high and another cap on, looking as if\u000aagitation or trouble had never come her way.
p17742
aVShe kept it up all the\u000aevening with a courage that never faltered.
p17743
aVIt happened before they all\u000aseparated for the night that there was a moment in which Meredith and\u000ashe were left alone.
p17744
aVHe went up to her, and took her hand in his.
p17745
aV\u201cYou are wonderful!\u201d he said.
p17746
aV\u201cI could not have thought it possible.
p17747
aVYou\u000aare able for any emergency.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe began to cry a little, with a laugh running through the sobs.
p17748
aV\u201cOh, Charley,\u201d she said, \u201cI hope it will all be forgiven me.
p17749
aVWhat could\u000aI do?
p17750
aVI had to hold by it.
p17751
aVAnd what would that have been among so many?
p17752
aVI shall be able to do justice to Gussy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo,\u201d he said, ignoring these last words, \u201cit would have been nothing\u000aamong so many.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou see that, too?\u201d said Mrs. Harwood.
p17753
aVAnd then she added, raising her\u000ahands in an appeal to the roof or the skies, \u201cHeaven knows that it was\u000a_them_ I thought of--my children--always, always!
p17754
aVall the time.\u201d\u000a\u000aNobody was aware of this momentary confidence, for Gussy came into the\u000aroom a little afterwards, and Meredith led her up to her mother.
p17755
aV\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have known it, dear Mrs. Harwood, for long,\u000aand, though there has been nothing absolutely said between us, I think\u000athat Gussy and I have understood each other for a long time.
p17756
aVYou will\u000agive her to me, won\u2019t you?
p17757
aVI will try to be worthy of her.\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Harwood\u2019s eyes were filled with tears.
p17758
aVThere was no hypocrisy in\u000athis, nothing but nature.
p17759
aV\u201cThat I will, with all my heart, Charley!\u201d she cried, and held out her\u000aarms to her daughter, who in the moment of emotion forgot everything,\u000aand forgave her mother who had done so much--had she done so much?--for\u000aher children.
p17760
aVGussy did not know all that the mother had done, nor at\u000awhat cost she herself was to be \u201cdone justice to.\u201d She only knew that\u000athere had been clouds upon the domestic firmament, and that they were\u000anow all blown away by delicious breezes of happiness and sweet content.
p17761
aVEverything was arranged afterwards with the authorities, and Adolphus\u000aHarwood, proved to be a harmless though hopeless lunatic, was left in\u000athe custody of his wife.
p17762
aVWhen the story stole out, it was as the story\u000aof a wife\u2019s devotion, which indeed it was, in some sort.
p17763
aVIt was said\u000athat he had wandered back to England, scarcely recognizable in his\u000amadness after he was supposed to be dead, and that she had then and\u000athere taken the tremendous task upon her of concealing him, caring for\u000ahim, watching and providing for his safety and comfort.
p17764
aVIt was a\u000atremendous task: nobody could exaggerate the weight of the burden that\u000ahad been upon her shoulders.
p17765
aVAnd those of the victims who heard of it in\u000afaint rumors after a time, were more disposed to shed tears over Mrs.\u000aHarwood\u2019s martyr life and her wonderful devotion then to take any\u000asteps--if any had been possible--to interfere with her custody of the\u000amadman.
p17766
aVThe vengeance of Heaven had overtaken that criminal who had been the\u000aruin of so many.
p17767
aVAnd, as for his poor wife, what was she but the first\u000aof the victims, the one who had suffered most?
p17768
aVThe story of the\u000apocket-book with which he was going to pay up every claim touched still\u000amore the hearts of those who heard it.
p17769
aVThey thought it proved that,\u000aunderneath all the misdoings which had overwhelmed his brain, there had\u000astill been an honest instinct, and that perhaps he had never intended\u000abut to give the money back.
p17770
aVIf Dr. Harding felt sometimes, when he\u000alooked back upon that strange scene, that there was something beneath,\u000ahe was the only one to whom that idea came.
p17771
aVAnd nobody suspected even,\u000awhat there had been in the pocket-book the first time Adolphus Harwood\u2019s\u000awife got it into her hands!
p17772
aVDolff threw up the university, which did him but little good, and the\u000amusic-halls, which did him less, and went down to the little property in\u000aWales which had come to him from his grandfather.
p17773
aVNotwithstanding that\u000ascene with Dr. Harding, he never understood clearly what his father had\u000adone.
p17774
aVHe married there, and was in a small way a gentleman farmer, and\u000agot perhaps as much good out of his life as if he had pursued the course\u000ahis mother intended.
p17775
aVPerhaps on the whole, even she admitted, it was as\u000awell that the name of Adolphus Harwood, which is a conspicuous name,\u000ashould not flourish at the Bar, which was a thankless profession; and\u000awhere even Charley Meredith, who had been always thought so clever, did\u000anot flourish as people had hoped, though fortunately he and his wife\u000awere sufficiently well off not to care.
p17776
aVAs for Janet, the little governess, the wife of the great Liverpool\u000adoctor, who acquired such fame in that northern capital, and was\u000aknighted, and as great a man as any in the place, her career is too\u000abrilliant for these simple pages.
p17777
aVAnd yet when I say that she was beyond\u000aquestion the best-dressed woman in the north of Lancashire, which is\u000asaying a great deal, where could there be found a sign more eloquent of\u000athe apotheosis and grand culmination of a favorable fate?
